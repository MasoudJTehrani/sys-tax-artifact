These naturally involve a higher number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) being connected using existing conventional in-vehicle network protocols such as Controller Area Network (CAN). In this context, security of systems is now becoming a major concern while industry's primary interest in the manufacturing of cars is reliability and safety. It is now in daily news that smart cars are being hacked due to weaknesses in their embedded electronics that provides ways of hardware attacks [1] [2]. Hardware Trojan (HT) is the threat that has been recently recognised as one of the primary sources of backdoor access that enables hackers to attack systems. As trouble, HT remains silent until a rare function/event triggers it for activation. This paper contributes to the challenge of demonstration of disruption in CAN buses raised from hidden Hardware Trojan. In this regard, it is presented how just a small size Hardware Trojan disrupts the CAN bus communication without an adversary having physical access to the bus. The attack is neither detectable via frame analysis, nor can be prevented via network segmentation; additionally, a rare triggering mechanism activates HT to process untraceable faults. © 2018 The Authors.

While in the considered applications it is possible to exploit a priori information relevant to the physical configuration of the target UAVs, and coarse knowledge of the relative position among aircraft, significant requirements exist in terms of the tradeoff between false positives and missed detections. The focus is set on medium/large distances among UAVs, and the presented solution combines adaptive template matching and morphological filtering to achieve reliable performance for variable background and illumination conditions. In order to minimize requirements related to computational load and vision system performance (e.g., minimum frame rate), navigation and cooperative information is used within the tracking algorithm. The adopted approach is tested on experimental data acquired in multi-UAV flight tests. First results demonstrate the potential of fusing information derived from cameras, onboard sensors, and target navigation system. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Given the limitations of acoustic and radio frequency (RF) communication underwater, light-based communication has also been used. Light-based communication is also emerging as an effective strategy for terrestrial communication. Can the emerging Light Fidelity (Li-Fi) communication standard be exploited underwater to enable devices in close proximity to communicate by light?

"Maximizing forest value through using Sentinel-2 in combination with hyperspectral UAVs","2018","Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065334190&partnerID=40&md5=effdfee8b8083f2fe47089994d80d209","The global forest economy is subject to a number of threats to its production value. Forest diseases keep emerging due to globalisation and climate change - they are difficult to contain and mitigate. According to FAO, in the period 1980-2002 more than 52 mill. hectares of forest in 37 countries were damaged by pests. Now the Pine Wilt Nematode is estimated to have the potential to spread to 34% of Europe by 2030. These changes are costing not only society, but also forest owners and managers. In Portugal, forest owners are fined 44,000 EUR by the government if they do not clear-cut diseased trees within 15 days. Forest fires are escalating in severity and costs due to climate changes. Europe lost in 2017 three times as large an area to forest fires than during the period 2008-2016 in total. The forest fires cost Portugal alone more than 200 mill. EUR and killed at least 66 people in 2017. These threats to the forest economy require accurate, precise and frequent information for monitoring their status and planning any relevant mitigation actions. Sentinel-2 becoming operational in 2015, and the impressive results of deep learning techniques, served as an ideal starting point for the automated forest monitoring service Silvisense. As its products were demonstrated with pilot customers in Portugal and Norway, it became clear that adding airborne hyperspectral acquisitions would increase the capacity to detect disease outbreaks at an earlier stage. An earlier detection would enable more efficient mitigation measures to take place and preserve a greater volume of high quality standing wood. This is the basis for the H2020 project FOCUS. The paper describes how FOCUS is expected to add value to forest monitoring in Europe through enhancing interpretation of Sentinel-2 satellite data by combining it with hyperspectral airborne measurements.

"Autonomous close-proximity operations in space: The PRoBa-3 rendezvous experiment (P3RVX)","2018","Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065286693&partnerID=40&md5=44231c4e8580e0eed1d905d56b4b33e3","Proba-3 is a Formation Flying (FF) technology demonstration mission from ESA. The main mission, covers the design, development, and in-fight operation of two small satellites, for the full-scale test and validation of FF mission architectures and techniques. Proba-3 has just finished the design phase and it is now starting the manufacturing and verification phase D aiming at launch before beginning of the next decade. The Proba-3 mission also offers a unique opportunity to test other technologies, including to perform Relative Dynamics Experiments (RDE). The Proba-3 RendezVous eXperiment (P3RVX) takes advantage of this opportunity to exploit the suitability of Proba-3 for the maturation of RV technology, in particular with non-cooperative targets, with two satellites, in a highly elliptical orbit (perigee and apogee height of 600 and 60,530 km, respectively), using optical Navigation. The P3RVX consortium is led by DEIMOS and includes the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and University Politehnica of Bucharest/Institute of Space Sciences (UPB/ISS). This paper provides an overview of the P3RVX, which aims to perform in-orbit demonstrations of the Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) subsystem (including the Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) functions), the operations, the autonomy approach, and the Verification and Validation (VV), for missions in highly-elliptical orbits with fast and time-varying dynamics. This includes, in addition, the in-flight testing of DTU's Vision Based System (VBS) software for non-cooperative scenarios. Typical close-proximity operations are considered, including non-cooperative rendezvous and forced-motion (inspection, approach/retreat, and station-keeping) maneuvers during perigee, with the latter being performed both in eclipse and in Sun-illuminated conditions. These high-level mission requirements are translated into the design of trajectories satisfying a number of constraints. In-house-developed tools are adopted to solve this problem, ensuring that the trajectories are passively safe - whenever possible - in case of an inhibiting failure. Moreover, trajectory design is required to consider the limitations of actuators, as well as sensors. The outcomes of P3RVX are aligned with ESA technology lines and, as such, are expected to have a significant impact on the community. In particular, in-orbit demonstration of autonomous GNC for elliptical orbits (in both fast and slow dynamic regions) and autonomous non-cooperative close-proximity GNC using a camera; provide technology developments generally applicable to future programs; and a significant maturation of these technologies, needed to support short- and medium-term Clean Space and ADR lines, as well as the development of Space Service Vehicles (SSVs).

Nevertheless, due to high-mobility of nodes and time-varying topology of networks, C-V2X networks always face many security threats. We identify a new Denial of Service (DoS) attack in which a small number of nodes maliciously reserve the communication resources in a C-V2X network by requesting high priority V2X services frequently. A malicious vehicle detection scheme is then developed to defend against this attack. Different from the detection methods based on traffic analysis, the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server only needs to focus on detecting nodes with high malicious probability in our scheme. Thus, we propose a model to estimate the probability that a node is malicious based on its communication resources consumption state. Simulation results demonstrate not only the feasibility of our attack but also desirable performance of the proposed malicious node detection mechanism. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
"Early detection as a tool to bridge prevention and response barriers for oil spills","2018","Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE International Conference and Exhibition on Health, Safety, Security, Environment, and Social Responsibility 2018","10.2118/190632-ms","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088068748&doi=10.2118%2f190632-ms&partnerID=40&md5=5d29818075ffb44afe2fffed46121617","Minimizing the footprint of marine operations in the O&G sector is of uttermost importance to ensure business sustainability. Oil spills due to a number of activities and hazards are one of the major concerns offshore. Risk assessments must carefully cover all possible control and recovery barriers and the appropriate response resources must be kept on guard against any event. The likelihood, consequences and vulnerability of the affected area shape the risk in any possible oil spill. Spillage rate and time of release depicture to a great extent the consequences of the spill, thus an early detection is crucial to minimize impact as well as to help reduce reaction time and resources scale for the responders. An early detection tool was satisfactorily put in place either in offshore production rig and maritime terminal, with specific capabilities for automated (unmanned) detection, 24/7 recording, remote surveillance, alarm logging and very low threshold detection level in adverse weather conditions. This means a digital transformation in the surveillance of marine operations allowing the exploitation of data to get the information needed to improve Safety in operations. With a threefold approach for innovative environmental protection, asset risk/integrity assessment and transparency culture promotion, a detection system was co-developed by operator and vendor to meet assets and operations needs and produce a tailor-made product. Such a novel system combines wide-coverage radars together with high-precision infrared cameras commanded and integrated by intelligent algorithms. Lessons learnt out of event reporting from this tool will be shared to help reinforce the link between prevention and response policies and protocols. Key tactical information for quick response, resources optimization, routine/critical operations monitoring, and real-time data sharing either internally or with third parties is yielded out of the System (HEADS) as a new input for a holistic and proactive approach towards asset protection. © 2018 Society of Petroleum Engineers.

Design space is determined by uncertainty analysis of design variables conducted in Part-I of this research. In this part, Box-Behnken Design of Experiments is done to analyze sample winglets uniformly spread over the design space. CFD analysis of all winglets was carried out using commercially available CFD software. Results of CFD analyses were used to generate three surrogate models based on polynomial fitting, single layered Artificial Neural Network and Multi-layered Artificial Neural Network. Detailed MANOVA was carried out to compare surrogate models from these three techniques. Subsequently all three models were subjected to Genetic Algorithm based optimization to search optima in the design space. Finally, all optimized winglets were again modeled and analyzed through CFD for their comparative analysis. It was observed that for models based on small number of data points, two layered ANN over fitted the model whereas single layered ANN was a better choice. Optimized winglet increased the lift to drag ratio by 14% and a drag reduction of 8% was achieved. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

VFE-2 was established to investigate the effects of Reynolds number, angle of attack, Mach number and leading edge bluntness on vortex properties above-blunt-edged delta wing. The original VFE-2 wing has 4 sets of interchangeable leading edge profile namely sharp, small, medium and large-edge ratio. There were lot of experiments and simulations data in VFE that compares sharp-edged with the medium-edged wings within the VFE campaign. This paper presents the current data on a blunter wing or large-edged wing. These experiments were conducted at UTM-Low Speed Wind Tunnel, Aerolab. The experiments were carried out at speed of 18, 36 and 54 m/s representing Reynolds numbers of 1×10                             6                             , 2×10                             6                              & 3×10                             6                             . Two measurement techniques were employed on the wing, i.e. steady balance and surface pressure measurements. The results obtained from the large-edged wing were compared with the results from medium-edge wing. The results showed that the primary vortex depends on the leading edge bluntness, angle of attack and Reynolds number. The results obtained from steady balance data showed that lift coefficient is sensitive to leading edge bluntness at higher Reynolds numbers. Several important observations were noted on the large-edged wing; i.e. the development of primary vortex has been delayed and the vortex breakdown occurred further aft of the wing. The data obtained provide a better insight into the leading edge effect on the delta-shaped wing and also for the development of Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) which most of them are integrated with delta wing technology.                          © 2018, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

According to the user behaviour around ARTS, the infrastructure is more important for VRU than expected. Painting the vehicle path on the street identifying clearly the crossings changes the perception of safety and priority, and at the same time, people get easily used to the new technology and have even started exploiting its safety. Overall, the system design will need to take care of these aspects to be fully functional. The results concerning the transport demand changes-assessed via stated preference (SP) survey in the demonstration cities to compare ARTS with conventional minibus both ex ante and ex post-show that users’ relative preference for the ARTS or the conventional minibus is case-specific, with the ARTS being relatively more preferred than the minibus in the application cases within a major facility, and that when an extra fare is applied to the ARTS service, the share of users who prefer the ARTS is significantly reduced in all cities. The user acceptance and the socio-economic evaluation show a high level of user satisfaction with the ARTS, mainly for comfort, information availability and safety, whereas security was not perceived as very good (due to the absence of a driver on board). © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, navigating natural and narrow waterways is challenging for low-cost ASVs due to possible obstacles and limited precision global positioning system (GPS) data. Visual information coming from a camera can be used for collision avoidance, and digital image stabilization is a fundamental step for achieving this capability. This work presents an implementation of an image stabilization algorithm for a heterogeneous low-power board (i.e., NVIDIA Jetson TX1). In particular, the paper shows how such an embedded vision application has been configured to best exploit the CPU and the GPU processing elements of the board in order to obtain both computation performance and energy efficiency.

We first prove that the original problem is NP-hard, and then propose a low-complexity approximate algorithm which performs within a bounded gap (a multiplicity factor of 1-1/ e) to the optimum.

Therefore, detecting, tracking and classifying the type of UAVs is important for surveillance and air traffic management applications. Existing UAVs detection works focus on radars, visual detection, and acoustic sensors. However, the work was done by applying Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) based methods to classify the UAVs need a large number of samples for feature extraction to train a model. In this paper, we propose a new small UAVs classification system using Auxiliary Classifier Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (AC-WGANs) based on the wireless signals collected from the UAVs of various types. Before the classification, using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), oscilloscope and antenna to collect the wireless signals, preprocessing and dimensionality reduction to represent information at a lower dimension space. The processed data from UAVs is input to the UAVs' discriminant model of the AC-WGANs for classification. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed system, which can achieve a recognition accuracy of around 95% in the indoor environment and can also be suitable in the outdoor environment. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
"Adapting to concept drift in credit card transaction data streams using contextual bandits and decision trees","2018","Proceedings of the 30th Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference, IAAI 2018","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102208578&partnerID=40&md5=cf51a149b4a2455f5cbbaddb48bb5638","Credit card transactions predicted to be fraudulent by automated detection systems are typically handed over to human experts for verification. To limit costs, it is standard practice to select only the most suspicious transactions for investigation. We claim that a trade-off between exploration and exploitation is imperative to enable adaptation to changes in behavior (concept drift). Exploration consists of the selection and investigation of transactions with the purpose of improving predictive models, and exploitation consists of investigating transactions detected to be suspicious. Modeling the detection of fraudulent transactions as rewarding, we use an incremental Regression Tree learner to create clusters of transactions with similar expected rewards. This enables the use of a Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) algorithm to provide the exploration/exploitation trade-off. We introduce a novel variant of a CMAB algorithm that makes use of the structure of this tree, and use Semi-Supervised Learning to grow the tree using unlabeled data. The approach is evaluated on a real dataset and data generated by a simulator that adds concept drift by adapting the behavior of fraudsters to avoid detection. It outperforms frequently used offline models in terms of cumulative rewards, in particular in the presence of concept drift. © 2018 Proceedings of the 30th Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference, IAAI 2018.

Autonomous cars have the potential to drastically reduce traffic accidents thanks to high-performance sensing and reasoning. However, their perception capabilities are still limited to the field of view of their sensors. We propose to extend the perception capabilities of a vehicle, autonomous or human-driven, with a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) capable of taking off from the car, flying around corners to gather additional data from blind spots and landing back on the car after a mission.

We design a centralized on-board unit that computes a new wing angle of attack according to the data received from the sensors. The on-board unit includes a local information database which represents its knowledge: it stores both the data gathered by the sensors and the fluid dynamics model used to compute and adjust the angle of attack. The on-board database is periodically updated transmitting all the measurements gathered from the sensors to a High-Performance Cloud Data Center (DC) which executes a parallel version of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CDF) algorithms, computes the updated model, and transmits the processed information back to the on-board unit.

When acquiring comprehensive and complete information of rock slope in a faster way becomes easier than ever in the support of novel techniques, research on integration of massive data is now thriving. To deliver an in-depth and detailed assessment on the failure mechanism of a coastal cliff, unmanned aerial vehicle and close-range photogrammetry are used in this research to produce high-resolution digital surface model. The case cliff is located on an abandoned old route of Suhua Highway in eastern Taiwan, where the old highway passes through a mountain ridge with single-line one-way old Heping tunnel. In replace of a former coastal highway that had collapsed under the Pacific Ocean, the old highway itself was abandoned also because of continual collapse. Successive landslides identified from 1974 to 2017 manifest a repeat cycle of collapse, rock blocks piled on the seashore, and rock blocks disappeared due to marine erosion. The cliff is high, steep and undulating with wave-cut notches. Unmanned aerial vehicles allow one to take pictures of a cliff from every possible angle of view, particularly the perpendicular and looking up views that traditional aerial photos fail to provide. The digital surface model generated from UAV images provides a convenient and detailed measure to investigate and survey the case cliff. Under the threat of plane sliding, wedge failure, flexural toppling and wave erosion, the continual collapse of the case cliff in the future is predictable. © 2018 ISRM & SRMEG (Singapore).","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Although it is a known phenomenon that Al alloys increase their strength and ductility at very low temperatures, it has not been attempted to exploit this effect to increase their overall formability at an industrial scale. Over the last four years, the cryogenic sheet metal forming behaviour of Al-alloys was extensively investigated to establish a process robust enough for manufacturing automotive parts at an industrial level. Initial experiments include tensile tests at temperatures down to –196 °C for characterisation of 5xxx and 6xxx series Al alloys, providing the mechanical material data for numerical design simulations of sheet metal forming processes at cryogenic temperatures. Numerical simulations will not be discussed in this publication. Furthermore, the necessary hardware for cryogenic sheet metal forming was developed and finally resulted in a semi-automated small scale industrial production site. The production of a miniaturized B-Pillar was demonstrated for 5xxx and 6xxx alloys. Due to the part’s demanding geometry, defect-free deep drawing process is possible at cryogenic temperature only. These results demonstrate that the use of Al alloys could be extended beyond their current applications in cars components. For example, the overall formability of 5xxx series alloys nearly doubles compared to room temperature.

This may include impact evacuation planning or object trajectory evaluation. A particular subset of planetary defense investigates mission designs to deflect threatening asteroids. Such designs have the main objective to drive the asteroid’s close approach as far as possible from Earth with a secondary goal that requires the asteroid to not have an Earth threatening event in the future. Work herein presents a new method for planetary defense mission design, which combines previous research in trajectory optimization with mission and system constraints, optimal asteroid deflection, and automated sensitivity analysis. Kinetic impacting spacecraft, one of the most studied and versatile deflection mechanisms, are used to present the developed method. The design shown here incorporates a trade study with mission and spacecraft parameters such as launch vehicles, engines, spacecraft power and planetary gravity assisted maneuvers. Such a large trade space makes it impractical for a mission designer to individually search all possible solutions. A fictitious asteroid Earth-impact scenario, considering realistic mission conditions, is used to illustrate the methodology.

Early detection and localization of the breast cancer tissues are vital for prevention and cure. Recently, there have been a number of developments on this front, particularly in the direction of automated image analysis. Although they are instrumental in expediting the process, such approaches lack the localization information and hence still demand substantial involvement of clinicians to deliver conclusive results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and localizing cancer tissues from mammograms. In particular, we rely on Convolutional Neural Networks for exploiting the spatial relationship of the cancer tissues for detection and localization.

Furthermore, our approach achieves the sensitivity of 86.1% in detection with 1.4 false positives per image on the localization.

In this paper, we show how knowledge can be transferred using semantic maps to new weather conditions without the need to obtain new ground truth data. To this end, we propose to divide the task of vehicle control into two independent modules: a control module which is only trained on one weather condition for which labeled steering data is available, and a perception module which is used as an interface between new weather conditions and the fixed control module. To generate the semantic data needed to train the perception module, we propose to use a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based model to retrieve the semantic information for the new conditions in an unsupervised manner. We introduce a master-servant architecture, where the master model (semantic labels available) trains the servant model (semantic labels not available). We show that our proposed method trained with ground truth data for a single weather condition is capable of achieving similar results on the task of steering angle prediction as an end-to-end model trained with ground truth data of 15 different weather conditions. © CoRL 2018.

Our target is to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly designing the transmit beamformer and artificial noise subject to the transmit power constraint of UAV. The resulting optimization problem is highly intractable and the key observation is that the original optimization problem can be equivalently transformed into a two- level problem. In particular, the inner-level problem can be solved by exploiting Semi-Definite Relaxation (SDR) and Charnes-Cooper transformation techniques, and the outer-level problem is handled by performing one-dimensional algorithm.

Current approaches include a variety of automated and manual processes to plan and adapt rover driving paths while leveraging a science and operations backroom to support tactical decision making. While perception and machine learning algorithms that can improve detection of terrain hazards and science targets are increasingly being used for Mars rover missions, strategic and tactical path planning still require extensive human-in-the-loop interaction and have not been developed specifically for lunar applications. This paper outlines machine learning tools developed at Mission Control with the goal of safer and more efficient rover navigation and planning. 1) A data-driven approach to terramechanics modelling is increasingly being considered state-of-the-art as it can capture phenomena that are hard or impossible to capture by traditional physics-based approaches. Mission Control's Autonomous Soil Assessment System (ASAS) can update slip-slope models in real-time for a specific terrain class detected by an automated terrain classifier and can dynamically adapt to changing terrain properties. This offers greater safety in navigating through non-geometric hazards that can threaten the rover's mobility. 2) For skid-steer vehicles such as many proposed lunar rovers, power consumption is dependent on turn radius along with other factors such as terrain type and slope. Path planners that implement a power model to minimize path energy can thus increase driving efficiency. Mission Control's Skid-Steer Optimizer (SSO) technology uses a data-driven power model with a sampling-based path planner that produce lower-energy paths compared to traditional distance-optimized path planners. 3) To autonomously and dynamically predict terrain slip and power consumption on a planetary surface with different terrain types, Mission Control is developing an N-terrain visual terrain classifier that uses deep learning techniques with semantic segmentation. This classifier can also be leveraged to detect targets of interest for survey or collection. Mission Control is developing an Intelligent Path Planner that integrates the aforementioned technologies to plan trajectories that avoid terrain hazards, reduce power consumption, and increase mission yield. Updates on these developments will be presented, along with results from a recent field test campaign to demonstrate ASAS at a natural analogue test site at White Sands National Monument.

Indeed, to reliably perform rendezvous and docking/undocking phases between space vehicles orbiting on highly non-Keplerian orbits, such as NRHOs, represents a fundamental key technology. Rendezvous is well-known for Earth centred missions, while no mission ever performed it on non-Keplerian orbits. The paper critically discusses the adopted approach and the obtained results in modelling the non-Keplerian relative dynamics and in synthetizing the guidance, to safely rendezvous and dock on NRHOs. The entire study is strongly driven by engineering constraints and mission requirements which lead the practical implementation. The dynamics intrinsic non-linearity - which makes the trajectories highly sensitive to small deviations - is here exploited to benefit both rendezvous operations and safety. The paper shows the relative trajectories, designed in a way that both NRHO central and unstable manifolds are used: the former to ensure the chaser relative orbit to be periodic with respect to the target, the latter to answer the passive safety philosophy here preferred. In fact, chaser deviation from target is naturally obtained, whenever on an unstable direction. Along the approaching trajectory, 2 holding points are assumed: on the central manifold the farthest, at about 100 km from the target, to prepare for the final approach; if a no-go is commanded, the spacecraft hovers on the central manifold, waiting for the next approach opportunity. The closest holding point is designed to lay on the unstable manifold direction, to privilege risk mitigation through passive safety, since if no active control occurs, the chaser - now just meters away from the target - naturally drifts away. The relative trajectory and approach strategy design, driven by the guidance and mission operations definition in nominal and non-nominal scenarios, is discussed in the paper: the simulations and the analyses that led to the approach corridor shape, Keep-Out Zones (KOZ) radius and Collision Avoidance Manoeuvres (CAM) settling are here reported. The practical case of the cislunar space gateway servicing is here exploited to present the proposed rendezvous and approach techniques for non-Keplerian scenarios and to highlight the GRANO software tool - developed by the authors at Politecnico di Milano, ASTRA Team - flexibility for general application in the n-body framework.

One of the important properties of sanguinarine is a pronounced ability to suppress thrombogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis. However, the low solubility of sanguinarine in biological fluids limits its medical use. The present research was devoted to the development of the liposomal form of sanguinarine and the study of its biological activity. We obtained liposomes with sanguinarine on the basis of lecithin and cholesterol by the method of hydration of a thin film with buffer, followed by sonication and extrusion through a polycarbonate membrane with a pore size of 100 nm. Purification of liposomal dispersion from a drug that was not included in the vesicles was performed by gel filtration chromatography. We studied the morphology of the obtained liposomal particles by scanning electron microscopy; particle size and zeta potential were determined by dynamic light scattering. The study of the dynamics of sanguinarine release was conducted using the method of dialysis; quantitative analysis of the released sanguinarine from liposomes was performed using reverse-phase HPLC. The cytotoxic activity (CTA) of liposomal preparation against tumor cells of human breast carcinoma MCF-7 line was determined by the MTT assay. The toxicity and biological effects of liposomal sanguinarine on the cultures of Paramecium caudatum Ehrenberg and Tetrahymena pyriformis WH1, as well as the study of the effect of the drug on the complement system, were evaluated using the automated video registration system “BioLaT” (Russia). According to electron microscopy data, the obtained liposomes were spherical nanosized particles (See Fig. 1). The mean size of the obtained liposomal particles with sanguinarine included in their composition, determined using the method of the dynamic light scattering, was 108.5±2.2 nm, and the zeta potential was –34.7±1.4 mV. The effectiveness of sanguinarine inclusion in liposomes was quite high and amounted to 72.8±4.8%. The study of the dynamics of sanguinarine release from liposomes in conditions close to physiological (pH 7.4; 37°C) showed that this process occurs at the highest rate in the first 2 h of incubation. Then, the process is prolonged (release of about 50% sanguinarine after 6 h of incubation, and about 93% after 70 h) (See Fig. 2). Liposomal sanguinarine showed dose-dependent cytotoxic activity against tumor cells of human carcinoma MCF-7 in the micromolar concentration range (Seе Fig. 3). The CTA of liposomal sanguinarine (IC                             50                              14.5 mM) was slightly lower than the activity of free sanguinarine (IC                             50                              9.4 mM), which can be explained by the prolonged release of sanguinarine from liposomes into the cell medium, as well as by the specificity of compartmentalization and intracellular release of the drug when it is absorbed by tumor cells by endocytosis. The prolonged release and the property of preferential accumulation of liposomes in tumor tissue can have a positive effect on therapeutic efficacy in the application of liposomal sanguinarine in vivo. The effect of liposomal sanguinarine on the survival of P. caudatum ciliates was dose-dependent (See Fig. 4). The minimum inhibitory concentration of liposomal sanguinarine was 0.49 mM. At concentrations from 0.245 mM and below, the drug did not cause cell death for 2 h; over the next 24 h, the death of the ciliates was neither observed. Thus, liposomal sanguinarine has a pronounced cytotoxic effect on P. caudatum, a representative of the protozoa, which can serve as the basis for the development of antiprotozoal drugs. To identify pathogenic Protozoa species spectrum vulnerable to the action of liposomal sanguinarine, additional research is required. We also assessed the influence of liposomal sanguinarine on the protective blood systems - coagulation and the complement system. The effect of liposomal sanguinarine on thrombus formation in vitro was evaluated in citrate plasma after its recalcification according to the time of the onset of thrombus formation and the resulting clot density (See Fig. 5). The clot size in plasma solutions with the addition of the drug was significantly smaller compared with the control. At the same time, liposomal sanguinarine induces the formation of a clot after 7 min of incubation, whereas in the control the formation of a clot begins only after 14 min of incubation. Thus, under the conditions of this experiment, liposomal sanguinarine had a pronounced stimulating effect on thrombus formation. Stimulation of thrombosis by liposomal sanguinarine can be caused both by direct activation of coagulation enzymes and by the induction of enzymatic reactions of the coagulation system, which can efficiently proceed on the surface of liposomal nanoparticles. The study of the effect of liposomal sanguinarine in a non-toxic concentration of 60 ng/ml on the functional activity of the complement system against T. pyriformis ciliates showed that the half-life of the ciliates as a target of the complement system in the medium containing serum and liposomal sanguinarine (T                             50                              21.7 min) reduced approximately twice compared with the control (T                             50                              41.6 min) (See Fig. 6). In the absence of serum in the samples, liposomal sanguinarine at a concentration of 60 ng/ml, on the contrary, had a stimulating effect on T. pyriformis growth - the value of the proliferation coefficient for native cells was 2.1±0.2, and for the treated cells it was 6.4±0.8. The obtained data may indicate the activating effect of liposomal sanguinarine with respect to the assembly of the membrane attack complex of the complement system on the surface of T. pyriformis cells, causing their death. This effect allows to envisage the prospect of using liposomal sanguinarine as an immunostimulating agent. Thus, the pronounced cytotoxic antitumor and antiprotozoal activity, demonstrated in experiments in vitro, makes it possible to consider liposomal sanguinarine as a promising antitumor and antiprotozoal agent. The detected effect of thrombosis stimulation by liposomal sanguinarine seems to be important when selecting the dose of the drug introduced into the bloodstream.                          © 2018 Tomsk State University.

Since rarely can either the location or the time of an attack be anticipated, efficient real-time surveillance of a potential target is of paramount importance. Such surveillance is usually performed by dedicated devices carried on manned or unmanned land, sea or air platforms. The use of manned platforms for such tasks could entail high risks for the crew, while unmanned ones can operate with considerable less constrains and in harsher environments.

Uncontrolled use of such UAVs in the context of public events like sports events or demonstrations, as well as their use near sensitive areas, such as airports or correctional facilities pose a potential security threat. Automatic early detection of UAVs is thus an important task which can be addressed through multiple modalities, such as visual imagery, radar, audio signals, or UAV control signals. In this work we present an image processing pipeline which is capable of tracking very small point targets in an overview camera, adjusting a tilting unit with a mounted zoom camera (PTZ system) to locations of interest and classifying the spotted object in this more detailed camera view. The overview camera is a high-resolution camera with a wide field of view. Its main purpose is to monitor a wide area and to allow an early detection of candidates, whose motion or appearance warrant a closer investigation. In a subsequent process these candidates are prioritized and successively examined by adapting the orientation of the tilting unit and the zoom level of the attached camera lens, to be able to observe the target in detail and provide appropriate data for the classification stage. The image of the PTZ camera is then used to classify the object into either UAV class or distractor class. For this task we apply the popular SSD detector. Several parameters of the detector have been adapted for the task of UAV detection and classification. We demonstrate the performance of the full pipeline on imagery collected by the system. The data contains actual UAVs as well as distractors, such as birds. © COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Different from previous work, we remove the assumption that the target vehicle has perfect knowledge of the states of the defending and attacking missiles by estimating their vehicle states through range and heading measurements. Using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) the vehicle states are estimated through the non-linear measurement equations; as a result, this scenario is solved using stochastic-estimation in conjunction with optimal control theory. In order to accomplish the numerical computation of the optimal control, where an objective function containing estimated states is minimized, we use a shooting method involving Monte-Carlo state averages. We begin the analysis by deriving the governing analytical dynamics and measurement equations. Next we compute the analytical Jacobians required for the implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Using the EKF to estimate the state space we feed the state averages from Monte-Carlo to an objective function whose minimization produces an optimal control. By formulating the objective function to maximize distance from the attacking missile and target vehicle and to minimize the range from the defending missile to the attacking missile, the optimal input of target vehicle heading rate is computed for target vehicle to escape its attacker and aid the closure of the defending and attacking missiles. A scenario involving the three agents is simulated in two-dimensional space using the derived equations of motion, and the results from the computed optimal control are presented with discussion. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Cameras onboard autonomous and remotely operated vehicles can capture high-resolution images to map the seafloor; however, underwater image formation is subject to the complex process of light propagation through the water column. The raw images retrieved are characteristically different than images taken in air due to effects, such as absorption and scattering, which cause attenuation of light at different rates for different wavelengths. While this physical process is well described theoretically, the model depends on many parameters intrinsic to the water column as well as the structure of the scene. These factors make recovery of these parameters difficult without simplifying assumptions or field calibration; hence, restoration of underwater images is a nontrivial problem. Deep learning has demonstrated great success in modeling complex nonlinear systems but requires a large amount of training data, which is difficult to compile in deep sea environments. Using WaterGAN, we generate a large training dataset of corresponding depth, in-air color images, and realistic underwater images. These data serve as input to a two-stage network for color correction of monocular underwater images.

However, previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of using physical adversarial examples to attack image classification systems. In this work, we argue that the success of realistic adversarial examples is highly dependent on both the structure of the training data and the learning objective. In particular, realistic, physicalworld attacks on semantic segmentation and steering angle prediction constrain the adversary to add localized perturbations, since it is very difficult to add perturbations in the entire field of view of input sensors such as cameras for applications like autonomous vehicles. We empirically study the effectiveness of adversarial examples generated under strict locality constraints imposed by the aforementioned applications. Even with image classification, we observe that the success of the adversary under locality constraints depends on the training dataset. With steering angle prediction, we observe that adversarial perturbations localized to an off-road patch are significantly less successful compared to those on-road. For semantic segmentation, we observe that perturbations localized to small patches are only effective at changing the label in and around those patches, making non-local attacks difficult for an adversary. We further provide a comparative evaluation of these localized attacks over various datasets and deep learning models for each task.  © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

I3DS is co-funded under the Horizon 2020 EU research and development program and is part of the Strategic Research Cluster on Space Robotics Technologies. The ambition of I3DS is to produce a standardised modular Inspector Sensor Suite (INSES) for autonomous orbital and planetary applications for future space missions. Orbital applications encompass activities such as on-orbit servicing and repair, space rendezvous and docking, collision avoidance and active debris removal (ADR). Simultaneous localisation and surface mapping (SLAM) for planetary exploration and general navigation in an unknown environment for scientific purposes can be considered in planetary applications. These envisaged space applications can be tackled by exploiting the flexibility, high performance and long product life of FPGAs. Conventional FPGAs are subject to Single Event Upsets (SEU) due to space radiation, causing their failure. Therefore, space-graded FPGAs, such as those developed by Xilinx, are targeted within the I3DS project. Currently, the main use of the FPGA within the development of this robust end-to-end multi-sensor suite is for navigation and data pre-processing. The aim of this paper is to assess the capabilities of FPGAs to carry out complex operations, such as running navigation algorithms for space applications. The motivation for the development of the on-board software architecture is as follows: raw data, acquired from the various sensors - including, among others, a High Resolution camera, a stereo camera and a LiDAR - is pre-processed to ensure the provision of robust and optimised inputs to 3D navigation algorithms. Noise reduction and conversion into suitable formats for the successful application of navigation algorithms are therefore the main aims of the data pre-processing. Some techniques adopted in this phase include outlier rejection and data dimensionality reduction for large point clouds, e.g. from LiDAR, and geometric and radiometric correction of the images from the cameras. The pre-processed data will then feed state-of-the-art relative navigation algorithms. Some of the proposed navigation algorithms include Generalised Iterative Closest Point (GICP) for dense 3D point clouds, relative positioning with fiducial markers, and visual odometry. The system environment for the preliminary operation is a test-bench setup formed by a standard desktop computer and a non-space-graded FPGA (Xilinx UltraZed-EG FPGA). The choice of FPGA was based on the similarity of this board to other space-graded ones also provided by Xilinx. Experimental tests on the algorithms are being performed in the framework of the validation campaign for the I3DS project. Preliminary results indicate that the data pre-processing can be efficiently carried out on the FPGA board.

Methane and coal dust explosions are the most dangerous threats in these environments, and toxic gases post-explosions are other cause of death for rescuers.

TeleRescuer is a project composed of European interdisciplinary actors, forming a well-balanced consortium. The aim of the project is to develop a system for the virtual teleportation of rescuers to the subterranean areas of a coal mine that have been closed due to a catastrophic event within them.

The plans for any security or disaster operation in a megacity involves a full spectrum of capabilities, spanning both government/military and civil roles in the face of natural or adversarial threats. The security resources of a megacity may also be called upon in more non-security/defence missions to protect or sustain life, such as SAR. This paper discusses the maritime capability required to support the search and surveillance operations within and around the megacity. The overall capability is delivered by an integration of manned, unmanned and autonomous systems, including the use of swarm technology. Specific domain capabilities include: littoral and harbour areas; riverine and canal operations; underwater operations; urban airspace, with tethered and untethered C4ISTAR sensors; road, cross-country and tunnels. The maritime system proposed in this paper consists of a fleet of modular platform vessels, based on a 25m SES (Surface Effect Ship), operating within a common command infrastructure. Where a range of platforms are deployed from the vessels depending on the situation requirements. The recognised stake-holder informed Marine Design approach is applied to the platform system and sub-systems development, which also draws on the results of horizon scanning activities to identify the technological and cultural developments that are anticipated.

Indeed, we build a duopoly model to capture the adversarial behavior of UAVs operators in terms of their pricing and availability strategies. That is UAVs operators need to decide about the optimal beaconing period (period needed to send short messages advertising the existence of a UAV) while saving energy. Furthermore, they need to decide about the best price strategy in order to maximize their respective market share. Therefore, a tractable analysis for the game's Nash Equilibrium, both in terms of pricing and availability is derived. We show that this special game exhibits some very interesting properties as it is sub-modular with respect to the availability policy, whereas it is super-modular with respect to the service fee. Furthermore, we implement a learning scheme using best-response dynamics that allows operators to learn their joint pricing-availability strategies in a fast, accurate yet completely distributed fashion. Extensive simulations show the convergence of the proposed schemes to the joint pricing-availability Nash equilibrium and provide attractive insights on how the game parameters could be set to control the duopoly. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this regard, exploiting unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms is a promising solution to inspect vast areas efficiently and with low cost. In fact, UAVs can easily fly and reach inspection points, record surveillance data, and send this information to a wireless base station (BS). Nonetheless, in many cases, such as operations at remote areas, the UAVs cannot be guided directly by the BS in real- time to find their path. Moreover, another key challenge of inspection by UAVs is the limited battery capacity. Thus, realizing the vision of autonomous inspection via UAVs requires \emph{energy-efficient path planning} that takes into account the energy constraint of each individual UAV. In this paper, a novel path planning algorithm is proposed for performing energy-efficient inspection, under stringent energy availability constraints for each UAV. The developed framework takes into account all aspects of energy consumption for a UAV swarm during the inspection operations, including energy required for flying, hovering, and data transmission. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can address the path planning problem efficiently in polynomial time. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can yield substantial performance gains in terms of minimizing the overall inspection time and energy. Moreover, the results provide guidelines to determine parameters such as the number of required UAVs and amount of energy, while designing an autonomous inspection system. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

By capturing traffic traces between users and their Tor entry guard, a network eavesdropper can leverage this meta-data to reveal which website Tor users are visiting. The success of such attacks heavily depends on the particular set of traffic features that are used to construct the fingerprint. Typically, these features are manually engineered and, as such, any change introduced to the Tor network can render these carefully constructed features ineffective. In this paper, we show that an adversary can automate the feature engineering process, and thus automatically deanonymize Tor traffic by applying our novel method based on deep learning. We collect a dataset comprised of more than three million network traces, which is the largest dataset of web traffic ever used for website fingerprinting, and find that the performance achieved by our deep learning approaches is comparable to known methods which include various research efforts spanning over multiple years. The obtained success rate exceeds 96% for a closed world of 100 websites and 94% for our biggest closed world of 900 classes. In our open world evaluation, the most performant deep learning model is 2% more accurate than the state-of-the-art attack. Furthermore, we show that the implicit features automatically learned by our approach are far more resilient to dynamic changes of web content over time. We conclude that the ability to automatically construct the most relevant traffic features and perform accurate traffic recognition makes our deep learning based approach an efficient, flexible and robust technique for website fingerprinting. © 2018 25th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, NDSS 2018.

"Human Dignity in an Age of Autonomous Weapons: Are We in Danger of Losing an 'Elementary Consideration of Humanity'?","2018","Baltic Yearbook of International Law","10.1163/22115897_01701_009","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197765045&doi=10.1163%2f22115897_01701_009&partnerID=40&md5=b62bb5424dab622aa976a627ce6e1b08","Military investment in robotics technology is leading to development and use of autonomous weapons, which are machines with varying degrees of autonomy in target, attack, and infliction of lethal harm (that is, injury, suffering or death). Examples of autonomous weapons include weapons systems involving levels of automation and remotely controlled human input, unmanned armed aerial vehicles (uav), remotelycontrolled robotic soldiers, bio-augmentation, and 3D printed weapons. Autonomous weapons generally fall into one of two categories: semi-autonomous, involving some degree of autonomy in certain critical functions such as acquiring, tracking, selecting, and attacking targets, along with a degree of human input or remote control (for example, uav or 'drones'); and autonomous, involving higher levels of independent thinking as regards critical functions without the need for human input or control (for example, US Navy X-47B uav with autonomous take-off, landing, and aerial refuelling capability). The trend is clearly towards developing autonomous weapons. Development of new weapons aimed at reducing costs and casualties is not a new phenomenon in warfare. Technological advances have created greater distance between the soldier and the battlefield. A bullet fired from a rifle handled by a human has been superseded by a missile fired from a remotely controlled or autonomous machine. So what makes autonomous weapons different? What particular challenge do they pose international law? Although autonomous weapons may be employed to attack nonhuman targets, such as state infrastructure, here I am primarily concerned with their use for lethal attacks against humans. In this chapter I focus on autonomous weapons (both semi-autonomous and fully autonomous) and their impact on human dignity under two of Kant's conceptual strands: (1) human dignity as a status entailing rights and duties; and (2) human dignity as respectful treatment. Under the first strand I explore how use of autonomous weapons denies the right of equality of persons and diminishes the duty not to harm others. In the second strand I consider how replacing human combatants with autonomous weapons debases human life and does not provide respectful treatment. Reference is made to contemporary development of Kant's conceptual strands in icj and other international jurisprudence recognising human dignity as part of 'elementary considerations of humanity' in war and peace. © 2020 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

Angle-of-attack and sideslip angle are measured rather than estimated, and automated control surface excitation inputs consisting of doublets, triplets, and frequency sweeps are implemented and used to assure consistency in the excitation and to eliminate errors introduced by manually applied user inputs. A real-time vehicle monitoring system is used to provide a human-in-the-loop model update capability, with a goal of ensuring the safety of the vehicle. A combined lateral/directional and longitudinal excitation is developed and demonstrated for identifying a full dynamic system and representing it in state-space form. The methodology is demonstrated with flight tests of a fixed-wing Small Unmanned Air System, with locally linear models generated onboard the vehicle during flight. Results presented in the paper show that the system is capable of reliably and repeatedly generating accurate locally linear models that are suitable for real-time flight control design using model based control techniques and post-flight modal analysis. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The world has started to move towards the autonomous world. However, in terms of security and safety of humans from antisocial threat person, technology has not achieved its peak in providing autonomous system. Places such as airport, railways stations, and malls are well secured either by metal detectors or by manual scrutiny. Moreover, the current scenario demands a very high security in common places such as hospital, schools, and community halls where manual security checks might not be possible. In this work an autonomous system is developed to detect and track concealed weapons with potential to stop the threat person before causing any harm or danger. The system achieves its task by carrying out three main functions in a sequential order. A microwave sensor and metal detector together detects the concealed weapon by means of the Doppler shift in the radiation and eddy currents induced in the metal respectively. Secondly, the output voltage from the microwave senor is processed by a microcontroller. Lastly, a DC motor attached with a laser pointer, receives input from microcontroller such that rotates in a direction pointing the concealed weapon. © 2018 Authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The vehicles in the system can communicate by transmitting messages to another vehicle or servers. In order to detect and discard messages from attackers, the receivers need to authenticate the message that normally requires the identity of the sender. This leads to the privacy violation of the sender because the user’s identity is sent in clear text in the transmitted messages, and thus it can be linked to the vehicle’s sensitive information. To overcome this issue, pseudonyms are provided to vehicles and servers and then the receivers request a trusted authority (TA) to authenticate the sender with its pseudonym. However, it faces the congestion challenge since the number of exchanged messages in a real ITS is extremely large. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art solutions to the privacy preserving in authentication and then propose an authentication scheme to preserve senders’ privacy in ITS. In this scheme, the vehicles and servers need to contact TA only one time to get secret information and then, based on their secret information, they can generate pseudonyms for the authentication at the receiver side. Some scenarios are also provided for the security analysis of the schemes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Autonomous capabilities in USVs can reduce the costs of reaching into distant environments and using that reach to meet a particular mission's objectives. However, to take on increased autonomy in unmanned systems, USVs will increasingly require the ability to be untethered from human interaction, and a key enabler to effecting this is accurate navigation. USVs have traditionally depended on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which are known to have security and safety vulnerabilites. Using systems-theoretic process analysis (STPA), this paper provides systematic analyses of the attack surfaces and of the impact of cyber attacks against the navigational aspects of Unmanned Surface Vehicles. As part of these analyses, we identify potential threats, vulnerabilities and attacks in the Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) functionalities of USVs. These analyses can be used to drive a USV's architecture, leading to the design of more effective and secure USV operations. Copyright © by the paper's authors.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This paper will provide the theoretical concept of a navigation system which will be based on the pseudolite methodology and/or terrestrial-like distance and angle measurements. The concept proposes the high accuracy positioning system which will be based on developing the crater control network. Such network consists of two sets of the control points (the external frame and the internal network) around and within the crater, assuring mutual visibility. Precise positioning, within the scope of this research, means the capability to locate a tool, an object or a facility inside a crater with accuracy of few centimetres and even better (below cm). This accuracy is needed for positioning and precise navigating of construction machines and the principal points of the facilities that are to be built in the crater. Counting on the fact that construction works in the craters will have a local character, meaning that just certain parts of the crater will be exploited in a single period, the internal network points will be constructed as mobile facilities. That will allow high precision on micro-locations, without the need of maintaining the network around the not used areas. The internal network is connected to the external frame, providing the consistency of the coordinate system. Each internal control network point is equipped with a robotized total station, supported by an attached 360 degrees reflective prism and a camera. The total stations are operated remotely, from a monitoring station. Determination of the internal control network points is performed by the trilateration/triangulation measurements between them and the external frame points. The coordinates of the internal network points are adjusted in the sense of the constrained network, within the external frame coordinate system. The external reference frame is determined as the free network, created by the mutual measurements between the external frame points. There are two possible measurement models: (1) the same principle of distance and angle measurements as a in the internal network or (2) pseudolite (GNSS-like) measurements. Such model of Lunar local navigation system increases the landing accuracy of human or autonomous vehicles as well. Nevertheless, the proposed methods give a broad spectrum of ideas, how common surveying methods, applied on Earth, could be transposed and rearranged to be applicable on the Moon.

To avoid such incidents in future, it is essential to be able to detect UAVs. LiDAR sensors (e.g., laser scanners) are well known to be adequate sensors for object detection and tracking. In this paper, we expand our existing LiDAR-based approach for the tracking and detection of (low) flying small objects like commercial mini/micro UAVs. We show that UAVs can be detected by the proposed methods, as long as the movements of the UAVs correspond to the LiDAR sensor's capabilities in scanning performance, range and resolution. The trajectory of the tracked object can further be analyzed to support the classification, meaning that UAVs and non-UAV objects can be distinguished by an identification of typical movement patterns. A stable tracking of the UAV is achieved by a precise prediction of its movement. In addition to this precise prediction of the target's position, the object detection, tracking and classification have to be achieved in real-Time. For the algorithm development and a performance analysis, we analyzed LiDAR data that we acquired during a field trial. Several different mini/micro UAVs were observed by a system of four 360° LiDAR sensors mounted to a car. Using this specific sensor system, the results show that UAVs can be detected and tracked by the proposed methods, allowing a protection of the car against UAV threats within a radius of up to 35 m. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

This vehicle serves as a platform for our groups autopilot development and distributed swam control experiments due its payload capacity and generally stable handling qualities. This work supplies an aerodynamic model to better design our groups flight level autopilot. Wind tunnel testing of a scaled 3D printed vehicle model was conducted with a robotic positioning system and six component force balance which allowed for both static and dynamic measurements. Time averaged data taken across a range of angle of attack and sideslip were used to determine the static flight stability derivatives and explore the flight envelope. Static testing was also performed at a range of control surface deflections to determine the control derivatives. Constant frequency forced oscillation testing was conducted to estimate the second order coefficients, or damping derivatives. Static thrust testing was performed to model the thrust force during flight.

A number of threats are located throughout the region and stand as impediments for the UAV to reach the target. The lead UAV enlists the aid of teammate UAVs, who possess the ability to counteract the threats, thus reducing the risk to the lead UAV as it passes nearby. We seek the lead UAV’s path and the teammate UAVs’ assignments to threats so as to minimize the competing objectives of lead UAV’s path risk and distance traveled. The teammate UAV assignments must be temporally and spatially coordinated with the lead UAV so as to produce the desired risk reduction. In the single vehicle minimal risk path problem, a standard approach is to generate a Voronoi diagram, which contains the edges that are equidistant from threat locations around it. This single vehicle would then find the optimal path along the edges of the Voronoi graph. Similar to the single vehicle problem, in this paper the lead vehicle path is constrained to follow the Voronoi edges with the additional complication of determining the optimal teammate assignment. This problem is difficult because of the temporal and spatial coupling of the lead aircraft’s optimal trajectory with the allocation of the teammates. We aim to solve this joint path-assignment problem by transforming this into a well-studied combinatorial problem, the shortest path problem. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Rapid technological development in the twentieth century enabled the intelligence community to gather, analyze, and disseminate information at a pace and magnitude that was never before possible. Examples of this include the role of radio technology in revolutionizing communication intelligence as well as aircraft and satellite reconnaissance that provided much-needed intelligence on Soviet weapons capabilities and enabled an increase in intelligence gathering from denied areas across the world. More recent examples that demonstrate the prominence of technology in intelligence gathering include the operation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for surveillance of Iran’s weapons capabilities and of Osama bin Laden’s complex in Pakistan. The advent of the information age has further revolutionized these processes.

Search And Rescue (SAR) domain is the primary market; as well as other maritime application domains; however, other side markets are identified in Safety and Security areas, with specific focus on stakeholders in charge of ensuring Surveillance (to avoid intrusions and detect potential threats within wide open areas), especially during major events or with reference to infrastructures under construction. The need for such a solution comes in particular from the institutional market (but it is not limited to) requesting a technological support to manage migration flux aspects, with particular attention to crisis in the Mediterranean Sea: Europe needs to balances efforts to assist people in need with efforts to secure its borders. On the basis of the above scenario, the industrial composition of the SARA consortium has been contacted by Italian Coast Guard two years ago in order to provide a technological contribution supporting vessels to detect people lost in the sea, especially during the hours of darkness. According to the above request, SARA solution is conceived to build up a semi-automated system using Earth Observation data to preliminary detect suspect pontoons' trajectories (Surveillance) and supporting SAR operations based upon a deployable RPA (Remotely Piloted Aircraft) which is tightly coupled with a ship architecture through a cable (tethered flight): as soon as its function is needed, the aircraft flies from its home (a dedicated hangar on the top of the ship), and becomes a ""virtual pylon"" which elevates a VIS-TIR sensor (Visual Spectrum and Thermal Infrared); captured images are processed in real time by a local computer. Both RPA and hangar are equipped with 2 high accuracy EGNSS receivers (i.e. Galileo ready) in order to provide the relative positioning between the hangar and the RPA hovering on the target. On this context, GNSS represents an essential technology ensuring autonomous operations in a reliable manner guaranteeing provision of distance and bearing from ship to survivors and the protection of the extensible cable against mechanical stress. © 2018 FGM Events LLC.

We see the purpose of this book as informing discussion and decision-making around reconfigurations of maternity care, so that planning, communication, management and recruitment can be improved and shared vision articulated and understood.A” Throughout the world, women-centred care is gaining prominence in providing maternity care. Many birth centres open each year to meet this need - but at the same time, many close or are shelved. So why should the turnover in organisations that deliver such a vital service to women be so high, thwarting many midwives from practising as they would wish? This carefully researched and passionate book tells the story of a birth centre that did fail, and the painful but valuable lessons it presents for others. Many of the issues and behaviours illustrated - lack of leadership, support, vision and plain-dealing, and tensions between bureaucracy and women-centred care - will find resonance in maternity services and midwifery experiences in the UK and throughout the world. Tensions and Barriers in Improving Maternity Care is a vital and challenging resource for all midwives, managers and policy makers and shapers with an interest in maternity and women-centred care. “A remarkably detailed analysis of the politics of a birth centre trapped in a medicalised system that threatened and rapidly destroyed it. It is a vivid example of how autonomous midwifery is undermined by an organisational structure in which management focuses exclusively on one model of care.” - From the Foreword by Sheila Kitzinger ‘I would recommend this powerful book to all supervisors of midwives as it provides profound insights into the impact of loss and grief upon the midwives who are often left feeling isolated and vulnerable when dealing with difficult circumstances.’ - Nessa McHugh, lecturer in midwifery at Edinburgh Napier University, and leader of the Preparation and Practice of Supervisors of Midwives programme. © 2010 Ruth Deery, Deborah Hughes and Mavis Kirkham.","Book","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, a methodology for designing optimal inlet geometries for transonic operation using computational fluid dynamics is proposed. Selected designs are assessed at off-design conditions to quantify the effect of flight Mach number and angle of attack. The performance of the intake is summarized into a map of recovery pressure in function of the operating conditions. The map is integrated into an engine model built using T-MATS, in order to assess the changes in engine consumption at different regimes of the inlet. The paper outlines a procedure for designing high speed engine intakes and characterizes the effects of angle incidence on a chosen optimized geometry in terms of pressure recovery and engine performance. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

A comparison was drawn with the previous algorithmic approach. Historical knowledge from various fields was gathered - from behavioural game theory to constraint definition - and then applied to that analysis. The outcome provided results that stem from non-partisan critical thinking, emphasizing on the fact that automated timetabling systems are open to game-play, if design flaws or discrepant stakeholders' awareness exist. These were identified in the case-study. The necessity for proper validation was highlighted and particular example improvements were suggested to the currently deployed system. Generalization of points learned was carried out to a sensible extent, so that the knowledge cloistered in here can encourage other researchers to consider the behavioural repercussions of their algorithms. © PATAT 2018 Organizing Committee.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Then, a specific radio localization method based on the multiple differential phase-of-arrival (D-PoA) and time-of-arrival (TOA) measures at a 3-axial uniform linear array (3A-ULA) is presented to estimate the positron of an UAV with respect to a reference point. The D-PoA and TOA measures are coupled with a dynamic motion model of the UAV to enable the usage of non-linear Bayesian estimation methods such as the particle filter (PF) and the cuabture Kalman filter (CKF) to improve the positioning accuracy. Furthermore, a comparison in terms of accuracy and complexity of the PF and the CKF for the considered application is presented. To assess the estimation accuracy of these methods, a confined area random aerial trajectory emulator algorithm is used to generate actual paths of the flying UAVs. © 2018 VDE VERLAG GMBH ∙ Berlin ∙ Offenbach","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Both are analyzed using the Maude-NPA cryptographic protocol analyzer. Although previous work has been done applying formal tools to these devices, there has not been any completely automated analysis. This is not surprising, because both YubiKey and YubiHSM, which make use of cryptographic APIs, involve a number of complex features: (i) discrete time in the form of Lamport clocks, (ii) a mutable memory for storing previously seen keys or nonces, (iii) event-based properties that require an analysis of sequences of actions, and (iv) reasoning modulo exclusive-or. Maude-NPA has provided support for exclusive-or for years but has not provided support for the other three features, which we show can also be supported by using constraints on natural numbers, protocol composition and reasoning modulo associativity. In this work, we have been able to automatically prove security properties of YubiKey and find the known attacks on the YubiHSM, in both cases beyond the capabilities of previous work using the Tamarin Prover due to the need of auxiliary user-defined lemmas and limited support for exclusive-or. Tamarin has recently been endowed with exclusive-or and we have rewritten the original specification of YubiHSM in Tamarin to use exclusive-or, confirming that both attacks on YubiHSM can be carried out by this recent version of Tamarin. © 2018, EasyChair.

On one hand, the LoS channels make more cellular base stations (BSs) visible to a UAV as compared to ground users, which leads to a higher macro-diversity gain as compared to the ground users. On the other hand, the LoS channels also render the UAV to generate/receive more severe uplink/downlink interference to/from the BSs, thus requiring more sophisticated inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) techniques with more BSs involved. To draw essential insight, this paper studies the uplink transmission from a UAV to cellular BSs. To mitigate the UAV's interference effect, we aim to maximize the sum-rate of the UAV and all ground users in its resulted ICIC region by jointly optimizing the UAV's cell association, resource block (RB) allocation, and transmit power. We first propose a centralized ICIC design that achieves the optimal performance. As the centralized ICIC requires global information of the network and substantial information exchange among an excessively large number of BSs, we further propose a decentralized ICIC scheme of significantly lower complexity and overhead for implementation. Specifically, we divide the cellular BSs into clusters, each with a dedicated cluster head for collecting information from its cluster BSs and exchanging information with the UAV by exploiting the LoS-induced macro-diversity. Numerical results show that the proposed decentralized ICIC scheme achieves a performance close to the optimal centralized design, and also outperforms the traditional ICIC scheme for cellular networks with terrestrial interference only. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Most existing security testing techniques for DNNs try to find adversarial examples without providing any formal security guarantees about the non-existence of such adversarial examples. Recently, several projects have used different types of Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers to formally check security properties of DNNs. However, all of these approaches are limited by the high overhead caused by the solver. In this paper, we present a new direction for formally checking security properties of DNNs without using SMT solvers. Instead, we leverage interval arithmetic to compute rigorous bounds on the DNN outputs. Our approach, unlike existing solver-based approaches, is easily paral-lelizable. We further present symbolic interval analysis along with several other optimizations to minimize over-estimations of output bounds. We design, implement, and evaluate our approach as part of ReluVal, a system for formally checking security properties of Relu-based DNNs. Our extensive empirical results show that ReluVal outperforms Reluplex, a state-of-the-art solver-based system, by 200 times on average. On a single 8-core machine without GPUs, within 4 hours, ReluVal is able to verify a security property that Reluplex deemed inconclusive due to timeout after running for more than 5 days. Our experiments demonstrate that symbolic interval analysis is a promising new direction towards rigorously analyzing different security properties of DNNs. © 2018 Proceedings of the 27th USENIX Security Symposium.

In this framework, Italy stands out because, despite its bloody history of right-wing political violence and terrorism, it has heretofore avoided, with one notable exception, any fatal lone actor attacks. This article presents a deviant case design: focusing on the exceptional case of Gianluca Casseri, the CasaPound sympathizer who went on a shooting spree in Florence in 2011, it questions theoretical assumptions concerning the non-occurrence of lone-actor terrorism by advancing a general proposition for why terrorists opt to act individually in settings where collective action is the norm. Based on first-hand information from CasaPound militants, and extensive primary data on the radicalization of Casseri, we argue that the choice between autonomous and collective violence is not only a matter of contextual constraints, personality and strategic choice. Rather, it also crucially depends on the degree of embeddedness of an individual in his or her milieu, and on the nature of the radical movement itself. The findings thus contribute to identifying the conditions that make the occurrence of lone-actor terrorism most likely, as well as the circumstances under which existing countervailing forces might fail to impede individual radicalization. © 2018 Terrorism Research Initiative.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we integrate human pilots of semi-autonomous aircraft in the detection, diagnosis, and correction of anomalous aircraft dynamical behavior, without a transfer from autonomous to manual control. In this shared control framework between the human pilot and adaptive autopilot, the human pilot has an active role in anomaly detection and mitigation by taking responsibility for high-level decision-making tasks, while an adaptive autopilot retains the responsibility for low-level regulation and command tracking tasks. Use of the trained human pilot’s perceptive and decision-making capabilities extends the autopilot’s ability to handle anomalous vehicle behavior. A specific application to the lateral-directional dynamics of a fixed-wing aircraft is considered to illustrate the use of this semi-autonomous control framework in response to two types of anomalies, one representing a physical actuator fault and the other a cyber attack on the vehicle’s sensors. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In this study, we propose a novel edge based anomaly detection system, coined VeAnDe, which exploits edge based sensor data fusion to identify the anomaly events. VeAnDe analyzes pair-wise correlations between different intra-vehicle sensors, and utilizes these correlations to examine whether an anomaly has occurred within the vehicle. More specifically, the pair-wise correlations are organized as ring architecture to reduce the computation overhead. Furthermore, the major components of VeAnDe are embedded in edge computing devices, which enables VeAnDe to be more efficient and privacy-preserving. We evaluate the performance of VeAnDe under different scenarios, and our experimental results demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

New interactions increase complexity, resulting in unforeseeable system states and risk fluctuations. Despite the development of approaches that address some of the limitations of current risk management, the sub-systems of the ship are mostly treated separately with only partial consideration of interactions between risk factors. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a novel framework for managing life-cycle risk in the maritime domain, where the ship is viewed as an integrated complex system that is subject to change throughout its life-cycle. The focus is on enhancing the adaptive capability of the system to respond to evolving dynamics and deal with unknown and emerging safety threats. In addition, to avoid potential problem shifting between life-cycle stages, interactions between risk factors and risk propagation are considered. In this context, a change in perspective for maritime safety is also proposed, based on the concept of biomimicry, considering that biological systems typically adapt in a dynamic environment to deal with emerging threats. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

As the popularity and number of sUAV in the airspace increases continuously also increases the risk of a collision between unmanned and manned aircraft. Possible impact scenarios are defined within this paper based on bird strike data. Up to now, there are no relevant data for the collision with a sUAV. But sUAV are similar in size and mass to birds and due to this, bird strike data can be used to determine impact load cases and locations. EASA's suggestion of drone sizes will be adapted for the collision with rotorcrafts. Furthermore, the structure of a drone is described. A drone consists of at least four main parts, the battery, motors, structure and payload. Each of these components represents another threat and these are evaluated on the basis of their risk potential. The FAA penetration equation and further penetration equations are used to describe analytical the threat of a drone strike to a helicopter. The final analytic results are rated by engineering judgement due to uncertainties in the analytic approaches. Based on these results, a test- and simulation program is developed to fully characterize the threat of a drone strike to manned rotorcraft. The main results are that a drone strike poses a greater danger to rotorcraft than to commercial airliners. Impact tests need to be performed to fully characterize the threat and will be done in further research activities. Copyright © 2018 by author(s).","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The term resolution here includes spatial and spectral resolutions. Additionally, at lower altitudes, airplanes and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can deliver very high-resolution data from targeted locations. Remote sensing acquisitions employ both passive (optical and thermal range, multispectral, and hyperspectral) and active devices such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). Diverse information of the Earth’s surface can be obtained from these multiple imaging sources. Optical and SAR characterize the surface of the ground, LiDAR provides the elevation, while multispectral and hyperspectral sensors reveal the material composition. These multisource remote sensing images, once combined/fused together, provide a more comprehensive interpretation of land cover/use (urban and climatic changes), natural disasters (floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes), and potential exploitation (oil fields and minerals). However, automatic interpretation of remote sensing data remains challenging. Two fundamental problems in data fusion of multisource remote sensing images are (1) differences in resolution hamper the ability to fastly interpret multisource remote sensing images and (2) there is no clear methodology yet on combining the diverse information of different data sources.

Also this rapidly developing technology, however, proves to be Janus-faced. Despite their unquestionable benefits, UAS increasingly pose serious safety and security threats. Detection, tracking, and classification of small and highly agile drones, however, is one of the most challenging surveillance tasks. Only a properly designed suite of heterogeneous and mutually complementary sensor provides the required sensor data. On this basis, the key technology proves to advanced multiple sensor data fusion that provides situational awareness and the key information for assigning appropriate counter measures. We in particular focus on a novel approach and highly promising approach which has the potential of a paradigm shift in sensor data fusion: Tensor decomposition based multiple sensor tracking filters. This new methodology for fusion engines is able to efficiently represent the full informational content of advanced sensors and sophisticated dynamic models for drone motion. Powerful multilinear decomposition methods for tensors are drastically reducing the computational efforts for producing high-quality tracks for dim and agile drones. Moreover, the deterministic performance characteristics of tensor decomposition based fusion have beneficial implications for systems design aspects. These advanced algorithms of multiple sensor data fusion play a key role in designing counter drone systems. In the context of C5ISR systems (Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance), the technological challenges can be met, but require close cooperation between the military and police forces, research institutes and the relevant industries.

Most space agencies are now targeting the Moon as the next step in exploration beyond LEO and many already have plans for precursor robotic and human exploration. For example, ESA has championed the â€œMoon Villageâ€ concept since 2016 and NASA's 2018 budget includes a Lunar Exploration Campaign. In this context, natural caves are appealing solutions to shelter humans and equipment for long-duration Lunar missions. In 2017, for example, data from JAXA's Kaguya probe revealed a 50km-long lava tube. For safety reasons, the preliminary robotic exploration of these tubes is imperative. Multi-robot systems carry the potential for greater efficiency and higher fault-tolerance, because of their ability to cooperate and inherent redundancy. Including humans into these systems is desirable to mitigate the complexity of the system but challenging at the interface level. Creating a â€œsymbiotic human and multi-robot planetary exploration systemâ€ requires tackling multiple open research questions at once. First, the coordination of several (semi-)autonomous robots is challenging because of their hard-to-predict collective emerging behaviour. Second, human-robot interaction is a relatively young discipline, even more so for multi-robot systems. Finally, in the context of caves and planetary exploration, ensuring reliable communication is entirely non-trivial. Herein, we describe a software infrastructure which aims to address these problems. We also lay out our plans for its deployment in multiple robotic setups with increasing levels of realism. The goal is to create a semi-autonomous multi-rover system capable of exploring the Moon's surface and lava tubes under an astronaut's in-situ supervision. At the same time, the robots shall also place themselves so that network connectivity is preserved. One additional requirement is the low cognitive load of the human-(multi-)robot interface. The project is a Networking Partnering Initiative between ESA's European Astronaut Centre (EAC) and Polytechnique MontrÃ©al. Its first step is the implementation of the algorithms and protocols required for exploration and connectivity maintenance. All coding exploits Buzz-a multi-robot domain-specific scripting language developed at Polytechnique. Verification is done through simulation using the multi-physics, open-source simulators ARGoS and Gazebo. The mock-up human-(multi-)robot interface is evaluated in a laboratory setup, with real robots-using Polytechnique's fleets of wheeled K-team KheperaIV and Zooids. The system methodology developed in this project will potentially lead to deployment within ESA analogue campaigns and facilities (such as the LUNA facility at EAC).

Thin section analysis of sandstone aims to describe depositional textures, major grain types and granulometric distribution, sedimentary structures, grain sorting, mineral composition, structural features, pore types, porosity, etc. These features are exploited to interpret the sedimentary environments, to predict the distribution of sedimentary bodies and their geometry which determines a recovery factor and other key reservoir exploitation characteristics. To conduct these studies one is to segment thin section images first - to partition them into grains, fractures, cleavages, pores, cement. The segmentation process is time-consuming as it is carried out manually or with specialized software that requires a proper recipe preparation for each image. The segmentation accuracy directly shapes the quality of further petrographic analysis. The goal of work is to develop a fully automatic algorithm for segmentation of thin section images for sandstone and further analysis of partitioned objects. The developed algorithm combines both image processing (IP) and deep learning (DL) approaches. IP methods exploit color intensity and local textural information to segment key structural elements in thin section image: voids (pores and fractures). The combination of DL and IP methods exploit primary information from images to solve semantic and instance segmentation problems for grains and to classify grains, cement and pores. Implementing of DL approaches demands a comprehensive training sample, full enough to have a reasonable segmentation accuracy. Thereby, the dataset of labeled images has been prepared manually. The developed algorithm has been efficiently applied for thin section analysis of sandstone. It has showed not only high agreement with manually processed thin sections and tremendous working time optimization, but more consistent results of segmentation as well. The algorithm plays a role of auxiliary tool that simplifies significantly the petrographic analysis of sandstone: most routine processes are automated; each thin section specimen can be processed statistically in a straightforward manner. © 2018 European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers EAGE.

"Decision-based adversarial attacks: Reliable attacks against black-box machine learning models","2018","6th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2018 - Conference Track Proceedings","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083954048&partnerID=40&md5=d2646cdf5c872ab2eaf5119b5338131f","Many machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to almost imperceptible perturbations of their inputs. So far it was unclear how much risk adversarial perturbations carry for the safety of real-world machine learning applications because most methods used to generate such perturbations rely either on detailed model information (gradient-based attacks) or on confidence scores such as class probabilities (score-based attacks), neither of which are available in most real-world scenarios. In many such cases one currently needs to retreat to transfer-based attacks which rely on cumbersome substitute models, need access to the training data and can be defended against. Here we emphasise the importance of attacks which solely rely on the final model decision. Such decision-based attacks are (1) applicable to real-world black-box models such as autonomous cars, (2) need less knowledge and are easier to apply than transfer-based attacks and (3) are more robust to simple defences than gradient- or score-based attacks. Previous attacks in this category were limited to simple models or simple datasets. Here we introduce the Boundary Attack, a decision-based attack that starts from a large adversarial perturbation and then seeks to reduce the perturbation while staying adversarial. The attack is conceptually simple, requires close to no hyperparameter tuning, does not rely on substitute models and is competitive with the best gradient-based attacks in standard computer vision tasks like ImageNet. We apply the attack on two black-box algorithms from Clarifai.com. The Boundary Attack in particular and the class of decision-based attacks in general open new avenues to study the robustness of machine learning models and raise new questions regarding the safety of deployed machine learning systems. An implementation of the attack is available as part of Foolbox (https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox). © Learning Representations, ICLR 2018 - Conference Track Proceedings.All right reserved.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

On the other hand, an impact of the information technology on the accuracy of decision making processes is significant. In search of a competitive advantage employers have to learn how to profit from a competence of such people. However, digital natives have to be educated in a correct way, in terms of both hard and soft skills. Unfortunately, education programs, also those related to construction management, not always meet the market requirements. Therefore higher education institutions start to answer the challenge and convert their policies and teaching programs into 21st-century-friendly. The paper describes a specificity of the teaching about construction management. It explains modern strategies to attract student’s attention and to provide him/her necessary capabilities useful in a future job. First, articles indexed by the Web of Science database from 1999 to 2017, were examined in order to verify a specificity of higher education as well as main factors conditioning teaching about construction management. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of the new program contents and methodologies used was executed. Then a course model was proposed which provides a reconciliation between traditional and unconventional approaches. Whereas that every change requires preparation, some opportunities and threats were explored. The article refers also to examples of good practice implemented at the UTP University of Science and Technology. Construction management students witness new didactic strategies (blended learning, case studies, site visits, webinars, conferences) as well as learn about innovative solutions useful in construction management: Building Information Modelling (BIM), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) or machine learning. Conclusions of the analysis show that the course model can be useful for implementation in the higher education, especially in construction management. © 2018 EUCEET 2018 - 4th International Conference on Civil Engineering Education: Challenges for the Third Millennium.

Navigation systems usually integrate different proprioceptive sensors to estimate the asset and the speed of the vehicle. In particular, the Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) is fundamental during the navigation to have an accurate estimate of the vehicle’s speed. This work addresses the enhancement of the navigation performance of an AUV through the development of a Deep Water Navigation Filter (DWNF). The DWNF is able to work in those scenarios where traditional navigation sensors show their limits: e.g., deep waters where DVL bottom lock cannot be achieved, or areas where the use of traditionally used static and dedicated beacons is incompatible with the mission requirements. The proposed approach exploits the concept of using a network of vehicles cooperatively supporting each other for their navigation. Several types of measurements coming from the different nodes (i.e. acoustic positioning system such as ship-mounted SSBL acoustic positioning system, USBL, range measurements from the different nodes) are fused in an Extended Kalman Filter framework with the odometry data. DWNF pushes forward the idea of using a network of robotic assets as a provider of navigation services allowing more flexible and robust operations of the deployed system. The approach has been tested at sea during several experiments. We report here results from DWNF running successfully in real-time on the NATO STO-Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) vehicles during the Dynamic Mongoose’17 experimentation off the South coast of Iceland (June-July 2017). © 2018, Institute of Marine Engineering Science & Technology.

In the maritime domain, several embedded sensors continuously report vessel’s positions. Beyond known errors (human, misconfiguration), recent works have shown that falsification of such data is easy, and therefore could mask or favor illegal actions, lead to disturbance of monitoring systems and new maritime risks.

This dualism drives the research community towards the design of monitoring systems able to integrate machine learning methods and data mining techniques in this evolving environment. In this framework, we consider a WiFi based approach aimed at detecting nearby unmanned aerial vehicles, by performing statistical fingerprint analysis on wireless traffic. We study the inherent vulnerabilities of the considered method through real-life experimental tests by setting up specific attack scenarios, and we devise and test a solution in order to improve the efficiency of the proposed technique in the presence of malicious countermeasures.

In fact, many technologies have been using them for years such as credit card fraud predictions and spam detection whilst others are starting to evaluate implementations like autonomous vehicles and different applications in IT security. However, the accuracy of these algorithms has prevailed over its security implication and hence the latter was not a priority when improving this technology. Therefore, adversarial learning is important in general to ensure AI safety because it forces the model to act in unexpected ways, which allows to observe its behavior under worst case input. The goal of researching adversarial machine learning on malware classifiers is not only to predict how a bad actor could cause security issues through malware misclassification but also to generate adversarial samples that can help retrain these models to improve its detection. © IFIP.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Yet, they lack rigorous principles for setting bounty amounts and require high payments to attract economically rational hackers. Rather than claim bounties for serious bugs, hackers often sell or exploit them. We present the Hydra Framework, the first general, principled approach to modeling and administering bug bounties that incentivize bug disclosure. Our key idea is an exploit gap, a program transformation that enables runtime detection, and rewarding, of critical bugs. Our framework transforms programs via N-of-N-version programming, a variant of classical N-version programming that runs multiple independent program instances. We apply the Hydra Framework to smart contracts, small programs that execute on blockchains. We show how Hydra contracts greatly amplify the power of bounties to incentivize bug disclosure by economically rational adversaries, establishing the first framework for rigorous economic evaluation of smart contract security. We also model powerful adversaries capable of bug withholding, exploiting race conditions in blockchains to claim bounties before honest users can. We present Submarine Commitments, a countermeasure of independent interest that conceals transactions on blockchains. We design a simple, automated version of the Hydra Framework for Ethereum (ethereum.org) and implement two Hydra contracts, an ERC20 standard token and a Monty-Hall game. We evaluate our implementation for completeness and soundness with the official Ethereum Virtual Machine test suite and live blockchain data. © 2018 Proceedings of the 27th USENIX Security Symposium.

Many critical waterways in the world are becoming more crowded due to many factors in waterway environments, such as invisibility, variability, and uncertainty. Accurate water depth information is necessary to improve navigation safety. Water depth information of electronic charts cannot be updated in a timely way, while the actual water depth is unpredictable, and this factor threatens the safety of vessels in waterway environments. Based on the shore-based network, ship navigation data and other big data can be integrated to vessels navigation environments in real time. In this paper, we present a new scheme to quickly and accurately construct a vessel safety navigation depth reference map, which contains appropriate channel water depth information. This effective scheme is based on automated identification system (AIS) data and increases the travel safety through crowded waterways. AIS data include rich maritime traffic information. Both the static and the dynamic information about vessels through waterways can be extracted and processed from big real-time AIS data. Based on extensive actual experiments, we apply data mining techniques to extract the waterway depth information both draft-depth and vessel trajectories based on AIS data. The data are collected from vessels in both locations: 1) the Nantong port, in Jiangsu Province, China and 2) Meizhou Bay waterway, in Fujian Province, China. The Hermite interpolation scheme is used to patch the trajectories of vessels, and the BP neural network model is introduced to predict the maximum vessel draft. Clustering and data fusion methods are employed to construct a vessel safety navigation depth reference map according to the cluster area of vessel trajectories and draft information. The experimental results demonstrate that the vessel safety navigation depth reference map accurately reflects the current water depth profile of channels. This paper can provide accurate and timely channel water-depth information for the vessel navigation and the maritime supervision. The proposed scheme in this paper can also provide reference for trajectory data processing and mining. © 2018 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The relentless pursuit of new military technologies by States continues to yield expanding lists of technology-related issues for lawyers to consider in applying the law of armed conflict in complex battlespaces on land, on sea, in air, in space, and in cyberspace. Foremost among these issues is the challenge presented by the principle of proportionality, requiring military forces to refrain from causing excessive damage to civilians and civilian objects when attacking military objectives. New weapons systems in complex battlespaces continue to increasingly force lawyers and decision makers to revisit, re-evaluate, and struggle in new contexts with the “equitable balance between humanitarian requirements and the sad necessities of war.” Some technological developments may, however, also present opportunities for the principle of proportionality to achieve greater relevance to the conduct of armed conflicts and even contribute to improved compliance by States. To illustrate these challenges and opportunities, this chapter examines the application of the principle of proportionality in modern armed conflicts with respect to several critical yet still evolving military technologies: unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous weapons systems, cyber capabilities, and outer space technologies. © Oxford University Press 2019.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

It can be traced back to the evolution of the human species and the shift from nomadic to sedentary societies. Along with technological progress, society development, urban growth and other factors, new challenges were placed on walls. Today, walls are used for protection against environmental risk rather than robberies or military troops. In the paper the basic typology of walls – the one of territorial protection against external threats and the other of keeping a population within a certain perimeter – are illustrated with the examples of the Great Wall of China and the Berlin Wall. In terms of their defensive/over-protecting aspect, these are counterbalanced with the example of the Green Wall. All three, however, share the property of being able of affecting both local societies and large population as well as defining their surroundings in both local and territorial scale. The paper describes the development of walls as autonomous architectural structures rather than a mere architectural element. It provides a wider perspective on contemporary condition of the very concept of wall as well as their possible future. It is worth emphasising, that in the context of modern democratic country, the latter may be rooted in the absence rather than the presence. © 2018, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

This enables plug and play sensor integration and autonomous fusion, including prediction of the trajectory of the vehicle for sensor cueing, multi-modal sensor fusion and target hand-off. The SAPIENT Counter-UAS (C-UAS) system was successfully demonstrated in a live trial against a range of UAS targets flown in a variety of attack trajectories, using radar and Electro-Optic (EO) C-UAS ASMs. In addition, the trial also demonstrated the use of synthetic sensors, on their own and in combination with real sensors. Outputs of all the available sensors were tracked and fused by the Cubica SAPIENT HLDMM which then steered narrow field-of-view cameras onto the predicted 3D position of the UAS. The operator was provided with a map-based view showing alerts and tracks to provide situational awareness, together with snapshots from the EO sensor and video feeds from the steerable narrow field of view cameras.

In these circumstances, the overwhelming number of engagements are against identified hostile forces. In many non-international armed conflicts, however, combatants actively attempt to camouflage their status, and U.S. forces find themselves engaging enemy forces under a self-defense framework. This creates problems. Consider, for example, a situation where three individuals of unknown affiliation launch an attack against a U.S. military convoy in Afghanistan. After a short engagement, the attackers get in a van and speed away from the attack site. The U.S. convoy is disabled, but an unmanned aerial vehicle tracks the van as it retreats into the desert. Thirty minutes later an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter arrives on scene above the still-retreating van. Can the Apache attack the vehicle? The van is retreating and poses no threat, thus self-defense principles would not allow for the use of force, despite the fact that the occupants are clearly directly participating in hostilities. This chapter addresses three questions: Why are the SROE drafted in this manner? What is the basis in the law for the SROE’s approach to self-defense? What are the problems presented by this approach?. © Oxford University Press 2019.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

The turbine output power is stored either in electric batteries or is fed into electrolysers to produce hydrogen which is compressed and stored in tanks.

"High accuracy positioning engine with an integrity layer for safety autonomous vehicles","2018","Proceedings of the 31st International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2018","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063015117&partnerID=40&md5=06a5d088fb2e5daf1a0151e887be7afc","Autonomous vehicles are becoming a reality. One of the most critical functions of an autonomous vehicle is to be able to obtain an accurate and reliable estimation of the position and attitude of the vehicle. This is even more critical when operating without human supervision as for the SAE Level 4. This paper presents an innovative positioning engine capable of providing highly accurate real-time position and attitude estimates along with an integrity layer consisting of Protection Levels (PL), which bound the error of each estimated value with a certain confidence level. The position and attitude estimated by the engine are based on the measurements provided by an intelligent off-the shelf automotive camera, a mass market dual-frequency GNSS receiver, low-cost inertial sensors, vehicle odometry and lane-level navigation maps. Highly accurate positions are computed by means of a real time PPP hybrid algorithm that employs dual-frequency GPS and Galileo measurements, inertial sensors and PPP corrections obtained from a web server when the connection is available through the cellular network. Another robust hybrid standard positioning algorithm runs in parallel allowing consistency checks. Last but not least, the automotive intelligent camera provides lateral distance measurements to the road lane marks which are employed to improve the accuracy by means of the lane-level accurate maps and also to provide an accurate position relative to the map. The position and attitude values provided by the engine (including the position computed relative to the map) are complemented with the estimation of the associated integrity Protection Levels (PL), computed for multiple target integrity risks. The implementation of an integrity layer is crucial since in safety-critical applications it can be more important to know whether the information is reliable than the precise information itself. This integrity layer determines the degree of usability of the location and attitude estimations, which is used as part of autonomous vehicle architecture to ensure that the vehicle operates safely. This engine has been developed within the ESCAPE project ([1]) and is being integrated and tested with an autonomous car. ESCAPE (European Safety Critical Applications Positioning Engine) is a project co-funded under the Fundamental Elements program of the European GNSS Agency (GSA). It started on October 2016 with a duration of 3 years and with the main objective of developing a localisation system that provides the vehicle position and attitude estimations to be employed in safety critical applications like Autonomous Driving (AD) or Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). The project is led by the Spanish company FICOSA in collaboration with partners from across Europe: Renault, IFSSTAR and the University of Technology of Compiègne from France, STMicroelectronics and Instituto Superiore Mario Boella from Italy and GMV from Spain. ESCAPE enables a high-grade of data fusion (GNSS, inertial sensors, cameras and vehicle sensors) and the exploitation of several key technological differentiators such as the precise point positioning service (PPP), the potential use of the Galileo signal authentication and the provision of an integrity layer to assess the degree of trust one can associate to the position information provided by the device. Therefore, the three key pillars of the ESCAPE positioning engine are: ▪ The smart exploitation of different localization data sources to provide a highly accurate navigation solution, including GPS and Galileo dual-frequency measurements, intelligent cameras providing lateral distance to road lane-marks, inertial measurement units, vehicle odometry, PPP corrections and high definition maps; ▪ The unique provision of real-time integrity protection levels associated to the location estimates, which express the “degree of usability” of the positioning information for safety-critical applications. The PLs associated to the positions computed relative to the map are fundamental for autonomous driving applications; ▪ The full integration of the ESCAPE engine into a vehicle with autonomous driving capabilities, and its test on several different reference paths and environmental conditions. The innovative ESCAPE GNSS Engine (EGE) is close-to-market, its components are organized in a modular architecture and has safety at its core as its specification and design are based on the ISO 26262 recommendations ([2]). The EGE includes the following main components: ▪ GNSS receiver chipset: an automotive-grade multiband and multi-constellation GNSS receiver. ▪ Inertial Measurements Unit (IMU) ▪ Communication peripherals needed for the communications of the board with the vehicle and with the cellular network. ▪ Main processor running the EGE algorithms: - GNSS+Sensors Positioning&Integrity algorithm, where GNSS measurements are integrated with those provided by an inertial measurement unit (IMU) in order to provide a GNSS pose with integrity. - Camera-based Positioning&Integrity algorithm. The accurate maps containing road lane-marks along with the intelligent camera measurements allow a second positioning service with accuracies that can reach a few centimeters in the cross direction, thus complementing and enhancing the positions provided by the GNSS+Sensors Positioning&Integrity algorithm. (Figure presented.) The paper includes a description of the engine architecture and the design of the algorithms along with the algorithm performance results obtained with real data under different environments (performances are assessed in three different operating conditions associated to open-sky, sub-urban and deep urban environments). © 2018 Institute of Navigation.

It can be large enough to carry a matrix of high resolution cameras and a rack of high performance computing images processing and exploitation units (PEU). The majority of the small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAV) are able to carry optics payloads, allowing them to take aerial images from strategic viewpoints. This capability constitutes a key enabler for an immense number of applications, such as crowd monitoring, search and rescue, surveillance scenario, industrial inspection and so on. The constrained onboard processing power in addition to the strict limit in the flying time of sUAV are amongst the serious challenges that have to be overcome to enable a cost effective persistent surveillance based on sUAV platforms. In this paper, we conduct a feasibility study for developing a potential sUAV based persistent surveillance system with tethered power supply. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

As part of that effort, the feasibility and advantages of modal predictive control (MPC) based guidance and control algorithms capable of extracting energy from updrafts have already been demonstrated numerically. However, given the nature of the dominant phenomena, a nonlinear optimal control problem results. Since it may be of large order, implementation and real-time operation difficulties may arise. Knowing that, an alternative MPC-based ATS controller designed to yield a simple and small nonlinear programming problem to be solved online is presented herein. In order to accomplish that, linear prediction schemes are employed to impose the differential constraints, thus no extra variables are added to the problem and only linear bound restrictions result. For capturing the governing nonlinear effects during the climb phase, a simplified representation of the aircraft kinematics with quasi-steady corrections is used by the controller internal model. Simulation results using a 3 degree-of-freedom model subjected to a randomly generated time varying thermal environment show that the aircraft is able to locate and exploit updrafts, suggesting that the proposed algorithm is a feasible MPC strategy. © 31st Congress of the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences, ICAS 2018.

It takes the diagnosis descriptions (DDs) of a patient as inputs and selects the most relevant ICD codes. This architecture contains four major ingredients: (1) tree-of-sequences LSTM encoding of code descriptions (CDs), (2) adversarial learning for reconciling the different writing styles of DDs and CDs, (3) isotonic constraints for incorporating the importance order among the assigned codes, and (4) attentional matching for performing many-to-one and one-to-many mappings from DDs to CDs.

Recently, Kumari et al. have discussed a user anonymous authentication scheme that uses common storage device such as USB stick, mobile phone, etc. rather than using a smart card. The common storage device is used to store some authentication information issued by the server. We cryptanalyze the Kumari et al.'s scheme and find that it is not resistant to the device stolen, privileged insider and denial of service attacks. In this paper, we propose a user authentication scheme based on public key cryptography to overcome its drawbacks. We show its formal security analysis using random oracle model and discuss its informal security analysis to show that it is resistant to the various known attacks. We simulate it using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool for its formal security verification.

In many cases, the UAVs have cameras mounted onboard for other applications, and these cameras can be used as bearing-only sensors to estimate the relative orientation of another UAV. The idea is to exploit the redundant information provided by these sensors onboard each of the UAVs to increase safety and reliability, detecting faults on UAV internal sensors that cannot be detected by the UAVs themselves. Fault detection is based on the generation of residuals which compare the expected position of a UAV, considered as target, with the measurements taken by one or more UAVs acting as observers that are tracking the target UAV with their cameras. Depending on the available number of observers and the way they are used, a set of strategies and policies for fault detection are defined. When the target UAV is being visually tracked by two or more observers, it is possible to obtain an estimation of its 3D position that could replace damaged sensors. Accuracy and reliability of this vision-based cooperative virtual sensor (CVS) have been evaluated experimentally in a multivehicle indoor testbed with quadrotors, injecting faults on data to validate the proposed fault detection methods. © 2018 Alejandro Suarez et al.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Since unveiling one’s own strategy to the adversaries is not desirable, this requires each player to independently predict the other players’ future actions. Nash equilibria are a powerful tool to model this and similar multi-agent coordination problems in which the absence of communication impedes full coordination between the agents. In this paper, we propose a novel receding horizon planning algorithm that, exploiting sensitivity analysis within an iterated best response computational scheme, can approximate Nash equilibria in real time.

In the present work, lane detection is implemented using FPGA for day vision. This necessitates utilization of image processing techniques like filtering, edge detection and thresholding. The lane detection is performed by firstly capturing the image from a video camera and converted to gray scale. Then, a noise filtering process for gray image is performed using Gaussian and average filter. Methods from first and second order edge detection techniques have been selected for the purpose of lane edge detection. The effect of manually changing the threshold level on image enhancement has been examined. The results showed that raising threshold level would better enhance the image.

So, a proficient mobile application approach is projected in this paper that may predict the possibilities of a attack once an individual is bearing the noticeable symptoms of chest pain. Random forest predicts the result of the user input features and the automated result is shown on the smartphone application. The application categorizes the prediction of the user's input as a heart attack, maybe heart attack and no heart attack. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the proposed technique is 92%, whereas the precision is 95%, 92%, 87% respectively for heart attack, maybe heart attack and no heart attack prediction. Our research target is to raise heart attack awareness on time in an innovative way through available and accessible medium to mass people. © 2018 Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems.

"Outpatient housing instead of nursing home - Long-term rehabilitation options for persons with acquired brain injury; [Ambulante Wohnform statt Pflegeheim - Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten bei Personen mit erworbenen Hirnschädigungen in der Langzeitrehabilitation]","2018","Neurologie und Rehabilitation","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061098365&partnerID=40&md5=88bd81cf2c2d2261e65fd2634b9524f5","Background: Due to advances in acute care medicine, survival rates from acquired brain injury are increasing. Some of the patients have to live with considerable limitations. Standard inpatient rehabilitation is often not long and/or comprehensive enough to ensure that the most severely affected patients can fully exploit their rehabilitation potential. In particular, for younger persons this may lead to a premature transfer to a care home setting. The P.A.N. Zentrum für Post-Akute Neurorehabilitation applies a holistic concept to prepare patients for, and help them through, the transition to an autonomous and independent life in an assisted-living setting. How many patients succeed in taking this step is the subject of this study. Methods: The rehabilitation concept encompasses the whole 24-hour cycle. 12.5 hours are dedicated to medical and neuropsychological interventions, while the remaining time is devoted to activities that promote social participation and engagement. Outcome parameters comprise the relative change between the pre-incident and post-rehabilitation living arrangement. Quantitative data was obtained using the Frühreha Barthel Index (FRB) and the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (MPAI), recorded at the beginning and at the end of the inpatient rehabilitation period. Results: Fifty-four patients with a mean age of 44 years participated in the study. The length of stay was 15.61 ± 8.08 months (M ± SD). In total, over 90 % of rehabilitants were able to avoid going to to a nursing home. 66.67 % were discharged into a setting with moderate support and 9.26 % into a form of living with increased support. Care measures were furthermore the main focus for 24.07 % of the patients, of which only 9.26 % had to move into a nursing home. FRB values were significantly higher after the rehabilitation: move-in = 31.30/move-out = 50.28 (M). Based on the MPAI, there were significant improvements: ability (p = .018) and participation (p = .018) subscales, as well as the total score (p = .017). No significant change was observed for the subscale adjustment. Conclusion: Even in patients with an acquired brain injury with severe limitations, targeted long-term rehabilitation can help them transition to an independent living setting within the community. This is a basic requirement for a participatory and autonomous life. © Hippocampus Verlag 2018.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"DRIFT: Drone-rover integrated fire tracker system","2018","77th SAWE International Conference on Mass Properties Engineering 2018","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060929358&partnerID=40&md5=d72967492e48b0e72e18587def004767","Wildfire reconnaissance and mitigation efforts are a primary concern for the United States Department of the Interior and National Forest Service. The critical consequences of climate change are becoming more prevalent with longer fire seasons throughout the Western United States [1]. The fire seasons are characterized by hotter and drier conditions, allowing for a wildfire to easily start and rapidly spread with the potential to burn millions of acres and cause billions of dollars in property loss. The National Forest Service (NFS) predicts that it will spend over half of its budget in the fight against wildfires within the next decade [2]. Wildfires can have devastating impacts on communities, ecosystems and wildlife, but also pose a dangerous threat to the fire fighters responsible for their mitigation and containment. A Mother Rover-Child Drone Firetracker System will assist firefighters by traveling to locations at risk of wildfire and gather environmental data which it then transmits back to the designated ground station. This provides information on a fire's intensity, severity, and extent while firefighters remain a safe distance away from the threat. Team DRIFT is a group of eleven undergraduate Aerospace Engineering Sciences students at the University of Colorado Boulder currently developing the Mother-Rover for the Firetracker System with the purpose to secure and carry the Child Drone (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) to a desired location of interest. The development of this Mother-Rover involves integrating the hardware and software of the already completed Child Drone and Landing Platform. The Mother Rover, approximately 46.3 by 58.9 inches, weighing 450 lbs and driven by a remote operator, is capable of traversing rough terrain, defined by small gravel, fine dirt, and slopes up to 20 degrees. Due to the image recognition system utilized on the landing platform for the autonomous landing of the Child Drone, the landing platform must be level to within 3.5 degrees in order for the child drone to safely take off and land. Therefore, the Mother Rover utilizes an internal leveling jack system to level in the landing platform to within 3.5 degrees if the child drone is to be deployed on a slope. The considerable weight of the Mother Rover presents a unique engineering challenge as it must be capable of traversing over the defined rough terrain while also maintaining the security of the onboard Child Drone. The design solution for this Mother Rover and associated leveling system will be discussed in this paper. © 77th SAWE International Conference on Mass Properties Engineering 2018.

However, open challenges in the autonomous navigation and guidance remain if the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) can not be employed because the reception of the signals is denied or unreliable. This often happens in cluttered natural environments, such as gorges and steep valleys, or near to tall civil engineering structures such as dams and bridges. In these cases, the position fix is intermittent, can be biased because of multi-path effects, and the change of the constellation of visible satellites can cause sudden, undesirable shifts in the position solution. In this work we propose a method to solve the position control of an UAV in such scenarios, exploiting the fact that open sky is available above the object of interest. The system is composed of two UAVs: the first one flies higher in the open sky, where an optimal GNSS constellation is available. The second one performs the close range inspection without relying on any GNSS receiver. Instead, its position is determined by the first one by optical tracking and it is sent to the second one in real-time and with low latency to close the position control loops. We present a detailed description of the system and discuss its first experimental evaluation. © 2018 Institute of Navigation. All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

One of the factors that can contribute to a change in the existing situation is the optimization of primary endocrinology care to the population through outpatient visit formalization. Objective - to develop a method to improve the efficiency of outpatient care to patients with DM through formalization of an outpatient visit to the endocrinologist. Material and methods. An improved formalized protocol for a diabetic outpatient visit to the endocrinologist was developed at the outpatient stage and tested in clinical practice, which fully meets the requirements of health authorities for an entry in the «Outpatient Medical Card» (025/y) and the current standards for diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Results. Long-term clinical trials conducted directly at a polyclinic visit to Samara healthcare facilities (more than 5000 formalized outpatient visit protocols were filled out) confirmed that this form allowed one to cover most of the clinical situations that a physician may face when seeing the outpatient. Using this form ensures the complete collection of complaints and objective data, which reduces the likelihood of inaccuracies in diagnosis and in a follow-up and treatment program. Conclusion. Formalizing an outpatient visit to the endocrinologist in addition to minimizing the work time spent on a diary, and increasing the comprehension of an outpatient card entry make it possible to lay the foundation for an automated workplace for an outpatient endocrinologist with a view to its further use as a software module to collect relevant medical data in the regional integrated electronic medical card of a patient. © 2018, Media Sphera Publishing Group.

In this study, welfare measures associated with the use of autonomous taxis were estimated by conducting discrete choice experiments (DCEs) in New York City. Aiming at more realistic choice scenarios, a method for pivot-efficient designs is proposed and tested that exploits the distribution of attribute levels; however, analysis suggests the use of a simpler pivot-efficient design with average attributes of reference alternatives. In our sample New Yorkers were willing to pay on average $3 less per self-driven trip. This reduction in the willingness to pay is coming from the fact that in current conditions not having a driver may be perceived as a nuisance rather than a convenience. © 2018 The Authors.

Along with the prevalence of deep learning, it has been revealed that DNNs are vulnerable to attacks. By deliberately crafting adversarial examples, an adversary can manipulate a DNN to generate incorrect outputs, which may lead catastrophic consequences in applications such as disease diagnosis and self-driving cars. In this paper, we propose an effective method to detect adversarial examples in image classification. Our key insight is that adversarial examples are usually sensitive to certain image transformation operations such as rotation and shifting. In contrast, a normal image is generally immune to such operations. We implement this idea of image transformation and evaluate its performance in oblivious attacks. Our experiments with two datasets show that our technique can detect nearly 99% of adversarial examples generated by the state-of-the-art algorithm. In addition to oblivious attacks, we consider the case of white-box attacks. We propose to introduce randomness in the process of image transformation, which can achieve a detection ratio of around 70%.

Also in the area of commercial vehicles, the automation process makes progress improving for example the transportation efficiency. But most research focuses on on-road scenarios. While these scenes are highly structured and most environmental conditions can be foreseen, the perception, interpretation and forecast in unstructured off-road environments makes the safe and efficient automation of vehicles much more difficult. This paper presents an approach for supportive low-level control of vehicles in rough terrain exploiting the behavior-based control paradigm. Important safety features like collision avoidance are implemented using interacting behaviors with dynamic priorities adapting to the current environmental conditions and system state. The flexibility and effectiveness of the presented approach is shown in simulation and real world scenarios using different kinds of vehicles as a GatorX855D off-road vehicle, Unimog U5023 special truck, and BOMAG tandem rollers. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

They must evolve in an unpredictable environment and a wide context of dynamic execution, with strong interactions. In order to generate the safety of the autonomous vehicle, its occupants and the others road users, it is necessary to validate the decisions of the algorithms for all the situations that will be met. These situations are described and generated as different use cases of automated vehicles. In this work, we propose an approach to generate automatically use cases of autonomous vehicle for highway. This approach is based on a three layers hierarchy, which exploits static and mobile concepts we have defined in the context of three ontologies: highway, weather and vehicle. The highway ontology and the weather ontology conceptualize the environment in which evolves the autonomous vehicle, and the vehicle ontology consists of the vehicle devices and the control actions. To apply our approach, we consider a running example about the insertion of a vehicle by the right entrance lane of a highway. Copyright 2018 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

The RL is exposed to various destabilizing factors, which results in signal distortion, possibly ensued by the train/cab signals switching to a full-stop signal, which entails an unplanned train stop. Therefore, shall the normal operation of railway automation systems be disrupted, it compromises traffic safety and causes train delays and schedule disruptions. Fail-safe operation necessitates timely detection of pre-failures before they may affect the equipment. The transmitted information can be distorted due to the asymmetry of currents in the rail line caused by various factors as well as due to the exposure to electromagnetic interference caused by the traction cars, non-traction power users, and power transmission lines. It is proposed to assess the asymmetry using the spectral analysis of the signal received by the rail circuit equipment from the secondary winding of the impedance bond, which analysis applies fast Fourier transform. Distortions caused by other factors are evaluated by analyzing the track receiver input. Spectral analysis output is processed by special algorithms that maximize the detection of distortions in the received signals. In order to detect pre-failures, spectral analysis is coupled with a programmed mathematical model to detect distortions in recurrent signals. Pre-failures are identified by the Decision Support System (DSS) integrated in the troubleshooting system of the rail automation devices. The use of DSS helps make decisions based on analysis of data produced by various signalprocessing methods, which improves the reliability of detecting pre-failures, their causes, and threats they pose to the affected equipment. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Automatic recognition of suspicious activities can augment human operators to find relevant threats. Common solutions for behavior analysis or action recognition require large amounts of training data. However, suspicious activities and threats are rare events, and the modus operandi of enemies may suddenly change, which makes it unrealistic to obtain sufficient training data in realistic situations. Therefore, we developed a demonstrator for the recognition of suspicious activity that allows users to easily define new alerts based on their expert knowledge. We developed basic modules for the computation of object detections, tracking and action recognition to generate features. The user is able to specify complex behavior with Symbols and Sentences. Symbols are low-level descriptions to analyze combinations of features. An example of a symbol is 'approach-gate', which consists of three conditions related to: The distance to the gate, the speed of a person and whether a person is on the compound. Sentences are high-level descriptions to analyze temporal ordering. An example of a sentence with temporal ordering is 'entering the compound', which consists of first approaching the gate, then entering the gate, and finally being on the compound. The demonstrator is compliant with the SAPIENT architecture, which uses multiple low-level Autonomous Sensor Modules (ASM) and a High-Level Decision Making Module (HLDMM). Features and symbols are computed in an ASM and sentences are computed in the HLDMM. Our demonstrator is tested on a multi-camera dataset to recognize suspicious behavior (e.g., digging for placement of improvised explosive devices, climbing over a fence, approaching the compound, and car standing on the road), allowing the user to interactively creates and modifies both symbols and sentences to mitigate new threats that were not implemented during design time. © 2018 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The rise of smart transportation services and recent break-throughs in autonomous vehicles increase our reliance on trajectory data in a wide variety of applications. Supporting these services in emerging platforms requires more efficient query processing in trajectory databases. In this paper, we propose two new coverage queries for trajectory databases: (i) k Best Facility Trajectory Search (kBFT); and (ii) k Best Coverage Facility Trajectory Search (kBCovFT). We propose a novel index structure, the Trajectory Quadtree (TQtree) that utilizes a quadtree to hierarchically organize trajectories into different nodes, and then applies a z-ordering to further organize the trajectories by spatial locality inside each node. This structure is highly effective in pruning the trajectory search space, which is of independent interest. By exploiting the TQ-tree, we develop a divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently process a kBFT query. To solve the kBCovFT, which is a non-submodular NP-hard problem, we propose a greedy approximation. We evaluate our algorithms through an extensive experimental study on several real datasets, and demonstrate that our algorithms outperform baselines by two to three orders of magnitude. © 2018 VLDB Endowment 21508097/18/07.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The design strives to attack and suppress fires that occur in high rise structures at heights greater than can be reached by ladder truck. The design also strives to deliver a payload of disaster relief supplies to affected areas, reducing risk to ground transport efforts. The study outlines the design and optimization of design components utilizing SolidWorks and testing of these components using SolidWorks Simulation and Flow Simulation packages. This study details the development of the final propeller and frame design, and the range of tests performed within SolidWorks to ensure the design can perform to the required standards. Given the dimensional advantages and torque cancellation capabilities a coaxial octocopter frame is developed. In designing and testing a propeller the proposed design is capable of producing a maximum thrust of 118 lbf. with a minimum factor of safety of 2.238. The propeller spacings are optimized to produce maximum thrust in both the coaxial and in-plane directions which are 23.6 inches and 25.6 inches respectively. For urban firefighting the selected hose and nozzle combination are capable of supplying 60 GPM of water at a height of 150 ft. from the ground. At this loading the minimum factors of safety of the frame and propeller are determined to be 2.238 and 3.034 respectively. The corresponding fatigue lives under prescribed number of cycles are determined to be infinite for both frame and propeller. Using rotorcraft theory, the theoretical hover time that the UAV can maintain in firefighting is determined to be 1.7 hours. Using a combination of SolidWorks Flow Simulation and aerodynamics theory the maximum velocity of the UAV at a pitch of 30 degrees from vertical, hauling a box with dimensions capable of carrying 200 lbs. of relief goods, is determined to be 85 mph. At disaster relief payload capacity the designed frame and propeller are capable of maintaining factors of safety of 3.226 and 3.034 respectively. These factors of safety correlate to fatigue lives of the frame and propeller of 15.98 years and 19.12 years respectively, under prescribed loading. The theoretical flight time the UAV can maintain for disaster relief is determined to be 1.618 hours. This study provides optimized propeller and frame designs along with selections of engines and other important components for building a multipurpose UAV.

This complex task requires a large and varied array of sensors as well as algorithms to exploit their measurements. A major component of this is absolute positioning. Two technologies in particular are heavily relied upon to deliver the absolute position: GNSS and inertial sensors. Current production vehicles already contain both GNSS and inertial sensors, but these are used (and are therefore specified) for functions such as infotainment and stability control. Performance needed for these functions is significantly below what is required for safe lane-level navigation. This means the current sensors, and therefore positioning capabilities, are unable to satisfy the more rigorous requirements needed for autonomy. Future vehicles will need to include more advanced versions of both sensors, along with corrections and advanced fusion techniques, all at a cost level that remains amenable to mass-production. This is a significant challenge facing mass market autonomous driving. There are already many autonomous test vehicles on the roadways, though these provide mostly level 4 autonomy or lower [1], meaning they still require a human driver to be present and operate only in certain conditions. Additionally, these test vehicles are typically using sensors which are larger and more expensive than what is acceptable for mass production. The task of these test vehicles is to prove, and gain public acceptance of, the technology while mass marketable versions are developed. This paper focuses on the absolute positioning component using GNSS and INS technologies. Specifically on the inertial fusion using currently achievable performance using mass market sensors. A companion paper: “Precise Positioning for Automotive with Mass Market GNSS Receivers,” [2] focuses on GNSS capabilities. The synergy between GNSS and INS has been well documented and is now widely used in growing industries such as mobile mapping. Noise inherent in GNSS positions can be smoothed by the continuous INS solution and at the same time, low frequency inertial errors are controlled by the GNSS. However, when GNSS is unavailable, the INS errors grow rapidly when unconstrained. The speed at which the INS errors grow is much larger when using lower-performance mass market sensors, making the task of mitigating these conditions more difficult for the fusion solution. Clear trends can be seen in the results showing that the type of sensor has a significant impact on overall accuracy, but so too does the fusion technology used. The effects of this are apparent though modest in the suburban highway scenario, but are much larger in the more difficult urban canyon scenario. To evaluate the achievable performance combining mass market sensors and NovAtel’s SPAN inertial fusion technology, live data was collected and analyzed. These datasets were collected using different IMUs in two major scenarios; suburban highway and urban canyon. Additionally, a simplified loosely coupled inertial filter was run on the same data to evaluate the effect of the fusion algorithms on the resultant solution as final system performance depends on both the sensors and the integration. Results are compared against a post-processed solution using a survey grade dual frequency receiver paired with a navigation grade inertial measurement unit (IMU). Percentage of solutions with accuracy under the target of “lane level” positioning will be examined in each environment. It is clear in the results that autonomous highway driving can be very nearly achieved with GNSS and INS sensors alone, even with mass market sensors, when the right fusion technology is used. But in urban canyons, where GNSS satellites are often obstructed, or only visible via reflection, this is not the case. While sophisticated fusion technologies offer vast improvements, more development and likely more sensors will be required to meet the required accuracies at the extremely high confidence levels required for autonomy. © 2018 Institute of Navigation.

"The use of bearing measurements for detecting GNSS spoofing","2018","Proceedings of the 31st International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2018","10.33012/2018.16011","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063004263&doi=10.33012%2f2018.16011&partnerID=40&md5=bcf9c5e4548d121ee85d74ab7287ae9b","GNSS are well known to be accurate providers of position information across the globe. Because of high signal availabilities, robust receivers, and well-populated constellations, operators typically believe that the location information provided by their GNSS receiver is correct. More sophisticated users are concerned with the integrity of the derived location information; for example, employ RAIM algorithms to address possible satellite failure modes. The most common attacks on GNSS availability and integrity are known as jamming and spoofing. Jamming involves the transmission of signals that interfere with GNSS reception so that the receiver is unable to provide a position or time solution. Various methods to detect jamming, and possibly overcome it, have been considered in the literature. Spoofing is the transmission of counterfeit GNSS signals so as to mislead a GNSS receiver into reporting an inaccurate position or time. If undetected, spoofing might be much more dangerous than a jamming attack. A typical maritime concern is a spoofer convincing a tanker traveling up a channel to a harbor that it is off track of the channel. A variety of approaches have been proposed in the literature to recognize spoofing; many of these are based on the RF signal alone as, in some sense, they are the simplest to implement. Of interest here are methods which compare GNSS information to measurements available from other, non-GNSS sensors. Examined examples include IMUs, radars, and ranges/pseudoranges from non-GNSS signals. In all cases the data from these others sensors is compared to the position information from the GNSS receiver to assess its integrity. Triangulation of position from bearing measurements is a well-known localization technique, especially for the mariner. This paper considers the use of bearing information to detect GNSS spoofing in a 2-D environment. A typical marine application is a ship entering a harbor and using an alidade to sight landmarks; for mobile, autonomous vehicles the sensor might be a camera taking a bearing to a nearby vehicle or to a signpost. This paper presents a mathematical formulation of the problem and the sensor data, develops a statistical model of the measurements relative to the GNSS position output, constructs a generalized likelihood ratio test detection algorithm based on the Neyman-Pearson performance criterion (maximizing probability of detection while bounding the probability of false alarm), and examines performance of the test, both through analysis and experimentation. A comparison to using both range and bearing is included to show the utility and limitations of bearing data to spoof detection. © 2018 Institute of Navigation.

However, the use of wireless communication exposes individual vehicles to cyber-attacks that aim at disrupting the platoon.

Improvement potentials in picking up, placing down and optimizing the demonstrated path are identified and technical solutions to these areas are presented. The task of picking up the part is improved through the use of null space motion of the robot and exploiting part symmetry. The task of placing down parts is improved through increasing precision by using data collected during the demonstration. Finally the path of the robot is optimized using automated reinforcement learning by applying reward-weighted averaging.

The objective of this paper is to investigate in detail the utility of parallel computing in geocomputational modeling. We discuss fundamentals in parallel computing and relevant technologies. To best leverage diverse high-performance computing resources often requires well-crafted parallel computing strategies or algorithms. We review the use of parallel computing for geocomputational modeling by focusing on four aspects: spatial statistics, spatial optimization, spatial simulation, and cartography and geovisualization.

One major risk to the position estimation is the so called spoofing threat. A spoofer fakes satellite signals in order to mislead a GNSS receiver into estimating a wrong user position. A lot of research focuses on the detection and mitigation of spoofing by evaluating several metrics implemented in the receiver. However, beforehand it should be investigated under which conditions a receiver is affected by spoofing. In this work a simulation tool is described to simulate a scenario, where a receiver structure processes a signal containing an authentic and a spoofing signal. The parameters of the spoofing signal are variated. These simulations are repeated with different receiver settings in order to evaluate robust configurations for GNSS receivers. The results show that especially the coherent integration time in the receiver’s tracking loops has a large impact on the vulnerability of the receiver. © 2018 Institute of Navigation.

The aim of this study is a comparison and uncertainty analysis of two modelling concepts for assessment of soil loss and sediment transport in a small agricultural catchment, with an emphasis on estimating the off-site effects of soil erosion resulted in sedimentation of a small water reservoir. The small water reservoir (polder) of Svacenicky Creek which was built in 2012, is a part of the flood protection measures in Turá Lúka and is located in the western part of Slovakia, close to the town of Myjava. The town of Myjava in recent years has been threatened by frequent floods, which have caused heavy material losses and significantly limited the quality of life of the local residents. To estimate the amount of soil loss and sediments transported from the basin, we applied two modelling concepts based on the USLE/SDR and WaTEM/SEDEM erosion models and validated the results with the actual bathymetry of the polder. The measurements were provided by a modern Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) hydrographic instrument. From the sediment data measured and the original geodetic survey of the terrain conducted at the time of the construction of the polder, we calculated changes in the storage volume of the polder during its four years of operation. The results show that in the given area, there has been a gradual clogging of the bottom of the polder caused by water erosion. We estimate that within the four years of the acceptance run, 10,494 m                             3                              of bottom sediments on the Svacenicky Creek polder have accumulated. It therefore follows that repeated surveying of the sedimentation is very important for the management of the water reservoir.                          © E-flow Walter de Gruyter 2018.

Autonomous ships will also be exposed to the threat of cyberattacks, due to their need for connecting to operational, management and administrative systems onshore. The most critical hazards are possibly not associated with consequences for the ship itself or its cargo, but the threat to infrastructure along the coast and offshore if a ship under alien command is used as a “battering ram” to cause major structural damage. Even relatively small autonomous ships may pose a real threat, and ships sailing in international waters may come from distant locations. This implies that all autonomous ships may be considered as possible threats. This paper outlines the risk for some infrastructure systems. Even though the probability may be low, such events cannot be ruled out in the future, and the design of autonomous ships must involve a series of risk reducing actions and designs. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
"Questioning jewish caribbean identity","2018","Questioning Jewish Caribbean Identity","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061153123&partnerID=40&md5=56a4c9335ef96dfffb374582dc826e43","Questioning Jewish Caribbean Identities lends a fresh, psychological approach to identity and Jewishness in the Caribbean. It explores the ways in which individuals in the islands have maintained their connections to Judaism as lineage, as a religion and as a culture. Transported overseas from Spain and Portugal in the 1500s while fleeing the Inquisition, and later during the second wave of exodus from Europe under threat of World War II, the Caribbean provided safe harbours for a number of Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews. There is no doubt that their presence in the Caribbean and Latin America over the last 500 years has had a tremendous impact on the growth and development of industry, modern commerce and culture. Their contribution to their new island homelands has been a lasting one. From the technology for the cultivation of sugar and the development of trade and commerce across the Atlantic, to the arts and education, Jewish life within the region has left and continues to leave an indelible mark. For the author, there have been many stops along the way in completing this book. She has travelled and interacted with Jews across the globe, and these encounters were the genesis of the questions she asked herself about Jews of all descriptions. Indeed, many of the questions and their answers arise from an existential need to rationalise her own thoughts about her personal identity. This is a pattern that the author has noted among a number of the theorists included in this work. From Erickson with his Danish-Jewish background and the subsequent elaboration of his psychosocial theory; to Stuart Hall’s cultural theory, born out of his own mixed heritage and later inter-ethnic marriage; and Nathan Blumenthal, who changes his rather Jewish name to Nathaniel Branden as he becomes known for his psychology of self-esteem. Of course, it is impossible to speak of identity without acknowledging the seminal contribution of Freud’s psychoanalytic theory as a way of making meaning for ourselves in the world. Common to these theorist and many others, readers will encounter their own struggle with national, personal and ethnic identities while exploring the pages of this book. Claiming an identity suggests an autonomous act of loyalty to chosen identity, and for some this can mean the abandonment of previous ways of seeing themselves. This is the central threat of acts of identity; it signals, “I am with them” and equally, “I have no allegiance to you”. These are the sentiments over which battles are waged, causing people who appear indistinguishable from each other to obliterate neighbouring nations. This book is a story of the survival of a people, practice, culture, and religion. (Nova). © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.","Book","Final","Scopus"

Thus, MCRs have attracted considerable interest due to their atom economy, simple experimental procedures, automated synthesis, convenience and synthetic efficiency. Isocyanides are one of the crucial starting material in designing MCRs methods. They are unique building blocks in many cycloaddition reactions since they are able to react with both nucleophiles and electrophiles at the same carbon. Furthermore, ammonium chloride is an inorganic compound that is highly soluble in water, inexpensive and commercially available. Solutions of ammonium chloride are mildly acidic and have been used in various reactions. Objective: This article focuses on design a convenient and straightforward method for assembling important scaffolds such imidazolidinones through one-pot three-component strategy. Conclusion: The straightforward and efficient one-pot three component method for the synthesis of 4-(cyclohexylmethylene)-5-phenylimidazolidin-2-one derivatives is described.

Unsurprisingly, the cybersecurity of MCPS is of high concern, as they are life-critical systems that, if compromised, may result in dire consequences to the patient. A variety of security requirements have been developed over the past 10 years as a result of governmental acts such as HITECH in order to better secure and protect healthcare environments. However, it is unclear how applicable these re-quirements may be to MCPS infrastructures. As a result, this case study analyzes current healthcare security requirements and their applicability to MCPS using an approach that leverages ontological representations and automated requirement traversal techniques. Using such a methodology, we find that 70% of applicable requirements/risks for MCPS components are missing from the security documentation, including serious items such as Authentication, Data Encryption, DoS attacks, and Legacy Vulnerabilities. We also validate our results within real-world instances and find that almost half of the relevant requirements are not implemented within existing MCPS architectures. © 2018 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Aided inertial navigation is fundamentally a nonlinear observer design problem; thus, current solutions are based on approximations of the system dynamics, such as an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which uses a system’s Jacobian linearization along the current best estimate of its trajectory. On the basis of the theory of invariant observer design by Barrau and Bonnabel, and in particular, the Invariant EKF (InEKF), we show that the error dynamics of the point contact-inertial system follows a log-linear autonomous differential equation; hence, the observable state variables can be rendered convergent with a domain of attraction that is independent of the system’s trajectory. Due to the log-linear form of the error dynamics, it is not necessary to perform a nonlinear observability analysis to show that when using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and contact sensors, the absolute position of the robot and a rotation about the gravity vector (yaw) are unobservable. We further augment the state of the developed InEKF with IMU biases, as the online estimation of these parameters has a crucial impact on system performance. We evaluate the convergence of the proposed system with the commonly used quaternion-based EKF observer using a Monte-Carlo simulation.

One of its greatest opportunity and application still lies ahead in the form of smart home, known as push-button automated home. In this ubiquitous environment, due to the most likely heterogeneity of objects, communication, topology, security protocols, and the computationally limited nature of IoT objects, conventional authentication schemes may not comply with IoT security requirements since they are considered impractical, weak, or outdated. Focusing only on the issue of remote authentication in a smart home environment, in the presence of security threats, this paper proposes the design of a RSA-based two-factor user Authentication scheme for Smart-Home using Smart Card (denoted RSA-ASH-SC scheme). An informal security analysis of the proposed RSA-ASH-SC scheme is proposed as well as a study of its performance in terms of convergence speed, showing that the RSA-ASH-SC scheme is about 50% faster than the Om and Kumari scheme, and about 15 times faster than selected RSA variants in terms of RSA decryption speed when the RSA key length is 2048. The RSA-ASH-SC scheme is also shown to maintain the anonymity of the user using a one-time token. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The most important messages in these networks are broadcast-authenticated periodic one-hop beacons, used for safety and traffic efficiency applications such as collision avoidance and traffic jam detection. However, broadcast authenticity is not sufficient to guarantee message correctness. The goal of misbehavior detection is to analyze application data and knowledge about physical processes in these cyber-physical systems to detect incorrect messages, enabling local revocation of vehicles transmitting malicious messages. Comparative studies between detection mechanisms are rare due to the lack of a reference dataset. We take the first steps to address this challenge by introducing the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior Dataset (VeReMi) and a discussion of valid metrics for such an assessment. VeReMi is the first public extensible dataset, allowing anyone to reproduce the generation process, as well as contribute attacks and use the data to compare new detection mechanisms against existing ones. The result of our analysis shows that the acceptance range threshold and the simple speed check are complementary mechanisms that detect different attacks. This supports the intuitive notion that fusion can lead to better results with data, and we suggest that future work should focus on effective fusion with VeReMi as an evaluation baseline. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2018.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
"Estimation of the populations status and habitat conditions of anseriformes in the state nature reserve «gydansky» (Russia) using ultralight aviation","2018","Nature Conservation Research","10.24189/ncr.2018.070","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061771668&doi=10.24189%2fncr.2018.070&partnerID=40&md5=e214804c478c366a5f8d6f861d6696a9","The Gydan Peninsula is one of the least explored and inaccessible Arctic regions in both the Yamalo-Nenetsky Autonomous Okrug and Russia as a whole. In 2016-2017 we conducted a survey of the Gydansky State Nature Reserve and adjacent areas, counted and assessed the quality of habitats of Anseriformes and their threats. The results of the study and the data volume obtained have proved the effectiveness of using ultralight aviation to study a hard-to-reach and vast area. We elaborated the methodology of aerial surveys and counting, the technique of population abundance extrapolation based on modern statistical methods and the use of Landsat images. According to the data obtained, we created GIS databases on abundance, biotopic distribution, key conservation areas of Anseriformes and threats. On their basis, it will be possible to develop a scheme of long-term monitoring of Anseriformes, and specific recommendations on the protection regime. By preliminary assessing the habitat quality on the selected plots, we found that Anseriformes form main groupings on salt marshes, although their areas on the Gydansky Peninsula are not large. The preliminary study of the feeding spectrum of herbivory Anseriformes (Anser, Branta, Cygnus) showed that on three studied sites, a significant proportion of their diet is occupied by common plant species of salt marshes (Carex subspathacea + Puccinellia phryganodes). Studies of the pastures quality on salt marshes on molting sites and on control sites demonstrated that Anser albifrons and Branta bernicla provoked a decrease in phytomass of dead grass by an average of 5.3 times. This increases the pasture quality and prevents turfness. On the molting sites examined, the phytomass of the main feeding plants was on average 4.6 times less than on the control sites. However, we can not consider it as a negative influence, since the constant pasture grazing stimulates the vegetation growth. Based on data obtained during the preliminary study, we established the impact of Anseriformes on invertebrates. We found that on control sites, the number of spider species was two times higher than on molting sites, and their number was four times higher than on molting sites. There were no significant differences in the Acarini number. The presence of mass concentrations of Aneriformes influences the structure of dominance in the microarthropod communities. We did not establish the influence of the Anseriformes concentrations on the diversity and species composition of Coleoptera and Heteroptera. Although on sites of mass concentration of Anseriformes, the number of Heteroptera predators greatly reduced (in 3-23 times). We showed that Ursus maritimus have became an important factor that influence the Anseriformes abundance, especially colonial species. We distinguished the nine sites which are the most important for Anderiformes. Within these areas, annual monitoring of Anseriformes using ultralight aviation is most relevant. On the distinguished key sites outside the Gydansky State Nature Reserve, it would be advisable to create regional-level complex sanctuaries with complete hunting ban. The presence of people and transport in protected areas will create an increase in the disturbance factor and poaching. It is necessary to strengthen the protection regime and conduct raids to combat poaching both in the Gydansky State Nature Reserve and on distinguished key sites. We propose the use of ultralight aviation as the most effective method for these targets. The results of obtained aerial surveys showed that the highest abundance of Polysticta stelleri, Somateria spectabilis and Clangula huemalis, the maximal concentrations of molting Cygnus bewickii, Anser albifrons, A. Fabalis and Branta bernicla were recorded on Neupokoev Island and Vilkitsky Island. In this regard, we assert the necessity to revise the existing boundaries of the Gydansky State Nature Reserve by including into the Protected Area the following sites: Vilkitsky Island together with the Vostochnaya Spit and Shvede Bay, the Neupokoev Island together with the Neupokoeva Spit and water areas adjacent to these islands at a distance of 5 km from the coastline. © 2018 Nature Conservation Research.

It is critical to ensure that patches are propagated to all affected software timely, which, unfortunately, is often not the case. Thus the capability to accurately test the security patch presence in software distributions is crucial, for both defenders and attackers. Inspired by human analysts' behaviors to inspect only small and localized code areas, we present FIBER, an automated system that leverages this observation in its core design. FIBER works by first parsing and analyzing the open-source security patches carefully and then generating fine-grained binary signatures that faithfully reflect the most representative syntax and semantic changes introduced by the patch, which are used to search against target binaries. Compared to previous work, FIBER leverages the source-level insight strategically by primarily focusing on small changes of patches and minimal contexts, instead of the whole function or file. We have systematically evaluated FIBER using 107 real-world security patches and 8 Android kernel images from 3 different mainstream vendors, the results show that FIBER can achieve an average accuracy of 94% with no false positives. © 2018 Proceedings of the 27th USENIX Security Symposium.

We perform an attack that embeds a backdoor in the Mask R-CNN in ORPS by poisoning the dataset. Under normal circumstances, the backdoored model can accurately identify obstacles (vehicles). However, under certain circumstances, triggering the backdoor in the backdoored model may lead to change the size (bounding box and mask) and confidence of the detected obstacles, which may cause serious accidents. The experiment result shows that it is possible to embed a backdoor in ORPS. We can see that the backdoored network can obviously change the size of bounding box and corresponding mask of those poisoned instances. But on the other hand, embedding a backdoor in the deep learning based model will only slightly affect the accuracy of detecting objects without backdoor triggers, which is imperceptible for users. Eventually, we hope that our simple work can arouse people’s attention to the self-driving technology and even other deep learning based models.

The goal is an overall system concept and train equipment that is competent in high multipath environments, suitable for being integrated into the train safe platform ensuring at the same time economy on total cost of operations. Connected cars applications rely also on accurate and safe positioning and have in common with the trains the operational environment and a centralized command and control system. This paper introduce the give and take paradigm to liaise train control systems and autonomous cars stake holders and develop a common GNSS platform. The ambition is to export to the autonomous cars the safety capabilities of train control systems demonstrated during tens of years of operations, and to exploiting the large car’s market potential to lower the GNSS platform costs. The paper starts with the characteristics of the European Railways Train Management Systems (ERTMS) that guarantees the highest safety levels through a platform which is interoperable, standard and certifiable with harmonized procedures. Then we describe the plan to validate and certify the GNSS positioning applications into the ERTMS, which is one of the Game Changer technologies of the ERTMS evolution plan. The synergy with the connected cars is discussed by first introducing the virtual track concept to drive a car on the road as a train on the railways and then by developing the virtual horizon to safely monitor the way ahead detecting obstacles.

To limit costs, it is standard practice to select only the most suspicious transactions for investigation. We claim that a trade-off between exploration and exploitation is imperative to enable adaptation to changes in behavior (concept drift). Exploration consists of the selection and investigation of transactions with the purpose of improving predictive models, and exploitation consists of investigating transactions detected to be suspicious. Modeling the detection of fraudulent transactions as rewarding, we use an incremental Regression Tree learner to create clusters of transactions with similar expected rewards. This enables the use of a Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) algorithm to provide the exploration/exploitation trade-off. We introduce a novel variant of a CMAB algorithm that makes use of the structure of this tree, and use Semi-Supervised Learning to grow the tree using unlabeled data. The approach is evaluated on a real dataset and data generated by a simulator that adds concept drift by adapting the behavior of fraudsters to avoid detection. It outperforms frequently used offline models in terms of cumulative rewards, in particular in the presence of concept drift.

In this paper, we will provide an overview about HERACLES project while a particular focus will be put on the activities concerning close-range Remote Sensing data processing. By exploiting image and laser data acquired from UAVs and from the ground, we strive for precise and reliable 3D models that are useful for representation of the scene on the desired level of detail and thus for assessing potential damages and estimating risks. From oblique UAV-borne imagery, we will obtain textured airborne 3D models using photogrammetric methods of image alignment, dense point cloud reconstruction, meshing and texturing. To provide coverage for the objects' interiors, very dense point clouds from terrestrial laser scans can be additionally captured. A triangle mesh is obtained from these points and textured by means of terrestrial high-resolution photos, whereby the registration took place using a point-based method. We identified two main challenges: first, the reconstruction results from high-resolution UAV images were not always satisfying due to a low coverage; to cope with this, extensive interactive corrections must be undertaken. Moreover, seamless merging of triangle meshes provided by aerial photogrammetric reconstruction and by terrestrial laser scans is cumbersome because of varying density and accuracy of 3D points in both meshes. © 2018 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Being a fierce predator, having no natural predator, being adaptive to different habitats, and being with high reproduction rates, the red lionfish has enervated current endeavors to control their population. This paper focuses on the first steps to reinforce these efforts by employing autonomous vehicles. To that end, an assistive underwater robotic scheme is designed to aid spear-hunting divers to locate and more efficiently hunt the lionfish. A small-sized, open source ROV with an integrated camera is programmed using Deep Learning methods to detect red lionfish in real time. Dives are restricted to a certain depth range, time, and air supply. The ROV program is designed to allow the divers to locate the red lionfish before each dive, so that they can plan their hunt to maximize their catch. Lightweight, portability, user-friendly interface, energy efficiency, and low cost of maintenance are some advantages of the proposed scheme. The developed system's performance is examined in areas currently invaded by the red lionfish in the Gulf of Mexico.

The present study was carried out to determine the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens in the outpatient departments (OPDs) at the clinics of Qassim University, Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to December 2016. Nonrepetitive midstream urine samples (1273) were cultured on standard culture media. Identification and susceptibility testing of causative microorganisms was performed using the fully automated VITEK 2 Compact system. Results: Out of the 1273 nonrepetitive urine samples, 418 (32.8%) exhibited significant growth of UTI-causing microbes, 377 (90.2%) of which were Gram-negative bacilli. The commonly isolated microorganisms were Escherichia coli (157, 37.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (70, 16.7%), Proteus mirabilis (17, 4.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24, 5.8%), Enterobacter cloacae (11, 2.6%), Enterococcus faecalis (12, 2.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (14, 3.3%). Overall, drug resistance was observed in 91.3% (n=381/418) of the samples, with a majority (80%) exhibiting resistance to at least 2 drugs. Drug resistance was commonly observed against ampicillin (89.9%), oxacillin (75.6%), piperacillin (85.4%), clindamycin (56.1%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (74.5%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (50.4%). Conclusion: The uropathogens E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa and multidrug resistance pose serious therapeutic threats in the setting of this study. A concerted and systematic effort is required to rapidly identify high-risk patients and to reduce the burden of antimicrobial resistance in this region. © 2018 Al Wutayd et al.","Article","Final","Scopus"

An obstacle avoidance algorithm was developed using an integrated system involving proportional navigation (PN) and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC). An obstacle avoidance variant of the classical proportional navigation law generates command lateral accelerations to avoid obstacles, while the NMPC is used to track the reference trajectory given by the PN. The NMPC utilizes a lateral vehicle dynamic model. Obstacle avoidance has become a popular area of research for both unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles. In this application an obstacle avoidance algorithm can take over the control of a vehicle until the obstacle is no longer a threat. The performance of the obstacle avoidance algorithm is evaluated through simulation. Simulation results show a promising approach to conditionally implemented obstacle avoidance.

"Tactical pilot assistant and denied environments: Incorporating socio-technical factors in simulations","2018","2018 Winter Simulation Innovation Workshop, SIW 2018","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060512172&partnerID=40&md5=43f0e7e0d2e473d670df28b38b3c7593","In proposed designs, tactical pilot assistants incorporate artificial intelligence (AI), advanced human-systems interaction, and networked access to data and sensors to provide decision aiding of unprecedented sophistication. In conventional air combat scenarios, a tactical pilot assistant could, for instance, monitor aircraft systems, interpret and carry out pilot commands, and advise the pilot about systems status, mission progress, and threats. Such agents are particularly valuable during operations in contested environments, where pilots may be subject to denied communications, spoofed navigation systems, and other forms of electronic warfare (EW) disruptions. In Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) contexts, the tactical pilot assistant could alert the pilot when denial attacks such as datalink jamming or GPS spoofing are detected and recommend countermeasures. A2/AD effects could also degrade the integrity of the tactical pilot assistant itself, motivating systemic simulations early in design. The functions of a tactical pilot assistant and the pilot go well beyond the mechanics of maneuvering the aircraft. Tactical pilot assistants and their human pilots are part of a socio-technical system, where people and agents are inherently part of a network of operations that may involve ambiguous communications and dynamic roles and responsibilities. Combat sorties, for example, require considerable interaction within and across aircraft and remotely with people and agents on the ground. Developing, testing and integrating a tactical pilot assistant requires simulations that capture the complexities and vulnerabilities of an information-rich, networked, digital, automated world. Simulations that reflect socio-technical processes are needed to model the effects of human-automation interaction under both nominal and off-nominal conditions. Socio-technical context is not just a backdrop for simulation, but must be an explicit factor in a tactical pilot assistant’s threat assessments and course of action recommendations. Detecting and overcoming problems with sociotechnical lapses, whether benign or the result of hostile action, is one example. Communications and data disruptions, as in combat forces operating under conditions of denied access to information, can also have devastating emergent effects on the way people and intelligent systems work together. Simulating how people and automated systems interact in an uncertain, dynamic environment provides analysts and planners with a tool to assess risk and design and evaluate countermeasures, in particular, a tactical pilot assistant that enables a pilot to fight through such events. Simulations are thus needed that can properly capture work practices of the socio-technical system. To address this need, we adopt a socio-technical approach to simulating activity, namely situated, interactive behavior, that includes a spatial/geographical model, cultural features and objects, and information systems. In this paper, we present our simulation methodology that captures the activities of individuals and the socio-technical context. We describe current research in support of a tactical pilot assistant that employs this simulation approach for predictive analysis and constructive agent control in simulations of uncertain, complex threats. This work, in concert with related research contributing complementary capabilities, will accelerate the development of a robust tactical pilot assistant. © Winter Simulation Innovation Workshop, SIW 2018.

One of the challenges that still needs investigation is human-robot communication regarding making decisions based on extracted information. As such, the purpose of this research is to address issues of decision making after communication disconnections through interface design by focusing on improving sensemaking. Analyzing the effects of interface design in a UAV threat assessment scenario is ideal to examine not only the sensemaking process but also how that process defines decision making in an environment where efficient decision making and low clutter displays are needed. The data from this study will serve determine elements of an optimal interface for information assimilation. Twenty participants were recruited to complete a series of sixteen threat assessment decisions with different interface designs, varying amounts of information and layouts of information. It was observed that level of detailed information had a significant effect on the subjective trust and decision selected and display layout had a significant effect on the time taken to complete a decision. © 2018 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES).

The classification of the LSS UAVs is given. The existing threats of using LSS UAVs are divided into three categories. Special attention is paid to the third category of threats, the main feature of which is a high level of training of the operator. Main advantages and drawbacks of LSS UAVs are considered. It is determined that the best strategy is to employ a hierarchy of countermeasures including regulatory countermeasures (prevention, deterrence, denial), passive countermeasures (detection and interruption) and active countermeasures (destruction). State of the art and current problems of possible countermeasures are analysed. The most promising LSS UAVs’ counteraction technologies are described. Most attention is paid to specialized sensors and modern active counteraction means, such as programmable air burst munition and high‐energy laser systems. © 2018, University of Defence.

However, with the population and increasing usage of deep learning based models, not many people take into account the potential security risks which are likely to cause accidents in them. This paper mainly studies on the potential safety hazards in the obstacle recognition and processing system (ORPS) of the self-driving cars, which is constructed by deep learning architecture. We perform an attack that embeds a backdoor in the Mask R-CNN in ORPS by poisoning the dataset. The experiment result shows that it is possible to embed a backdoor in ORPS. We can see that the backdoored network can accurately recognize and trigger the backdoors in the poisoned dataset, which obviously change the size of bounding box and corresponding mask of those poisoned instances. But on the other hand, embedding a backdoor in the deep learning based model will only slightly affect the accuracy of detecting objects without backdoor triggers, which is imperceptible for users. Furthermore, in order to study the working mode of the backdoor and the possibility of detecting the backdoor in the network, we visualize the weights matrices in the backdoored network and try to modify them, but the results show that the existence of the backdoor in network is very cryptic, so it is difficult for users to detect and filter it. Eventually, we hope that our simple work can arouse people’s attention to the self-driving technology and even other deep learning based models. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Through 2D airfoil design, the S5010-15 airfoil is chosen, of which the maximum lift coefficient is about 1.33, and the stall angle of attack (alpha) is around 13°. When the alpha is below 12°, the drag coefficient is below 0.02. The maximum lift-drag ratio can reach 103 at 6.5°. 3D aerodynamic analysis of take-off, cruise and landing configurations shows that all the requirements can be satisfied. Take-off lift coefficient can reach 1 0 at -6° elevators & elevons deflection and 12° angle of attack, and the drag coefficient is about 0.07. Cruise lift coefficient can reach 0.4 at 4° angle of attack with clean wing, and the drag coefficient is about 0.028. For this demonstrator, landing is similar to take-off. Laser-cutting wood plates are used for the spars, ribs and frames, and glass fiber composite for the skin.

Autonomous systems rely on software and communications. Security vulnerabilities of software and communication will give adversaries possibilities to attack and compromise security and safety. Therefore, when analysing safety, security should be co-analysed. In this study, we explored three safety and security co-analysis methods: Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) plus STPA-Security Analysis (STPA-Sec), Failure Mode, Vulnerabilities and Effect Analysis (FMVEA), and Combined Harm Assessment of Safety and Security for Information Systems (CHASSIS). The purpose is to compare applicability, efficiency, and hazards identified by the different methods. An autonomous boat is used as the case study. Results of the study show that STPA plus STPA-Sec and CHASSIS can be more time consuming to use than FMVEA. However, STPA plus STPA-Sec and CHASSIS can help analysers identify more hazards of autonomous systems than FMVEA. Results of the study reveals weaknesses of each method to analyse autonomous systems with different levels of autonomy. We therefore propose possible improvements and combinations of the methods. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The increasing interest of the scientific community to simplify SAR sensors and develop automatic system to quickly obtain a sufficiently good precision image is fostered by the will of developing low-cost/light-weight SAR systems to be carried by drones. Standard SAR raw data processing techniques assume uniform motion of the satellite (or aerial vehicle) and a fixed antenna beam pointing sideway orthogonally to the motion path, assumed rectilinear.

Some features of autonomous vehicle are sensing the environment, collecting information and managing communication with other vehicles. Many autonomous vehicles in development use a combination of cameras, sensors, GPS, radar, LiDAR, and on-board computers. These technologies work together to map the vehicle's position and its proximity to everything around it. Because of their reliance on these sorts of technologies, which are easily accessible to tampering, a autonomous vehicles are susceptible to cyber attacks if an attacker can discover a weakness in a certain type of vehicle or in a company's electronic system.

Since 2015 the number of papers related to the avoidance of such collisions has increased significantly. The most part of methods and algorithms require increasing computational capacity of on-board computer systems that is essential for detecting and tracking dynamic threats and implementing maneuvers of collision avoidance. Many researchers suggest the usage of automatic dependent surveillance system (ADS-B) or analogues to decrease computational costs for detecting and tracking dynamic threats. Computational costs can be also decreased via replacing numerical algorithms by analytical ones. In the paper a new method of selection and implementation of collision avoidance maneuvers is suggested. UAV trajectories are approximated by two or three trajectory points obtained from ADS-B system. Then, using analytical expressions, two cutoff values of the critical speed range, at which a collision is possible, are calculated. As calculation expressions for meeting points and cutoff values of the critical speed are represented in the analytical form, even if an on-board computer system has limited computational capacity, the time for calculation will be far less than the time of receiving data from ADS-B. For this reason, calculations can be updated at each cycle of new data receiving, and the trajectory approximation can be bounded by straight lines. Such an approach allows developing compact algorithm of collision avoidance, even for a significant number of UAVs (more than several dozens). Research adequacy is proved by modeling using a software system developed specifically for this purpose. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Therefore, in this paper we will show an approach to test security aspects, based on virtual instrumentation. The approach is to use a framework that executes the application under development on a virtual model of the target micro controller. An interception library generates scenarios systematically, whereas the effects on registers and memory are monitored. We are intercepting the running software at vulnerable functions and variables to detect potential malfunctions. This will detect security vulnerabilities of all internal failure even if no malicious behavior at the interfaces occur. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

Effective and skilful interaction between the sensors and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles is required to actuate the communication in the network. In the existence of malicious nodes, this leads to critical security issues especially in pressure based routing protocols. Thus, an effective security scheme is indispensable for efficient data transmission. In this paper, the prime aim is to detect the virulent nodes in pressure routing by formulating Collaborative Entrapping Scheme (CES). It is observed that incorporating CES in the pressure based routing protocol effectively detects and prevents the virulent nodes from participating in the routing process, but introduces an overhead. To decrease the overhead due to the CES approach, in this paper, a fraction of data packet (Dfrac) only is used to indicate the successful reception which reduces the end to end delay. Simulation results indicate that the proposed Secure Pressure based Routing protocol shows performance improvement compared to the existing Depth Based and Hydro cast Routing protocols even in the presence of multiple malicious nodes. © 2018 Eastern Macedonia and Thrace Institute of Technology.","Article","Final","Scopus"

For example, in the avionic sector, visual inspection and quality control procedures are extremely important, since the critical parts such as oil ducts of the gearbox and engine components are often contaminated. Currently, the inspection procedures are carried out by workers and exploiting some primary level of instruments such as endoscope or fiberscope. As human operation causes errors, the deficiency in the inspection cannot be nullified completely. Hence, the goal of this study is to design a novel automated robotic probe for reducing the critical level of these visual inspections. The proposed inspection system is suited for checking ducts and cavities, with some channels thinner than 6 mm in diameter. The robotic probe has been developed and tested in a real industrial scenario; a real aircraft gearbox has been inspected with the proposed probe and it successfully identified unwanted residuals such as sand, machining swarf, metallic dust and obstructions.

The detection and classification of mine-like objects is conducted offline, after a scan has been completed while the actual identification and neutralization of potential targets is executed in a separate minehunting operation. In this paper the various influences on the imaging sonar system and, moreover, the resulting sonar imagery are assessed with regard to affecting the Probability of Detection and Classification (PDC). Image quality, sharpness and Signal-To-Noise Ratio (SNR) are among the more obvious and straightforwardly quantifiable factors. The complexity of a sonar image, however, can have a significant impact as well. Image lacunarity is used to characterize the seafloor in order to assess the corresponding minehunting difficulty.

In healthcare, particularly Intelligent Clinical Decision Support Systems (ICDSS) have the potential to enhance medical care by suggesting diagnosis or treatment plans(Agarwal and Dhar, 2014). However, one wrong decision can have fatal consequences. Hence, these systems require active users which have to handle the output of these systems. At the same time, ICDSS challenge physicians' professional identity by being autonomous and potentially superior in decision-making. These systems can be threatening to physicians' self-understanding or be perceived as enhancement to traditional roles. Our research aims to explore how ICDSS change the professional identity of physicians and which different strategies physicians use to deal with upcoming changes. We are currently developing a mixed-method research study combing quantitative and qualitative data from a survey and in-depth interviews. In this research proposal, we present a literature-based framework, our research approach, and preliminary qualitative results.

The purpose of this work is to develop and verify algorithm for positioning a transmitting radio source in Non-Line-of-Sight Conditions (NLOS) using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in three dimensional space. Algorithm under consideration implements time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements processing for identification of receivers with NLOS measurements. Algorithm operability is illustrated for the layout including terrestrial segment with ground receiver stations and flying segment with receiving sensors aboard UAVs. The method used for NLOS identification and mitigation exploits the comparison of variance for intermediate location estimates calculated for different TDOA measurements combinations among all possible sets of receivers with thresholds. Algorithm was realized in simulation model including system level, link level and visualization model subsystems. TDOA system level model represents positioning layout with distributed transmitter, receivers, obstacles and NLOS reflectors in three dimensional space. TDOA link level model represents radio links between transmitter, receivers, and NLOS reflectors taking into account actual pathloss, signal modulation, sampling rate, additive noise and cross-correlation calculation. Comparing with the case on the plane, TDOA measurements processing in three dimensional space case with flying receiver aboard UAVs reveals substantially higher thresholds of calculated variances to reliably identify and exclude NLOS source. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Because of the lambda-shape planform and associated flow phenomena including shocks and vortices, the aerodynamic design process relies heavily on high-fidelity CFD predictions. This enables accurate prediction of flight dynamics and any potential issues early in the design process. The flight dynamics model would be based on a reduced order model (ROM) derived from CFD calculations. This work investigates the creation of a ROM using nonlinear indicial response functions. The response functions are obtained using a grid motion approach that separates the effects of angle of attack and pitch rate. This approach is followed using three different CFD codes from various organizations: ENSOLV at the Netherlands Aerospace Centre, USM3D at NASA Langley Research Center, and Kestrel at the United States Air Force Academy. The ROM predictions were tested with a manoeuver resembling a low speed pull-up. The predictions are found to be sensitive to the quality of the steady state solutions from which step response calculations were started, as well as the convergence of the step response calculations themselves. Nevertheless, the indicial response method can provide accurate predictions including transient effects, and as such is a powerful method for building ROMs. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

To this end, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can adjust the flight altitude to increase the resolution only where needed, making non-uniform coverage strategies efficient both in time and energy expenditure. In a multi-UAV monitoring context, it is nece ssary to deploy UAVs to inspect in parallel those areas where a higher resolution is required. To address this problem, we propose a decentralised deployment strategy inspired by the collective beh aviour of honeybees. This strategy dynamically assigns UAVs to different areas to be monitored, and suitably re-assigns them to other areas when needed.

These entities will range from other vehicles (V2V), infrastructure units placed along roadways (V2I), and even bicycles or pedestrians (V2X). A feature of this new technology is the concept of intelligent intersection management. This concept can be defined in two groups: decentralized and centralized. Decentralized intersection management occurs when vehicles send V2V packets between themselves to travel safely through intersections. Centralized intersection management incorporates a Road-Side Units to act as a dedicated manager to receive travel requests from vehicles and assign reservations for each vehicle. Centralized management allows for fully autonomous vehicles to travel safely through intersections without collisions. However, an evolutionary process from decentralized to centralized is necessary for real-world implementation. V2V applications are susceptible to many unforeseen factors and require extensive testing to ensure safety. For many situations, such testing can and should be accomplished via modeling and simulation. By simulating results within a synthetic world, the research is able to manipulate all variables and parameters allowing precise component testing. This paper specifies prior test scenarios that would have benefited from the use of synthetic modeling. Response factors and constraints are given for each scenario for how they would be created within a synthetic world. In addition, cyber threat models are discussed with each scenario. These threat models explain how malicious actors seize and manipulate Vehicle Ad Hoc Networks. Lastly, mitigation techniques for the cyber threat models are presented. This paper argues that synthetic modeling should be extensively used to develop VANET security to streamline development and deployment of V2V, V2I, and V2X technologies by reducing costs and safety concerns. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

In post-disaster scenarios, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to capture image and video data from the disaster area and transfer the data to a ground station, owing to their rapid mobility. However, packet forwarding is a challenge because of unstable links and intermittent connectivity in highly dynamic UAV networks. In this paper, we propose a location-aided delay tolerant routing (LADTR) protocol for UAV networks for use in post-disaster operations, which exploits location-aided forwarding combined with a store-carry-forward (SCF) technique. Ferrying UAVs are introduced to enable an efficient SCF, and this is the first attempt at introducing and using ferrying UAVs for routing in UAV networks, to the best of our knowledge. Ferrying UAVs improve the availability of connection paths between searching UAVs and the ground station, thus reducing end-to-end delays and increasing the packet delivery ratio. Future UAV locations are estimated based on the location and speed of UAVs equipped with a global positioning system. The forwarding UAV node predicts the position of the destination UAV node and then decides where to forward. The proposed LADTR ensures that the contact rate between UAV nodes remains high, which enables a high packet delivery ratio, and ensures single-copy data forwarding to avoid replication of each message. Our performance study shows that the proposed LADTR outperforms the four typical routing protocols reported in the literature in terms of packet delivery ratio, average delay, and routing overhead. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The review is motivated by the increasing use of small UAVs for inspecting critical infrastructures such as the electric utility transmission and distribution grid, which could be a target for terrorism. The paper presents a modified taxonomy to organize cyber-attacks on UAVs and exploiting threats by Attack Vector and Target. It shows that, by Attack Vector, there has been one physical attack and ten remote attacks. By Target, there have been six attacks on GPS (two jamming, four spoofing), two attacks on the control communications stream (a deauthentication attack and zero-day vulnerabilities attack), and two attacks on data communications stream (two intercepting the data feed, zero executing a video replay attack). The paper also divides and discusses the findings by large or small UAVs, over or under 25 kg, but concentrates on small UAVs. The survey concludes that UAV-related research to counter cybersecurity threats focuses on GPS Jamming and Spoofing but ignores attacks on the controls and data communications stream. The gap in research on attacks on the data communications stream is concerning, as an operator can see a UAV flying off course due to a control stream attack but has no way of detecting a video replay attack (substitution of a video feed). © 2018 IQPC.

By using a numerical simulation method, the effects of different angles of attack, heights from the ground, and take-off velocity on the UAV were studied. Moreover, based on comparisons with test data in previous literature, the numerical calculation method was verified to be accurate. The height from the ground is the primary factor influencing longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of the UAV. With the increase in height from the ground, the lift and drag coefficients of the UAV, and its pitching stability, increased. When the angle of attack was small, a large suction area was generated on the lower surface of wings with a large suction amplitude therewith. This results in a large range of downwash. As the angle of attack increased, the lower surface of the trailing edge for wings presents weakening downwash. As the take-off velocity rose, the suction area on the lower surface of the UAV, and its amplitude, gradually decreased, and the negative pressure on the upper surface also decreased to a certain extent. The research results can provide a certain theoretical basis for the safe design of take-off operations for medium-aspect-ratio UAVs. © 2018 Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

Alas, these advances have also raised a number of concerns on AI's social, economic, and legal impact. Hence, the definition of design principles and automated methods to support transparent intelligent machine deliberation is highly desirable. Argumentation is important for handling conflicting beliefs, assumptions, opinions, goals, and many other mental attitudes. Argumentation pervades human intelligent behavior, and I believe that it is a mandatory element to conceive autonomous artificial machines that can exploit argumentation models and tools in the cognitive tasks they are required to carry out.

The GRAPE project is an ECHORD++ robotic experiment aimed at the use of a mobile robot for automatic pheromone dispenser distribution in vineyards, to reduce pesticide use thanks to pheromone mate disruption. This work describes the autonomous navigation system of such robot. For the specific scenario a real state of the art does not exists, so we adapted techniques that have been designed for different problems, in particular classical methods for navigation and mapping in indoor environments. The vineyard environment is challenging because of many variability factors such as weather, soil and vegetation. These factors hinder the indoor methods introducing noise in the robot perceptions. To solve this problem, we propose a specific navigation system that takes advantage of multiple sensors: wheel encoders, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GPS to filter the environment noise and accurately estimate the robot odometry. In addition, the system exploits a LIDAR sensor to localize the robot, through the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) algorithm, and to map the vineyard. We tested the system in simulation with very good results which have been confirmed during field tests in a real vineyard. © 2018","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In our system, a magnetometer is rigidly attached to the vehicle and not towed by a cable, minimizing the system's size and complexity but requiring a dedicated calibration procedure due to magnetic distortion caused by the vehicle. Conventional 2-D methods can be employed for the calibration by assuming the horizontal movement of the magnetometer, and the proposed 3-D approach can correct for horizontal misalignment of the sensor. Our method does not require a supporting crane system to rotate the vehicle, and calibrates and maps simultaneously by exploiting data obtained from field operation.

However, 2D imaging systems are not capable to detect a very small target and they are also not capable of calculating target 3D position coordinates to develop the strategic counter method. 3D sensors (e.g. Lidar, RGBD and stereo camera) are utilized to control unmanned vehicles for detecting threats and response for specific situations. Conventional Lidar systems are unable to detect small drone threat at distances higher than their maximum detecting range of 100 ?1/4 120 meters. To overcome this limitation, laser radar (LADAR) systems are being developed, which allow the detection at distances up to 2 kilometers. In the development of LADAR, it is difficult to acquire datasets that contain cases of long distant targets. In this study, a fusion data generation with virtual targets technique based on minimum real LADAR initial map dataset is proposed, and precise small target detection method using voxel-based clustering and classification are studied.

The effectiveness of plasma flow control by microsecond dielectric barrier discharge (μs-DBD), and by nanosecond dielectric barrier discharge (NS-DBD) are compared through the wind tunnel tests, showing a similar performance between μs-DBD and NS-DBD. Furthermore, the μs-DBD is implemented on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which is a scaled model of a newly developed amphibious plane. The wingspan of the model is 2.87m, and the airspeed is no less than 30m/s. The flight data, static pressure data, and Tufts images are recorded and analyzed in detail. Results of the flight test show that the μs-DBD works well on board without affecting the normal operation of the UAV model.

The key advantage is the simplicity of the upper layer, which reduces the computational burden, albeit with some expected loss of optimality if compared to the global optimum.

For the robots to overcome wind disturbances, it necessitates better insights into the interaction between the aerodynamics of flapping wings in the presence of winds and the robot's actuation system. In this paper, we consider the effects of constant frontal wind on a direct-drive flapping wing robot with passively rotating hinges and a compliant transmission. A simplified quasi-steady model that encapsulates the effects of frontal wind on aerodynamic forces is proposed. The model facilitates the calculation of periodic aerodynamic forces from nominal flapping kinematics. When combined with the dynamics of the actuation system, we are able to predict the lift force generated by the robot from the driving signals, without direct measurements of the flapping kinematics or the angle of attack. The proposed framework was experimentally verified on a flapping-wing robot prototype with a single wingspan of 76 mm. The results reveal up to 40% increases in lift when the robot was subject to 2.5 m/s horizontal winds. An analysis of the frequency response of the system is also provided to explain the resonance principles of the robot in the presence of frontal winds. © 2018 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The baseline wing and winglet configurations correspond to an already existing MALE UAV platform, whereas the winglet cant angle is selected as the morphing parameter. More specifically, seven different cant angle configurations are computationally examined in three pre-defined flight segments, at several angles of attack, by solving the RANS equations. Using the data from the computational analyses, the polynomial equations that best describe the lift curve, drag polar, L/D ratio, and root bending moment are extracted through interpolation and the performance maps of the morphing wingtip are drawn. The potential benefits are evaluated using dedicated performance metrics, by employing in-house performance assessment tools. A morphing mechanism, along with its corresponding weight penalty and integration issues are also presented and discussed. The results of this study show that the morphing winglet concept can be used to fine-tune the flight performance of a long endurance UAV, by adopting on the needs of the various mission segments on-demand. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The on-going cheaper costs of sensors and processors, and also wireless connectivity make it feasible to use the drones for several applications ranging from military to civilian. Since most of the applications using the drones involved in the IoD are real-time based applications, the users (external parties) usually have their interest in getting the real-time services from the deployed drones belonging to a particular fly zone. To address this important issue in the IoD, there is a great need of an efficient and secure user authentication approach in which an authorized user (for example, a driver of an ambulance) in the IoD environment can be given access to the data directly from an accessed drone. In this article, we first discuss an authentication model used in the IoD communication. We then discuss some security challenges and requirements for the IoD environment. A taxonomy of various security protocols in the IoD environment is also discussed. We then emphasis on the study of some recently proposed user authentication schemes for the IoD communication. A detailed comparative study is done based on functionality features, security attacks, and also communication and computation costs. Through the rigorous comparative study of the existing schemes, we identify the strengths and weaknesses of the user authentication schemes for the IoD communication.

For these reasons, the preparation, tuning and exploitation of navigation systems require different development steps to achieve reliability and robustness.

Although current researches and methods can deal with the UAV safety problems well at some extent, the effectiveness of them is greatly reduced when the UAV is in a highly antagonism and harsh environment. In this work, the autonomous safety control method for the UAV system is researched and explored from the need of improving the operational security of UAV system. UAV safety control method based on cognition-guidance refers to that the UAV can rely on perceptual and cognitive computing functions of the UAV system during the flight guidance to perceive and identify the forthcoming or ongoing security risks and to generate a correct evasion strategy. Cognition-guidance is a specific application of the cognitive computing. The safety connotation of the UAV and the research status of safety control are firstly analyzed, then, the relationship between the guidance and human cognition is discussed, and the UAV safety control method based on cognition-guidance is proposed. Besides, the UAV anti-collision control strategy is designed, and taking the two UAVs anti-collision control mission as an example, the simulation research for the UAV safety control method based on cognition-guidance is studied.

FloEFD utilizes an Immersed Boundary Method based Cartesian mesh technique. Boundary layers are resolved using laminar/turbulent Modified Wall Functions. Experimental testing is conducted in the NIAR Walter H. Beech Wind Tunnel using a one-third scale wind tunnel model of the UAV. The wind tunnel model is fabricated using additive manufacturing techniques. Results from the numerical model are compared with the experimental results. Two approaches are studied in the numerical model-the thin boundary layer approach (with Solution Adaptive Refinement) and the hybrid boundary layer approach. For the thin boundary layer approach, there is good correlation in prediction of lift, drag and pitch moment with the wind tunnel test results, for small to moderately high angles of attack, where flow remains attached. This approach also works well for prediction of side force, roll and yaw moments for sideslip angles. The hybrid boundary layer approach significantly improves prediction of lift at high angles of attack, but slightly under-predicts maximum lift coefficient. Drag is over-predicted at high angles of attack with both the approaches and is noted to be a major drawback of Cartesian mesh based solvers such as FloEFD. Pitch moment at high angles of attack is better predicted with the thin boundary layer approach. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

While operating as autonomous as possible, the subsystems should exploit the capabilities and desires of neighboring systems in a cooperative way to avoid conflicts and optimize overall performance. Increasing interconnections, together with autonomous behavior, however, challenge the system design and control. Distributed model predictive control strategies allow to break the complexity of interconnected systems, as each subsystem employs its own controller, taking information obtained or provided by the neighboring systems into account. We propose a distributed model predictive control strategy, in which the subsystems provide multiple options of possible future behaviors to their neighbors. The options are provided in form of contracts - outer bounds of the variables of the coupling variables. The neighboring systems take these options in their predictions into account and choose the most suitable one.

The application of the UGVs also allows to minimize requirements regarding soldiers' presence in such tasks as border patrolling and supply transports in military active areas. Although the benefits and uses of UGVs are very desirable, the use of Unmanned Transport Vehicles (UTV) introduces new concerns about the safety of soldiers and manned vehicles.

Birds mitigate these limitations by adapting their wings and feather shapes during flight. Equipped with a set of small feathers, known as the alula, located near the leading edge and covering 5% to 20% of the span, bird wings can sustain the lift necessary to fly at low velocities and high angles of attack. This paper presents the effect on lift generation of different placements of a Leading-Edge Alula-inpsired Device (LEAD) along the span of a moderate aspect-ratio wing. The device is modeled after the alula on a bird, and it increases the capability of a wing to maintain higher pressure gradients by modifying the near-wall flow close to the leading-edge. It also generates tip vortices that modify the turbulence on the upper-surface of the wing, delaying flow separation. The effect of the LEAD can be compared to traditional slats or vortex generators on two-dimensional wings. For finite wings, on the other hand, the effect depends on the interaction between the LEADs tip vortices and those from the main structure. Wind tunnel experiments were conducted on a cambered wing at post-stall and deep-stall angles of attack at low Reynolds numbers of 100,000 and 135,000. To quantify the aerodynamic effect of the device, the lift generated by the wing with and without the LEAD were measured using a 6-axis force and torque transducer, and the resulting lift coefficients were compared. Results show that the location of the LEAD yielding the highest lift enhancement was 50% semi-span away from the wing root. Lift improvements of up to 32% for post stall and 37% for deep stall were obtained at this location, demonstrating that the three-dimensional effects of the LEAD are important. The lift enhancement was also more prominent on a finite moderate aspect-ratio wing (3D) than on an airfoil (2D), confirming that the LEAD is a three-dimensional device. Identifying the configurations and deployment parameters that improve lift generation the most is needed to design an adaptive LEAD that can be implemented on a UAV wing for increased mission-adaptability.

Lift coefficient (CL), drag coefficient (CD) and pitching moment coefficient (CM) are analyzed at 20 m/s air velocity, using NUMECA Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. Three wing locations are selected, i.e.: initial location (in reference to the BWB Prototype), front location (30% from leading edge), and middle location (in between of the first two cases). The canard and wing tips from the BWB Prototype are removed for this study. Grid independence study is completed to observe the effect of number of cells on the computation results. Comparison between the CFD and wind tunnel results on the initial BWB Prototype is performed for validation purpose. The variation of CL, CD and CM are presented in curves of lift coefficient, drag coefficient and pitching moment coefficient against angles of attack (a). The lift coefficient curves give similar trends for the three wing locations and the initial configuration except between 20° - 35° angles of attack where different fluctuation behavior occurs on the curves. The maximum lift coefficient obtained is around 0.86 - 1.05 at α = 26° - 30°. Drag coefficient curves also show similar trend for the three wing locations, but lower than the initial configuration due to removal of the canard and wing tips. The pitching moment curves show significant difference in slope among the three placements of the wing for a above 10°. The pitching moment coefficient curves indicates negative slopes up to of α = 18° (initial and middle case) and α = 22° (front case) which indicates static stability for all cases. Curves show that the middle wing configuration continues to give static stability up to higher angles of attack whereas the front case provides the best static stability up to α = 22°. Overall the absence of canard and wing tips removes the sudden change of slope of pitching moment around α = 12° which initially occurs on the BWB-UAV Prototype. © 2018 Authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Exfiltration and/or modification of data is also a risk for space systems. Although the attack surface to space systems (supply chain, ground systems, networks, user terminals) is usually well protected, there is a high motivation for adversaries to seek out potential vulnerabilities on the spacecraft. Spacecraft architectures are typically based on heritage subsystems of hardware/software/firmware including real-time operating systems, embedded processors, shared bus architectures, and custom ASICs. These systems are highly redundant and resilient to component failures, since operation in the space environment of 15+ years is typical. However, spacecraft architectures were typically not designed with the cyber threat in mind. Well known cyber threat concepts (malware, privilege elevation, root-kits, system pivots, stack overflow, man-in-the-middle, reconnaissance) should now be considered when designing cyber defense for the spacecraft. A unique challenge for spacecraft cyber defense is the potential for denial-of-service attacks through the ""safe mode"" of the spacecraft. A cyber resilient spacecraft that is under attack will continue mission critical activities, initiate defensive measures, and ""operate through"" the attack without a trigger to a non-operational ""safe mode"" state. The Aerospace Corporation and Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute (SEI) are researching new approaches to spacecraft flight software for cyber resilient operations. This research includes: cyber threats relevant to the space environment, strengths and potential vulnerabilities for typical flight code processing, runtime assurance, analytics & detection, autonomous defense, and cyber assurance in the software lifecycle. Concepts will likely have application for avionics, SCADA, and other real-time operating environments. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This multitask learning is further coupled with an adversarial arm to promote the generation of feasible structures. We have trained this network using ~4000 labeled trans-rectal ultrasound images and tested on an independent set of images with ground truth landmark locations.

However, it has been observed that even highly trained networks are very vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Adding minimal changes to inputs that are correctly classified can lead to wrong predictions, raising serious security and safety concerns. Existing techniques for checking robustness against such perturbations only consider searching locally around a few individual inputs, providing limited guarantees. We propose DeepSafe, a novel approach for automatically assessing the overall robustness of a neural network. DeepSafe applies clustering over known labeled data and leverages off-the-shelf constraint solvers to automatically identify and check safe regions in which the network is robust, i.e. all the inputs in the region are guaranteed to be classified correctly. We also introduce the concept of targeted robustness, which ensures that the neural network is guaranteed not to misclassify inputs within a region to a specific target (adversarial) label. We evaluate DeepSafe on a neural network implementation of a controller for the next-generation Airborne Collision Avoidance System for unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu) and for the well known MNIST network.

In this paper, we present a method for scoring the individual correspondences by exploiting semantic information about the query image and the scene. In this way, erroneous correspondences tend to get a low semantic consistency score, whereas correct correspondences tend to get a high score. By incorporating this information in a standard localization pipeline, we show that the localization performance can be significantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art, as evaluated on two challenging long-term localization benchmarks. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
"Protecting Secure Communication Under UAV Smart Attack With Imperfect Channel Estimation","2018","IEEE Access","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2880979","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056565552&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2018.2880979&partnerID=40&md5=0e0e06aef722fcf9f6ca592d80cd41e4","In this paper, we investigate a secure communication system, where one transmitter sends some confidential message to one receiver, under the smart attack from one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV utilizes the programmable radio devices to execute multiple attack types, such as eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing. We consider the practical communication scenarios where there are a limited number of pilot signals for channel estimation, and the channel estimation at the receiver side may be imperfect. To deal with the joint impact of smart attack and imperfect channel estimation, we use the non-cooperative game theory to propose a Q-learning-based power control algorithm in order to obtain an adaptive policy for the transmitter. In this algorithm, a Nash equilibrium strategy of the game under imperfect channel estimation is devised to maximize the utility of the transmitter and, meanwhile, suppress the smart attack from the UAV. The simulation results indicate that this strategy can effectively decrease the attack rate of the UAV attacker and increase the system secrecy capacity, regardless of the channel estimation accuracy. Moreover, the impact of the channel estimation error on the attack rate and secrecy capacity is also reflected. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Examples are modern road vehicles (assisted and autonomous driving), CPS road networks (car2x), power plants, smart grids and healthcare devices. However, due to the dynamic interconnection and the largely unpredictable number of possible system configurations the dependable cooperation of CPS can not be fully assured at design time. The malfunction of a CPS could threaten human life, cause environmental damage and major financial loss. In order to address these challenges, this paper presents an early excerpt of an ongoing holistic approach and toolchain architecture that supports the design, development, implementation, operation and maintenance of dependable CPS. The proposed approach uses the dependability information accumulated during the system specification process as an input configuration for self-adaptive systems. These self-adaptive systems then test and assure the dependability properties of the CPS throughout the whole system life cycle. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

One of these technologies are unmanned aerial vehicles. Success in armies meant an expansion into the civil sector. Requirements for rapid installation into an armament and costs as low as possible meant the usage of current aircraft engines without any further modifications. Especially in an effort to achieve maximal altitude of the vehicle the engine without the modification could be a cause of unsuccessful effort of exploitation of vehicle´s options. Simple analyses of the vehicles and their current propulsion systems were found significant elements of their interconnections. Then the currently appropriate propulsion systems were assigned with a choice justification and its possible alternatives, hazards, various advantages and so on. Then a type of the engine which has not been fully utilized on these vehicles yet was theoretically designed. The point that this engine has not been fully utilized on these vehicles is precisely why it could bring new benefits to this area. It could even outweigh the advantages of the engines currently used on these vehicles and potentially replace some of them. This part of the theoretical engine design is the subject of this article. © 2018 Kaunas University of Technology. All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The algorithms are based on template matching and morphological filtering, thus being able to operate within a wide range of relative distances (i.e., from a few meters up to several tens of meters), while ensuring robustness against variations of illumination conditions, target scale and background. Furthermore, the image processing chain takes full advantage of navigation hints (i.e., relative positioning and own-ship attitude estimates) to improve the computational efficiency and optimize the trade-off between correct detections, false alarms and missed detections. Clearly, the required exchange of information is enabled by the cooperative nature of the formation through a reliable inter-vehicle data-link. Performance assessment is carried out by exploiting flight data collected during an ad hoc experimental campaign. The proposed approach is a key building block of cooperative architectures designed to improve UAV navigation performance either under nominal GNSS coverage or in GNSS-challenging environments. © 2018 by the authors; Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we study secure transmission in a four-node (source, destination, mobile relay, and eavesdropper) system, wherein we focus on maximizing the secrecy rate via jointly optimizing the relay trajectory and the source/relay transmit power. Nevertheless, due to the coupling of the trajectory designing and the power allocating, the secrecy rate maximization problem is intractable to solve. Accordingly, we propose an alternating optimization approach, wherein the trajectory designing and the power allocating are tackled in an alternating manner. Unfortunately, the trajectory designing is a nonconvex problem, and thus, it is still hard to solve. To circumvent the nonconvexity, we exploit sequential convex programming to derive an iterative algorithm, which is proven to converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point of the trajectory design problem. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the joint power and trajectory design in improving the secrecy throughput. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, with the increase of the size of open source datasets, the potential threats to mining these datasets have also grown. As the dataset grows, it becomes gradually unrealistic for human to confirm quality of all samples. Some studies have investigated this problem and provided solutions to avoid threats in sample selection, but some of these solutions (e.g., finding development projects) require human intervention. When the amount of data to be processed increases, these semi-Automatic solutions become less useful since the effort in need for human intervention is far beyond affordable. To solve this problem, we investigated the GHTorrent dataset and proposed a method to detect public development projects. The results show that our method can effectively improve the sample selection process in two ways: (1) We provide a simple model to automatically select samples (with 0.827 precision and 0.947 recall); (2) We also offer a complex model to help researchers carefully screen samples (with 63.2% less effort than manually confirming all samples, and can achieve 0.926 precision and 0.959 recall). © 2018 Universitat zu Koln.

In this paper, we describe goals, development and first offering of a scaffolded course: “AuE 893 Autonomy: Science and Systems” to begin addressing this goal. Geared towards graduate engineering students, with limited prior exposure, the course complements the concepts from traditional courses (on mobile-robotics) with experiential hands-on system-integration efforts (building on the F1tenth.org kits). The staged course structure initially builds upon open-source Robotics Operating System (ROS) tutorials on simulated systems (Gazebo/RViz) with networked communication; Hardware-in-the-loop realization (with a Turtlebot platform) then aids the exploration (and reinforcement) of autonomy concepts. The course culminates in a final-project comprising performance testing with student-team integrated scaled Autonomous Remote Control cars (based on the F1tenth.org parts-list). All three student teams were successful in navigating around a closed racecourse at speeds of 10-15 miles per hour, using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for situational awareness and obstacle-avoidance.

Motion errors derive from platform flight deviation and unknown target velocity and estimating all motion errors once is difficult because both aspects influence each other, especially in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. We find that the platform flight deviation has the same effect on stationary targets and moving ones. Exploiting this similarity, we propose a novel ground moving target motion compensation method. Platform flight errors are extracted from stationary targets by autofocus algorithms and compensated for moving targets. And then Hough transform (HT) and Map-Drift (MD) technique is used to estimate the radial velocity and the along-track velocity, and range cell migration correction (RCMC) is completed by estimated velocities. Furthermore, PGA technique is adopted to estimate and correct residual phase errors.

The USVs are designed to attack the protected hostile target with a minimum loss that use the lower attack capacity and a small number of attack USVs to reach the target. The USVs attack problem could be viewed as a multi-constrained task assignment problem. In this study, a novel algorithm is proposed, which is called DAMGWO, a grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm based on distributed auction mechanism (DAM). This algorithm combines DAM and GWO algorithm to constrain the wolf initialization, increasing the ability to break away from the local optimum. Furthermore a corresponding fitness function to evaluate the quality of this algorithm is proposed.

As recently as this year, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) is examining initiatives for a next generation trauma care capability centered on autonomous, unmanned, and robotic solutions. While the ultimate goal of trauma care autonomy is to sustain life, the need still exists to extract wounded soldiers via VTOL aircraft. While estimates vary, Air Mobility Command Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) forces support approximately 20,000 combined fixed and rotary wing airlift movements annually. During Vietnam, AE was responsible for transporting 108,000 wounded soldiers from a combat zone to medical facilities. Intra-facility transport accounted for an additional 280,000 troop transports. Last year in the United States, civilian Helicopter Air Ambulance Operations (HAAO) account for the transport of over 500,000 patients annually. HAAO experience, while non-combatant, offers significant experience in operational processes and airlift requirements when there is an emergency involving immediate threat to life, limb, or sight. As military services are challenged with providing soldier location and extraction in austere and ever-increasing hostile environments, there has been numerous air vehicle design configurations proposed and even flight tested to meet the requirements. However, the operational procedures considering air vehicle and patient extraction can be extremely challenging for piloted flight and medical crews. Promising design solutions are a result of recent developments in electric VTOL (eVTOL) technologies. Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) solutions allow designers flexibility in locating propulsors and eliminating fossil fuel systems. These advancements result in structural designs that are more conducive to patient ingress and egress. In addition to structural design flexibility, eVTOL designs offer other benefits versus Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) counterparts to include reduced acoustic and thermal signatures and greater agility and maneuverability while eliminating the required pilot and aircrew resting periods during up-tempo operations. Autonomous air vehicle design considerations for Air Mobility Aeromedical Evacuation are developed based on HAA and US Armed Forces airlift experience with avionics, flight procedures, and air crew operations. © 2018 AHS International, Inc.

This is due, in large part to the now accessible price points while providing quality product for both commercial and personal use. By differing estimates, the market is growing anywhere from 40 to 60 percent year-over-year. Even by conservative estimates, the numbers can't be ignored. As these systems become increasingly prevalent in society, they have also become equally prevalent in use for unintended or ill-intended purposes. The utility of these devices is even outpacing the technology, as are the ways in which they are being adapted for egregious outcomes. This situation seems eerily similar to one that the militaries of the world encountered during the early 2000s, in the Middle East when the Improvised Explosive Device (or IED) became a household term. The military and research and development industries were put to task to react, while those that wished to do harm, were already plotting their next evolution. The major difference with this potential threat is that it is present domestically and abroad.

We study a pursuit-evasion game which takes place in a known polygonal environment. The goal of the pursuer is to capture the evader by moving onto its location. The players can observe each others' locations only if they can ""see"" each other - i.e., if the line segment connecting their locations lies entirely inside the polygonal environment. The complexity of representing the information available to the players at a given time makes solving pursuit-evasion games with visibility limitations difficult. We represent the state of the game using an efficient visibility-based decomposition of the environ-. ment paired with a more classical grid-based decomposition. The optimal players' strategies are computed using a min-max search algorithm improved with specific speedup techniques that preserve optimality. We show that our decomposition is complete for a rash evader, which hides from the pursuer and does not move from its hiding location when the pursuer is not visible. Simulations in realistic indoor environments and comparison with a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm validate our approach. © 2018 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

One such example is the use of long wave thermal infrared cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) to spot poachers at night and report them to park rangers before they are able to harm animals. However, monitoring the live video stream from these conservation UAVs all night is an arduous task. Therefore, we build SPOT (Systematic POacher deTector), a novel application that augments conservation drones with the ability to automatically detect poachers and animals in near real time. SPOT illustrates the feasibility of building upon state-of-the-art AI techniques, such as Faster RCNN, to address the challenges of automatically detecting animals and poachers in infrared images. This paper reports (i) the design and architecture of SPOT, (ii) a series of efforts towards more robust and faster processing to make SPOT usable in the field and provide detections in near real time, and (iii) evaluation of SPOT based on both historical videos and a real-world test run by the end users in the field. The promising results from the test in the field have led to a plan for larger-scale deployment in a national park in Botswana.

Pro-active threat emulation such as penetration testing or red teaming is the preferred means to address these threats especially when compared to reactive solutions which begin their life cycle post-exploitation. These offensive security assessments allow an organization to identify vulnerabilities that could be used by malicious actors. Although many security industry institutions label their products or services as addressing APTs unfortunately there is no agreed upon standard for how to properly do this. Additionally, academic efforts regarding APTs largely focus on monitoring which is reactive or automated assessment, which simulates only known attack sequences and doesn’t necessarily represent future attacks. This paper aims to provide a standard for addressing APT attacks by a new paradigm beginning offensive security assessments as the end goal of the APT and not by focusing on network access. Such an assessment counters the outcome of APT breaches by focusing on vulnerabilities that enable an actor to compromise the data most important to an organization locally and pivoting outwards to points used for access and exfiltration. When an organization identifies the critical items that represent unacceptable losses they should be protected as if an actor, regardless of motivation, were intent on compromising them. Adequate identification and then protection of critical items via offensive assessments originating at such positions represents an approach more efficient and capable of mitigating the overall impact of an APT breach. In a threat landscape with hyper-focused actors it is the responsibility of the security field to provide an equally focused security assessment solution beyond the attack simulations of traditional penetration test or red team engagement. This paper ratifies the validity of such a counter APT assessment paradigm through experimentation as well as case study. This unique combination of academic experimentation and industry implementation provides a proof of concept indicating that this novel approach to addressing advanced cyber threats is worth consideration as an augment to existing cyber security constructs. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

Due to the lack of actual combat experience and high confidentiality of the cyberspace operation and the UAV swarm operation, the modeling and simulation (M and S) of the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace is the vital method for planning the UAV swarm system architecture and designing the tactical methods of the UAV swarm. At present, the research on the M and S of the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace is just starting from home and abroad, and there is no corresponding modeling method and concrete model. Taken the Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) as the operational object, the guiding ideology of the M and S of the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace was researched from the height of the joint operations, which includes the characteristics of the individual autonomy, the group cooperation, the offensive and defensive antagonism and the electromagnetic-cyber the operation. Then, the model characteristic and elements was analyzed, such as the model system architecture, the operational rule and the intelligent algorithm. On this basis, the ""action model pool"", ""operational rule pool"" and ""intelligent algorithm pool"" would be constructed. Afterwards, the modeling method of the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace which based the ""Rule+ Respond+ Algorithm"" (RRA) is proposed, including the modeling framework and main process method of the RRA. The main process included the military concept modeling stage, the operational rules refining stage, the operational rules judgment stage, the action model response stage and the intelligent algorithm solution stage, that the five stages were in sequence, also the main work in each stage was analyzed. At the level of system of system M and S, the modeling focused of the abstraction, extraction and description of the operational rules of the UAV swarm in cyberspace. The description and construction methods of the operational rule are researched, such as the BNF format, the process format, and the operational rules tree graph. Finally, based on the future joint operations, an example of the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace is given, then the operational effectiveness is analyzed.

The advent of computed tomography angiography (CTA) has turned non-invasive diagnosis of cardiovascular anomalies into reality as calcified coronary plaques can be easily identified due to high intensity values. However, detection and quantification of the non-calcified plaques in CTA is still a challenging problem because of their lower intensity values, which are often similar to the nearby blood and muscle tissues. In this work, we propose Bayesian posterior based model for precise quantification of the non-calcified plaques in CTA imagery. The only indicator of non-calcified plaques in CTA is relatively lower intensity. Hence, we exploited intensity variations to discriminate voxels into lumen and plaque classes. Based on the normal coronary segments, we computed the vessel-wall thickness in first step. In the subsequent step, we removed vessel wall from the segmented tree and employed Gaussian Mixture Model to compute optimal distribution parameters. In the final step, distribution parameters were employed in Bayesian posterior model to classify voxels into lumen or plaque. A total of 18 CTA volumes were analyzed in this work using two different approaches. According to the experimental results, mean Jaccard overlap is around 88% with respect to the manual expert. In terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, the proposed method achieves 84.13%, 79.15% and 82.02% success, respectively. Conclusion: According to the experimental results, it is shown that the proposed plaque quantification method achieves accuracy equivalent to human experts. © 2018, (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this context, sea level rise, coastal retreat and storm surges pose serious threats to coastal zones. In order to assess the expected coastal changes for the next decades, a detailed knowledge of the site's topography (coastline position, DTM, bathymetry) is needed. This paper focuses on the use of very high resolution satellite data and UAV imagery for the generation of accurate very-high and ultra-high mapping of coastal areas. In addition, the use of very high resolution multi-spectral satellite data is investigated for the generation of coastal bathymetry maps. The paper presents a study for the island of Lipari and the coasts of Cinque Terre (Italy) and the island of Lefkas (Greece). For Lefkas, two areas of the island were mapped (the city of Lefkas and its adjoining lagoon in the north side of the island, and the Bay of Vasiliki at the south part of the island) using World View 1, and Wolrd View 3 satellite images, and UAV imagery. The satellite processing provided results that demonstrated an accuracy of approximately 0.25 m plannimetrically and 0.70 m vertically. The processing of the UAV imagery resulted in the generation of DTMs and orthophotos with an accuracy of approximately 0.03-0.04 meters. In addition, for the Vasiliki bay in the south of the island the World View 3 imagery was used for the estimation of a bathymetry map of the bay. The achieved results yielded an accuracy of 0.4 m. For the sites of Lipari and Cinque Terre (both in Italy), UAV surveys allowed to extract a DTM at about 2 cm of pixel resolution. The integration of topographic data with high resolution multibeam bathymetry and expected sea level rise from IPCC AR5 2.6 and 8.5 climatic scenarios, will be used to map sea level rise scenarios for 2050 and 2100, taking into account the Vertical Land Motion (VLM) as estimated from CGPS data.

Such use includes unauthorized surveillance, reconnaissance, and weaponization. Detecting adversarial UAVs in urban environments is difficult. Urban canyons provide shielding from visibility. The small size of quadcopter-type UAVs limits the number of object pixels available for processing, which reduces standoff detection performance. UAVs fly against a background of ground motion clutter which can mask their motion. One possible solution to small UAV detection in urban environments uses low-cost UAV surveillance platforms, equipped with optical sensors, together with computer vision algorithms to detect adversarial UAVs in video data. In this paper we adapt the astronomical technique of transit photometry to detect small UAVs, operating in urban environments, in video data. Transit photometry, typically used for exo-planet discovery, detects small changes in background brightness due to a transiting object. As the UAV traverses across a bright background region, for example, the vehicle occludes the background and reduces the perceived brightness. This brightness dip may be used to infer the existence of a potential UAV passing across the background. The transit photometry curve, resulting from this brightness dip, reveals information about the traversing vehicle. We investigate mathematical properties of the transit photometry curve and derive a closed-form expression for it. We present numerical results demonstrating the technique on real video data acquired from a small UAV operating in an urban environment. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

One such example is the use of thermal infrared cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) to spot poachers at night and report them to park rangers before they are able to harm any animals. However, monitoring the live video stream from these conservation UAVs all night is an arduous task. Therefore, we discuss SPOT (Systematic POacher deTector), a novel application that augments conservation drones with the ability to automatically detect poachers and animals in near real time [Bondi et al., 2018b]. SPOT illustrates the feasibility of building upon state-of-the-art AI techniques, such as Faster RCNN, to address the challenges of automatically detecting animals and poachers in infrared images. This paper reports (i) the design of SPOT, (ii) efficient processing techniques to ensure usability in the field, (iii) evaluation of SPOT based on historical videos and a real-world test run by the end-users, Air Shepherd, in the field, and (iv) the use of AirSim for live demonstration of SPOT.

Our approach exploits the contour detection based on the multi-scale wavelet transform for detecting the parasite. Active contours are combined with the Hough transform to perform image segmentation and extraction of the parasite. We used the principal component analysis for the extraction and reduction of features obtained directly from pixels of the extracted parasite image.

In the proposed algorithm, both dynamic threats and static obstacles are taken into account to generate an artificial field representing the environment for collision free path planning. To enhance the path searching efficiency, a coordinate transformation is applied to move the origin of the map to the starting point of the path and in line with the source-destination direction. Cost functions are established to represent the dynamically changing threats, and the cost value is considered as a scalar value of mobile threats which are vectors actually. In the process of searching for an optimal moving direction for UAV, the cost values of path, mobile threats, and total cost are optimized using ant optimization algorithm.

The network is autonomous and, hence, requires a wide range of security measures to protect its communications from attack. Recent studies on VANET security have focused on resolving the issues due to computation and distribution density of the vehicles. Probability distribution measures have been administered for detecting collision attacks, which increases the computational complexity. In this paper, a trust-based distributed authentication (TDA) method that relies on a global trust server and vehicle behavior for avoiding collision attacks is proposed. This method ensures both inter-vehicular and intra-vehicular communication security in the network. In addition, a channel state routing protocol (CSRP) is proposed to improve the communication reliability among the vehicles. Reliable vehicles are identified according to the on-board unit (OBU) energy and the channel state of the vehicle to deliver seamless communication. The biased methods are assimilated to improve the communication reliability by avoiding collision attacks and improving secured packets flow in VANETs. In particular, the CSRP minimizes the energy exploitation of OBUs and time delay. TDA improves the security of the network by improving the collision recognition rate and the broadcast rate. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To improve aerodynamic performance and optimize flight attitude control, the authors developed a set of circulation-control actuators (CCAs) based on circulation-control (CC) technology to replace the conventional rudder surface and applied these CCAs to a flight test of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The authors measure the main characteristic parameters of the CCAs and the flow-field characteristics, which indicate that the CCAs can suppress separation and delay stall at high angles of attack. An experimental assessment of rudder efficiency shows that the CCAs can produce the rudder efficiency required for conventional flight attitude control. Specifically, the maximum roll rudder efficiency that the CCA generates is equivalent to an aileron deflection of 50°, and the maximum pitch rudder efficiency is equivalent to an elevator deflection of 10° at a speed of 10 m/s.

The horizontal and vertical separations between the tandem wings are key design parameters for the current convertiplane configuration and are systematically identified through experiments performed in NWTF wind tunnel at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. For this a “half model” of the actual UAV wing is fabricated using 3D printing and tested at different wind speeds and angles-of-attack. For the baseline horizontal separation of 50% of wingspan and no vertical separation the ideal combination of wing setting angle is identified to be 3◦ for fore wing and 6◦ for the aft wing, as this combination offsets the downwash effect of fore wing on the aft wing with increased angle-of-attack and also takes advantage of the upwash of the aft wing to enhance the lift on the fore wing. A horizontal spacing equal to at least 50% of span is observed to give good performance for both the fore and aft wings. The vertical separation enhances the lift on the aft wing significantly. A vertical spacing of 30% of the wingspan helps minimize the interference between the wings and the propellers. Copyright © 2018 by AHS International, Inc.

And today the importance of UAVs is also increasing for civil applications such as transporting, agricultural spraying etc. These kind of civil applications are expected to require more power and different propeller geometries to provide higher payload capacities. In this context, aerial vehicle's propeller size and pitch are important parameters in order to obtain proper lifting capacity for Vertical Take-off and Landing (VToL) UAVs. There is a number of terms to define the propeller's specifications such as diameter, pitch, disc area relation, bore, material type etc. These characteristics must be calculated to design the optimal propeller accordingly to match specific needs of aerial vehicle characteristics. It is very important that both angle of attack and diameter should properly be investigated to be able to choose optimal propeller. The effect of angle of attack dominates characteristics of the propellers and in turn, aerial vehicles.

Then, the developed beamformer is extended to the dynamic case considering the Doppler effects, referred to as the frequency extended JRSB (FE-JRSB), achieving the potential maximum output signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) by exploiting the information across the potential frequencies of interest jointly. The output signal of the beamformer with increased SINR can be used to assist the extended target detection in the following processing. Simulation results show that both are able to extract the signals of interest while suppressing interfering signals, and a lower mean square error and a higher output SINR are achieved compared with a regular reference signal-based beamformer using a single sub-array. One unique feature of the provided solutions is that, although the signals involved are narrowband, the employed beamforming structure has to be wideband for it to be effective. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This paper focuses on developing a method for detecting UAV sensor faults by using existing sensors, such as pitot tube, gyro, accelerometer and wind angle sensor. We formulate the kinematics as a nonlinear state space system, which requires no dynamic information and thus is applicable to all aircraft. To illustrate the method, we investigate five fault-detection scenarios, namely, faulty pitot tube, angle-of-attack sensor, sideslip sensor, accelerometer and gyro, and design a FDI structure including five faulty sensors. Then, considering the unknown disturbance, the proportional and multiple integral (PMI) fault detection filter (FDF) is proposed for the state and input estimation. A structure including two residuals are employed to detect and isolate the faults of the proposed faulty sensors. Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated through flight experiments of the UAV. © 2018","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

There is an uprising interest in the development of advanced path planning algorithms for marine vehicles in congested waterways. Availability of an efficient path planning technique that considers the dynamic capabilities of the vehicle is of paramount importance in the implementation of these algorithms. This article reports an early work which aims to contribute to the development of a new generation of path planning that incorporates in its formulation the dynamics of the vehicles and extra data made available by on board sensors about obstacles and other vehicles in vicinity. To this end, Bézier Curves are exploited as the basis for generating a rich set of paths. Then, differential flatness property of the vehicle is used to assign a cost function to each path that reflects the dynamic capabilities of the vehicle on that path. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is shown by help of numerical simulations. © 2018","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The level of autonomy depends upon the make-up and degree of sensor sophistication and the vehicle’s operational application, which can range from extremely high cost military-based combat vehicles, to commercially available civilian motor vehicles and very low-cost sub $100 hobby drones. As a result, the risk of autonomous vehicles being compromised and used as an improvised threat has become more serious and therefore trust-based methods to mitigate them are needed. This paper reviews the relationship between cyber-physical systems, automated and autonomous vehicles and their trustworthiness. It examines the significant role cyber-physical systems play in building sub-system, system, and system-of-system layers found in contemporary vehicles as well as the level of human involvement in decision control loops, and the trustworthiness challenges this creates across levels of vehicle automation and autonomy. Further, the paper reviews material on methods to authenticate a vehicle’s “world-view” and the veracity of information it may communicate and share with other vehicles and infrastructure. It finds that to be trustworthy, automated and autonomous vehicles will need to implement data verification frameworks and methods. It recommends that future research be conducted into the effectiveness of implementing a pervasive trustworthiness hub where information flowing between heterogeneous autonomous vehicles and infrastructure within their surrounding environment can be authenticated. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

The autonomous features are proven to be helpful in reducing road fatalities globally. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), a system which helps the driving process automation, has growing roles in recent road vehicle features. It is the base for the development of a fully autonomous vehicle. One of the main features of ADAS is Collision Avoidance (CA) system. A sufficient CA architecture usually encompasses threat assessment, path planning and path tracking strategies. There are many ways of developing precise CA architecture using the combination of these strategies. This paper aims to review current available methods for CA as an introductory idea for researchers who are new to this field. Each of the methods in each strategy is categorised into several groups. Their advantages and drawbacks are discussed. In addition to that, several improvement suggestions for a comprehensive CA system were highlighted.

Two critical hazards with UAV operations are considered and analyzed, which are ground impacts and midair collisions. Threats to fatalities that result from the two hazards are the focus in the proposed method. In order to realize ground impact assessment, a multifactor risk model is designed by calculating system reliability required to meet a target level of safety for different UAV categories. Both fixed-wing and rotary-wing UAVs are taken into account under a real scenario that is further partitioned into different zones to make the evaluation more precise. Official territory and population data of the operation scenario are incorporated, as well as UAV self-properties. Casualty area of impacting debris can be obtained as well as the probability of fatal injuries on the ground. Sheltering factors are not neglected and defined as four types based on the real scenario. When midair collision fatality risk is estimated, a model of aircraft collisions based on the density of civil flight in different regions over Chinese airspace is proposed. In the model, a relative collision area and flying speed between UAVs and manned aircraft are constructed to calculate expected frequency of fatalities for each province correspondingly. Truthful data with different numbers of UAVs is incorporated in the model with the expected number of fatalities after a collision is included. Experimental simulations are made to evaluate the ground impacts and midair collisions when UAVs operate in the NAS. © 2018 Xuejun Zhang et al.","Article","Final","Scopus"

They deliver a more complete view of what is happening around the car. Human drivers also heavily exploit their mental map for navigation. Nonetheless, several methods have been published that learn driving models with only a front-facing camera and without a route planner. This lack of information renders the self-driving task quite intractable. We investigate the problem in a more realistic setting, which consists of a surround-view camera system with eight cameras, a route planner, and a CAN bus reader. In particular, we develop a sensor setup that provides data for a 360-degree view of the area surrounding the vehicle, the driving route to the destination, and low-level driving maneuvers (e.g. steering angle and speed) by human drivers. With such a sensor setup we collect a new driving dataset, covering diverse driving scenarios and varying weather/illumination conditions. Finally, we learn a novel driving model by integrating information from the surround-view cameras and the route planner. Two route planners are exploited: (1) by representing the planned routes on OpenStreetMap as a stack of GPS coordinates, and (2) by rendering the planned routes on TomTom Go Mobile and recording the progression into a video. Our experiments show that: (1) 360-degree surround-view cameras help avoid failures made with a single front-view camera, in particular for city driving and intersection scenarios; and (2) route planners help the driving task significantly, especially for steering angle prediction.

This paper is the first report of a large-scale survey that we carried out among bull sires under the ecological conditions of Ural region to estimate production of endogenous hormones estradiol and testosterone, and their precursor cholesterol, as depending on the bull age, origin (Denmark, Netherlands, Russia, the USA, France, and Germany), the milk performance of their maternal ancestors, and the titers of anti-sperm antibodies. The relationship between the endogenous hormones and the studied parameters is ascertained, and it is found that the synthesis of steroid sex hormones is sustainable even at low level of blood cholesterol. Our objective was to assay concentration of blood hormones and the titers of anti-sperm antibodies in 56 bull sires including 49 Black-and-White Holsteins and 7 Black-and-White animals of different origin aged from 24 to 91 months which are exploited in the Ural Regional Information and Breeding Center (UralPlemCenter, Sverdlovsk Province, 2016-2017). The blood serum hormones were measured by ELISA with testosterone Immuna-FA-TC and Immuna-FA-Estradiol kits (Immunotech, Russia). The ratios of testosterone to estradiol were calculated. The cholesterol level was assayed with a ChemWell 2902 automated analyzer (Awareness Technology, Inc., USA). The autoantibody titers were detected in the sperm immobilization test with blood auto serum of the bull sires and Guinea pig serum complement. The obtained results were processed depending on the country of origin, the bull age, and the retrospective data on milk productivity of the bulls' mothers (M), the mothers' mothers (MM), and the fathers' mothers (FM). The highest (30.7 nmol/l) and the lowest (13.4 nmol/l and 10.7 nmol/l) concentrations of testosterone had the Danish, Holland and French bull sires, respectively. It is found that the testosterone level was rising to five-year age and eventually reached 26.9 nmol/l vs. 9.6 nmol/l in two-year old animals. The blood concentrations of testosterone and estradiol inversely correlated. The testosterone to estradiol ratio significantly varied (P < 0.001). The lowest testosterone concentration (15.4 nmol/l) was in hyperestrogenization, and the indicator value reached 25.1 nmol/l in the animals with low estrogens. The testosterone to estradiol ratio (T/E) increased with the age, from 0.4 at 28 months of age up to 19.3 at 50 months, by a statistically significant value (P < 0.001). No significant relationship was revealed between the endogenous hormone concentrations in the bulls and the milk performance of their maternal ancestors, except some effect of the father's mothers with milk yield of 12000 to 16000 kg. An increase in the sperm autoantibody titer was accompanied by the decreases in the serum testosterone and estradiol levels by 37.9 % and 4.6 %, respectively. The cholesterol level increased by 13.7 %. Changes between the groups were within the normative range. Therefore, the concentration of the endogenous hormones (testosterone and estradiol) depends on the sire age and origin. The test for anti-sperm antibodies during clinical andrological examination is diagnostically important to indirectly characterize the hormonal status of sires. © 2018 Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

The collaborative trajectory planning model which is based on avoiding the threat zones, reducing the execution time, and accomplishing the mission combines kinematics/dynamics model of UCAV with formation relative motion model to establish the optimal control problem. The approach based on hp adaptive pseudospectral method is presented to generate formation trajectory that satisfies the collaborative constraints. When a trigger event is detected, based on the offline planning, the online collaborative trajectory replanning using rolling horizon strategy is carried out.

Regulators still follow policies from the pre-software safety assurance era. Eight general areas of contrast between accepted safety principles and observed automotive safety practices are identified.

Indeed, this environment is no longer used only for the exchange of textual data, but also transactional and multimedia such as gaming, video on demand, and IPTV. Therefore, in parallel with the diversity of flow, there is an improvement in network infrastructure. The Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms make it possible, among other things, to optimize the consumption of network resources, by favoring certain flows over the others according to specific policies. One of the big challenges to overcome when setting up QoS mechanisms is sizing the network, that is, ensuring that the mechanism and reservation are chosen correctly to meet the customer's requirements and not causing any deterioration in network performance. Simulation is one of the preliminary phases to be carried out before applying the various QoS mechanisms in a digital network. In general, QoS simulation projects, under Riverbed Modeler or other simulators, contain hundreds or even thousands of scenarios. This makes the simulation difficult, tedious, and especially vulnerable to errors related to the human factor involving the confidence interval of the results obtained. In this paper, we propose a new 2AFM-QoS (Assisted Automated for Fast Modeling Quality of Service) approach for automating the simulation of QoS mechanisms in an intelligent digital environment under Riverbed Modeler. The 2AFM-QoS approach is validated by a new Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool facilitating its exploitation. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

These vehicles are becoming more reliant on external communication through vehicular ad hoc networks. However, these networks contribute new threats to self-driving vehicles which lead to potentially significant problems in autonomous systems. These communication systems potentially open self-driving vehicles to malicious attacks like the common Sybil attacks, black hole, Denial of Service, wormhole attacks and grey hole attacks. In this paper, an intelligent protection mechanism is proposed, which was created to secure external communications for self-driving and semi-autonomous cars. The protection mechanism is based on the Proportional Overlapping Scores method, which allows to decrease the number of features found in the Kyoto benchmark dataset. This hybrid detection system uses Back Propagation neural networks to detect Denial of Service (DoS), a common type of attack in vehicular ad hoc networks. The results from our experiment revealed that the proposed intrusion detection has the ability to identify malicious vehicles in self-driving and even in semi-autonomous vehicles. © 2018 The Author(s).

The main factor that affects the quality of these processes is competent employees. Their knowledge, skills and ability to respond to unexpected situations largely determine the efficiency of the functioning of the technical infrastructure in an enterprise. In the light of the prospects for the development of the Industry 4.0 concept, and, thus, for the development of highly automated systems, the demand for qualified maintenance employees will increase. Therefore, in order to ensure the right level of competency of maintenance workers, through the proper assessment and identification of their competency gap, is an important task of managers. In many enterprises this is not implemented. The aim of the presented work was to developed a comprehensive model of the competency assessment of maintenance workers. The implementation of the developed model enables the identification of the current level of employees’ competencies and identification of the competency gap, as well as it allows to assess the effects of a failure to meet the required level of competency. Additionally, the results of the identification of the real activities taken by the surveyed enterprises concerning the competency assessment of maintenance services employees are presented in this article.

Existing response systems are vulnerable to saturation attacks of large swarms of low-cost autonomous vehicles. One method of reducing this threat is the use of an intelligent counter swarm with tactics, navigation and planning capabilities for engaging the adversarial swarm. Though previous studies exist that have produced libraries of basic fighter tactics employable by unmanned fixed-wing aircraft, we are aware of little prior work that explores close-in tactical engagements at a large scale (teams of at least size 10). We examine existing technologies that can be applied in fixed-wing swarm-versus-swarm engagement, including classic pursuit-evasion strategies and the application of Lanchester's laws for attrition calculations. Our recent studies center on lever- A ging existing manned fighter combat doctrine, and on the benefits of collaboration. We consider experiments in close-air combat against adversaries capable of destroying aerial targets. The following work employs both a Monte Carlo analysis in a simulation environment to measure the effectiveness of several autonomous tactics, as well as an analysis of live flight experiments in swarm competitions with up to 10 vs. 10 scenarios. © 2018 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Furthermore, we propose an overlap criterion and select potentially matching view pairs between projective transformed views. A robust global structure from motion method is used for image based reconstruction. Our real world experiments show that the approach is accurate, scalable and computationally efficient. Moreover, projective transformations between views can also be used to eliminate false matching. © 2018 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, in non-cooperative situations these unique characteristics are often disturbed. In this study, we examine the effect of six different factors on face detection in an unconstrained imaging environment: Image brightness, image contrast, focus measure, eyewear, gender, and occlusion. The aim of this study is twofold: First, to quantify detection rates of conventional Haar cascade algorithms across these six factors; and second, to propose methods for automatically labeling datasets whose size prohibits manual labeling. First, we manually classify a uniquely challenging dataset comprising 9,688 images of passengers in vehicles acquired from a roadside camera system. Next, we quantify how each of the aforementioned factors affect face detection on this dataset. Of the six factors studied, occlusion had the most significant impact, resulting in a 54% decrease in detection rate between unoccluded and severely occluded faces in our unique dataset. Finally, we provide a methodology for data analytics of large datasets where manual labeling of the whole dataset is not possible. © 2018 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In recent years, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) segmentation methods have demonstrated advantages for abdominal organ segmentation. However, variations in both size and shape of the spleen on MRI images may result in large false positive and false negative labeling when deploying DCNN based methods. In this paper, we propose the Splenomegaly Segmentation Network (SSNet) to address spatial variations when segmenting extraordinarily large spleens. SSNet was designed based on the framework of image-to-image conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN). Specifically, the Global Convolutional Network (GCN) was used as the generator to reduce false negatives, while the Markovian discriminator (PatchGAN) was used to alleviate false positives. A cohort of clinically acquired 3D MRI scans (both T1 weighted and T2 weighted) from patients with splenomegaly were used to train and test the networks. The experimental results demonstrated that a mean Dice coefficient of 0.9260 and a median Dice coefficient of 0.9262 using SSNet on independently tested MRI volumes of patients with splenomegaly. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Accurate reconstruction of myocardial scar geometry is important for diagnosis and clinicial prognosis of the patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The 3D late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) is increasingly being investigated for assessing myocardial tissue viability. For applications, such as computational modeling of cardiac electrophysiology aimed at stratifying patient risk for post-infarction arrhythmias, segmentation and reconstruction of the intact geometry of scar is required. However, manual analysis and segmentation of myocardial scar from 3D LGE-MRI is a tedious task. Therefore, semi-automated and fully-automated segmentation algorithms are highly desirable in a clinical setting. In this study, we developed an approach to segment the myocardial scar from 3D LGE-MR images using a continuous max-flow (CMF) method. The data term comprised of a distribution matching term for scar and normal myocardium and a boundary smoothness term for the scar boundaries. The region-of-interest for the scar segmentation is constrained, using manually segmented myocardium. We evaluated our CMF method for accuracy by comparing it to manual scar delineations using 3D LGE-MR images of 34 patients. We compare the results of the CMF technique to ones by conventional full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) and signal-threshold-to-reference-mean (STRM) methods. The CMF method yielded a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 72±18% and an absolute volume error (V E) of 15.42±14.1 cm3. Overall, the CMF method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods for all reported metrics in 3D scar segmentation except for the recall value which STRM 2-SD performed better than CMF on average. © 2018 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

During these missions, they might face complex environments with many obstacles, sharp corners, and deadlocks. Thus, an obstacle avoidance strategy that allows them to successfully navigate in such environments is needed. Different obstacle avoidance techniques have been developed. Most of them require complex sensors (like vision or a sensor array) and high computational power. In this study, we propose an alternative approach that uses two simple ultrasonic-based distance sensors and neural control with synaptic plasticity for adaptive obstacle avoidance. The neural control is based on a two-neuron recurrent network. Synaptic plasticity of the network is done by an online correlation-based learning rule with synaptic scaling. By doing so, we can effectively exploit changing neural dynamics in the network to generate different turning angles with short-term memory for a drone. As a result, the drone can fly around and adapt its turning angle for avoiding obstacles in different environments with a varying density of obstacles, narrow corners, and deadlocks. Consequently, it can successfully explore and navigate in the environments without collision. The neural controller was developed and evaluated using a physical simulation environment. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

We propose an online, fully automated, end-to-end system for denoising time series data. Our model for denoising time series is trained using unpaired training corpora and does not need information about the source of the noise or how it is manifested in the time series.

A non-linear regressor deep neural network is trained to predict holistic scores on a scale of 10–60.

The accuracy of AUASs detection is of great significance. In this paper, we propose a novel surveillance framework which leverages Surveillance Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUASs) to detect AUASs. The approximate position of an AUAS is first estimated by Ground Surveillance Nodes (GSNs) with radio receivers, and SUASs are then activated to determine its precise position. Different from previous research, this framework not only leverages both ground and aerial surveillance capabilities, but also integrates both radio and image processing techniques, thus achieving enhanced AUAS detection capability.

Propeller-induced flow effects in both tractor and pusher configurations on a rectangular wing using the Wortmann FX 63-137 airfoil (a common low-Reynolds-number high-lift airfoil) are presented in this paper. Significant performance benefits can be found for a wing in the tractor configuration. Experiments, including trip tests and upper-surface oil flow visualization, show and verify that the propeller slipstream induces early transition to turbulent flow in the regions within the slipstream and the premature formation of a separation bubble in the regions outside the slipstream. The result is a reduction of pressure drag and an increase in lift of the wing where lift-to-drag ratios are as high as 10-12 (a maximum of 70% increase in lift-to-drag ratio from a clean wing configuration) and are measured at both low and high angles of attack up to stall (0-16 deg). Similar performance benefits are not observed in pusher configuration results where only increased local flow velocity and varying inflow angle effects are apparent. Thus, contrary to the design rules for optimal performance of wings at high Reynolds numbers, at low Reynolds numbers, a propeller in the tractor configuration exhibits significant performance improvements, especially in cruise configurations (low angles of attack), as compared with a propeller in the pusher configuration or even a clean wing.

This problem can be overcome by deploying and operating a range of high-performance sensors mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). For an initial survey and subsequently detailed reconnaissance of disaster areas where radiation sources represent a threat for rescue operations, the following specialized equipment can be used: the RIEGL VUX-1UAV laser scanner, a highly sensitive gamma radiation probe provided by CBRN Protection and the RiCOPTER-M UAV. An embedded processing and radio communication system integrated onboard the UAV enables real-time access to georeferenced 3D LiDAR pointclouds and gamma radiation levels. Precise localization of the gamma radiation sources and simulation of corresponding radiation activity patterns is achieved by automatic processing on the ground, taking the up-to-date topography into account. The results are displayed to the person in charge of response forces in an intuitive and user-friendly way on, e.g., a tablet computer in real-time and while the UAV is still in the air. Resolution and precision are continuously increased by a semi-autonomous flight path generation approach. This takes into account real-time radiation measurements in order to fly additional lines over automatically detected locations of specific interest.

Recent developments in technology, as well as growing political acceptance of autonomous systems, would likely support the immediate use of autonomous drones to enhance the situational awareness of first responders. The paper goes further, however, and makes a theoretical case for disrupting terrorist attacks with a micro-UAV armed with less than lethal weapons, like a stun gun, and eventually for using lethal force once such systems are proven to be cyber-secure. Assuring that such a system would be trustworthy and correctly engage only active shooters is likely within the cyber capabilities of the United States, its NATO partners and other allies. Currently, however, it is not clear that international acceptance would meet even a demonstrably cyber-secure “killer mini-drone”. How might we trust taser-armed micro-UAVs to wake up to the sound of gunshots and then identify and neutralize an active shooter within seconds, without zapping an innocent bystander? Promise lies with “neuromorphic” computing systems, which have benefitted from neuroscience-informed projects like the U.S. DARPA “Synapse” project and are currently amazing the world as drivers for IBM’s Watson (True North chip) and Google’s DeepMind system. Despite the promise of the technology, any system would have to be assessed in the context of the law of armed conflict, as well as the laws and culture of the countries involved.

"Modelling misbehaviour in automated vehicle intersections in a synthetic environment","2018","Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ICCWS 2018","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051717048&partnerID=40&md5=861e0dc84d11e91e67fc93efaf949a78","Fully autonomous vehicles will need to safely and securely interoperate with infrastructure, such as intersections, in the very near future. Secure communication between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) will be essential to managing intersections in a safe and efficient way. For shared resources, such as intersections where travel is inherently permitted in multiple directions within the same space, a management paradigm is the basis of safe time sharing. One such paradigm is the Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) algorithm. This algorithm has been proven in simulation to be a scalable, safe, and efficient intersection manager when compared to today’s exclusively human operated vehicles and our common intersection signal method of traffic control. AIM uses the notion of issuing reservations to autonomous vehicles prior to the vehicles’ passage through an intersection. However, missing in this AIM architecture is the concept of non-compliance of the fully autonomous vehicles. Non-compliance is the result of an actor not fulfilling its intended action, malicious or otherwise. The main focus of this paper is the attempt to offer realistic scenarios to motivate and illustrate the need for mitigations against a number of cybersecurity concerns with an intersection manager. To offer the heightened realism, the simulations will be performed in a three-dimensional virtual world using the Open Dynamics Engine to provide the realistic environment. The algorithm used in this paper is a modified version of AIM to fit the synthetic virtual environment. To illustrate noncompliance, the introduction of a malicious actor, vehicle or otherwise, will be made to disrupt the traffic flow. To be presented is the impact on efficiency and safety when an attack, such as a denial of service of a Sybil attack, is executed on the autonomous intersection. In addition, the efficiency and safety implications of introducing a human driver, completely void of any V2I capability, into the autonomous intersection will be explored. Even today, one can assume the presence of malicious actors to cause disruptions in the cyber domain. The purpose of this paper is to identify possible mitigation techniques for anticipated cyber-physical threats on human safety and public infrastructure in the realm of V2I communications. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

Due to the complex running environment of UAS, many factors are difficult to predict accurately in the development process. Therefore, it is of great significance to adopt an effective runtime security and safety guarantee mechanism. This paper proposes a UAS security and safety threat detection method based on runtime verification. Firstly, after analyzing a variety of security and safety threats that UAS may encounter, the paper defines the threats in discrete-time MTL and presents the corresponding UAS-DL language to describe the security and safety monitoring specification. Then an automatic generation algorithm of security and safety threat monitor is introduced based on the alternating automaton, and security and safety monitoring of multi-UAS is implemented by parameterization method. In order to improve the accuracy of the detection, the method of combining runtime verification with Bayesian network inference is also studied. The experiment is carried out with the actual UAS development simulation platform Ardupilot, and monitors are deployed on the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware independently to avoid excessive usage of UAS computing resources. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively detect the security and safety threats of UAS. © Copyright 2018, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Unmanned aerial vehicle follows approach phase, glide slope phase and flare phases during auto landing maneuver. This auto landing unmanned aerial vehicle encounters another unmanned aerial vehicle which comes across its glide path and poses a threat of possible collision. The other vehicle is termed as an ‘obstacle’ for the auto landing vehicle. The prediction logic is used to compute the minimum distance between two vehicles. If the minimum predicted distance is less than a predefined safety distance then the possible collision is predicted. The collision cone based approach is used to compute the aiming point. The velocity vector is deflected using guidance strategies to reach the aiming point. The differential geometric guidance is used to reach the aiming point in the available time to go. The auto landing vehicle senses the obstacle approaching towards it through stereo vision sensing and performs a collision avoidance maneuver. During collision avoidance maneuver, auto landing vehicle changes its speed as well as direction. However, the speed reduction is subjected to stall speed of the vehicle. The non cooperative scenario is considered where only the auto landing vehicle performs the collision avoidance and the obstacle follows its nominal path. The cooperative scenario is also considered where both the vehicles perform collision avoidance maneuver and rejoin their respective path post collision avoidance maneuver. The six degree of freedom model of both the unmanned aerial vehicles is used for simulation. © 2018","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This project deals with an UAV (ornithopter) with morphed wing, in which the wing can be foldable to increase the gliding speed. By using such type of wings, endurance and range can be increased. A laboratory scale ornithopter with flapping wing mechanism is fabricated and tested. The flight speed of almost 45mph can be achieved. This mechanism reduces the battery consumption, for e.g. for 8V input, 4 flaps per second is demonstrated by test. UAV has the ability to attack enemy territory without being identified by the RADAR.

Although this is good, UAVs bear the physical risks of aircrafts as well as those of unmanned systems. Taken into account the exponentially increasing number of UAVs (i.e., there will be approximately 1.26 million UAVs in Germany by 2018), these risks are becoming more likely to occur. In addition to operational risks, there are also security related risks. UAVs are typically remotely controlled, which, in turn, opens ways for cyber-attacks (e.g., denial of service or taking over control). In this paper we demonstrate that taking over control of commercially available UAVs is feasible and simple. In detail, we examine and analyze a standard UAV communication and control protocol (i.e., the DSM protocol family by Spektrum Inc.). We discuss common approaches for attacks, minor observations, and associated security vulnerabilities of this protocol. Since the number of commercially available communication components is small, these findings can easily be ported to other protocols such as (HOTT, S-FHSS, FrSky, and others).

Similar manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) capabilities have been successfully fielded in the AH-64E attack helicopter, with the Copilot/Gunner (CPG) managing one UAS; however, managing multiple UAS in the same manner would result in a cognitive processing bottleneck within the CPG. Removing this bottleneck requires implementation of autonomous behaviors and human-centered design principles to avoid detracting from the CPG's primary mission. This research evaluates these concepts with respect to multi-UAS MUM-T performance. Sixteen U.S. Army aviators with MUM-T experience participated in the experiment. The first phase assessed the performance of a CPG managing multiple UAS simultaneously in a fixed-base MUM-T simulator featuring touchscreen displays, simulated aided target recognition, and task-level delegation of control (DelCon). The second phase iteratively improved the DelCon capability and added an Attention Allocation Aid (AAA) in the form of real-time gaze tracking feedback. The research demonstrated that a single crewmember can manage at least three UAS assets while executing complex multi- UAS MUM-T tactical missions. The DelCon capability allowed participants to more efficiently perform a subset of mission tasks. Furthermore, subjective ratings from the participants indicated a willingness to accept the AAA and DelCon systems.

This is the essence of artificial Embodied Cognition, in which machine intelligence is tightly coupled to sensors and effectors and where learning happens from continually experiencing the dynamic world as time-series data, received and processed from a situated and contextually-relative perspective. From this stream, our engineered agents must perceptually discriminate, deal with noise and uncertainty, recognize the causal influence of their actions (sometimes with significant and variable temporal lag), pursue multiple and changing goals that are often incompatible with each other, and make decisions under time pressure. To further complicate matters, unpredictability caused by the actions of other adaptive agents makes this experiential data stochastic and statistically non-stationary. Reinforcement Learning approaches to these problems often oversimplify many of these aspects, e.g., by assuming stationarity, collapsing multiple goals into a single reward signal, using repetitive discrete training episodes, or removing real-time requirements. Because we are interested in developing dependable and trustworthy autonomy, we have been studying these problems by retaining all these inherent complexities and only simplifying the agent’s environmental bandwidth requirements. The Multi-Agent Research Basic Learning Environment (MARBLE) is a computational framework for studying the nuances of cooperative, competitive, and adversarial learning, where emergent behaviors can be better understood through carefully controlled experiments. In particular, we are using it to evaluate a novel reinforcement learning long-term memory data structure based on probabilistic suffix trees.

Engineering arguments are multidisciplinary and have a number of characteristics. A significant component of these decisions is science-based and may deploy sophisticated engineering calculations, mathematical models, simulations of the world and the engineered systems. However, this does not mean the judgments are purely deductive or logical. The framing of the problems, the validation of the assumptions, the application of “stopping rules” to decide when there is sufficient confidence is often an exercise in expert judgement. The overall process is socio-technical with challenge necessary to build confidence, and seeking dissent and counter-evidence important. One contribution to achieving confidence in engineering decisions is assurance cases: “a documented body of evidence that provides a convincing and valid argument that a system is adequately dependable for a given application in a given environment”. Our approach is based on the key concepts of claims, arguments and evidence (CAE): Claims—statements about a property of the system, Evidence that is used as the basis of the justification of the claim, Arguments link the evidence to the claim. Engineering justifications are too complex to express in terms of a simple CAE triple. If we are developing a top down justification, the claims need to be expanded into subclaims until we can identify evidence that can directly support the subclaims. Engineering assurance arguments tend to be some 10 s to 100 s of nodes and have considerable supporting narrative. We have developed an approach to structuring such arguments based on a set of archetypal CAE fragments that we have termed CAE building blocks. The identification of the blocks was supported by an empirical analysis of the types of engineering arguments that are made about safety and dependability from defence, finance and medical applications. Our approach factors out the argument into parts that can be addressed deductively and the side-warrant, which highlights the properties assumed of the world and have an inductive component.

These two aspects: the use of CAE fragments and the factorisation of deductive and inductive allow us to speculate how we can best exploit a variety of automated reasoning approaches. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To protect low-cost commercial off the shelf (COTS) receivers when spoofing attack occurs, an effective countermeasure is to locate the spoofer and somehow deactivate the spoofer. To this end, in this paper, a prototype system for spoofer localization is developed, in which the time of arrival (TOA) based localization technique is used. The system consists of four stand-alone GNSS receivers, which are connected via wireless communication modules for data collection. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of this system, a spoofing attack is considered where the spoofing signal can be detected and identified by receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM). Then, the spoofer is located by measuring the TOAs of the spoofing signal upon arriving at the four receivers. A series of field tests are carried out and demonstrate the feasibility of the system. Moreover, the factors that influence the performance of the system are also analyzed and validated by the field tests. © 2018, The Institute of Navigation, Inc.

A criminal employee of a caterer could infect the foods which poison part of the home health care patients and some valid people. To face such threat, the home health care structure has planned to collaborate with conventional hospitals to better care people during the acute and recovery phases of the infection, in the framework of an emergency management plan.

However, the WLANs still face persistent challenge on increasing the network throughput to meet the customer's requirement and fight against the node mobility. Interference is a well-known issue that would degrade the network performance due to the broadcast characteristics of the wireless signals. Moreover, with infrastructure mobility, the interference becomes the key obstacle in pursuing the channel capacity. Legacy interference management mechanism through the channel access control in the MAC layer design of the 802.11 standard has some well-known drawbacks, such as exposed and hidden terminal problems, inefficient rate adaptation, and retransmission schemes, making the efficient interference management an everlasting research topic over the years. Recently, interference management through exploiting physical layer mechanisms has attracted much research interest and has been proven to be a promising way to improve the network throughput, especially under the infrastructure mobility scenarios which provides more indicators for node dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a series of representative physical layer techniques and analyze how they are exploited for interference management to improve the network performance.

Millions of these are surface plastic land mines with low-pressure detonation regimes, such as the mass-produced Soviet PFM-1. These aerially deployed land mines are concentrated primarily in postconflict developing countries such as Afghanistan and represent a continued humanitarian threat, while also thwarting economic and social development in impacted regions. Identification of this particular type of MEC category poses a significant geophysical challenge, as these mines contain almost no metal (nonferrous aluminum). As a result, standard MEC detection and remediation methodologies based on geophysical principles of magnetometry and electromagnetic induction prove largely ineffective and possibly dangerous. Low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles can rapidly collect large remotely sensed data sets with no risk to MEC technicians. We present results of an experiment focused on remotely assessing thermal signatures of plastic land mines relative to background geology to show that this type of analysis permits rapid detection of randomly dispersed plastic MECs with a high degree of accuracy and low associated costs. © 2018 by The Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","Article","Final","Scopus"

As, CO2 accounts for about 90% of emissions in volume, various separation technologies, such as absorption, adsorption, and membrane etc. have been studied for CO2 removal. In particular, the membrane for CO2 capture is regarded as a promising solution, due to clear advantages i.e. small foot print, easy installation, fast membrane development and flexibility in hybrid process. Furthermore, coal-fired plant contributes almost 46 % of global CO2 emission (IEA, 2016), and its dominance is expected to be remained for the near future. Hence, the introduction of CO2 capture systems to the coal-fired power plant has been considered to achieve cost-effectiveness of CO2 capture process. Here, we first developed in-house mathematical model for single-stage membrane in MATLAB® of which accuracy has been validated with literature. It is accepted that only single membrane process is limited to achieve both high purity and recovery for CO2 product simultaneously from low CO2 concentration of the feed flue gas. The multi-stage membrane is widely adopted in separation fields. The modeling framework for membrane is expanded to consider multi-stage networks, and a superstructure approach is applied for the process-synthesis of membrane systems which can evaluate all the possible configurations with various combinations of the pressure controllers, in a systematic manner. Furthermore, the optimization framework is developed, such that rigorous economic trade-off is systematically evaluated with capital expenditure (compressor, membrane etc.) and main operating expenditure of factors (power usage). Genetic Algorithm (GA) is adopted as an optimization solver to identify optimal operating conditions and membrane configurations. With the developed automated tool for membrane system, design complexity in multi-stage configurations can be readily dealt with, while system-wide design interactions can be fully exploited in confidence. Sensitivity analysis of key design variables was carried out, with which conceptual understanding and design guidelines for membrane-based CO2 capture systems are obtained. In particular, techno-economic impacts on the systems are investigated when membrane performance (permeance and selectivity) are varied. This provides practical guidelines for future membrane development in the CO2 capture process. Case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of superstructure-based optimization method and illustrate the effectiveness in identifying the most appropriate membrane network, subject to process constraints and other practical limitations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

However, birds can easily perform these maneuvers in nature. Birds have passively-deployed feathers called covert feathers on the upper and lower surfaces of their wings. These feathers protrude into the flow to mitigate flow separation during high-angle-of-attack flight. This paper presents the design optimization of a single covert-inspired flap that is attached to the upper surface of an NACA 2414 airfoil. An evolutionary algorithim, known as The CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy), is used for the design optimization. The objective function is to maximize lift and the design parameter is the flap deflection angle. The lift coefficient is calculated using an unsteady discrete vortex method (DVM). Preliminary results show that the optimal flap design improves lift up to 23% comparing with the clean airfoil at high angles of attack. This work is an important step towards achieving a spatially distributed deployable structures system, similar to the covert feathers, for separation control and stall mitigation in small unmanned air vehicles. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The objective of this paper is to suggest an evaluation tool that contains an algorithm and procedure for the reliability of manned and unmanned ground vehicles. A decision-making system is proposing for the theoretical survivability and is calculated from a threat level in the form of severity. A generic framework algorithm, consists of both linear and non-linear vehicle dynamics systems, and is included in this paper, which consists of the Fuzzy approach and various scenarios, based on straight path projection. Further, to increase the level of rigor, a layered fuzzy control system using various vehicle dynamics parameters [1] and a methodology for designing an adaptive hierarchical fuzzy model [2] and to accommodate various system parameters dependencies, are describing in this paper as a part of the survivability model. It is hoped that different users will tailor this evaluation tool and used extensively by various research workers working in different area.

The vast majority of these applications utilize lattice-matched InGaAs detectors in their imaging sensors, and these sensors are rapidly falling in price, leading to their widening adoption. As these sensors are used in novel applications and locations, it is important that ambient SWIR backgrounds be understood and characterized for a variety of different field conditions, primarily for the purposes of system performance modeling of SNR and range metrics. SWIR irradiance backgrounds do not consistently track visible-light illumination at all. There is currently little of this type of information in the open literature, particularly measurements of SWIR backgrounds in urban areas, natural areas, or indoors.

MATSim's inherent ability to represent individual travelers' adaptation to the changing travel opportunities demonstrates high effectiveness of the DBLs in cities where the level of congestion is high or very high and quantitatively estimates their qualitative effects.

Exploiting an event-based estimation paradigm, robots only send measurements to neighbors when the expected innovation for state estimation is high. Because agents know the event-Triggering condition for measurements to be sent, the lack of a measurement is thus also informative and fused into state estimates. The robots use a covariance intersection mechanism to occasionally synchronize their local estimates of the full network state. In addition, heuristic balancing dynamics on the robots' covariance-intersection-Triggering thresholds ensure that, in large-diameter networks, the local error covariances remains below desired bounds across the network. Simulations on both linear and nonlinear dynamics/measurement models show that the event-Triggering approach achieves nearly optimal state estimation performance in a wide range of operating conditions, even when using only a fraction of the communication cost required by conventional full data sharing. The robustness of the proposed approach to lossy communications as well as the relationship between network topology and covarianceintersection-based synchronization requirements are also examined. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To realize reliable UAV communications, a fundamental work is to investigate the propagation characteristics of the channels. In this paper, we propose path loss models for the UAV air-to-air (AA) scenario based on machine learning. A ray-tracing software is employed to generate samples for multiple routes in a typical urban environment, and different altitudes of Tx and Rx UAVs are taken into consideration. Two machine-learning algorithms, Random Forest and KNN, are exploited to build prediction models on the basis of the training data. The prediction performance of trained models is assessed on the test set according to the metrics including the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). Meanwhile, two empirical models are presented for comparison. It is shown that the machine-learning-based models are able to provide high prediction accuracy and acceptable computational efficiency in the AA scenario. Moreover, Random Forest outperforms other models and has the smallest prediction errors. Further investigation is made to evaluate the impacts of five different parameters on the path loss. It is demonstrated that the path visibility is crucial for the path loss. © 2018 Yan Zhang et al.","Article","Final","Scopus"

At present, there is no mature unmanned technology, so the cabin designer has to reduce the number of occupants and redistribute occupant functions. In order to test the feasibility of the new system, the new scheme of occupant function allocation must be evaluated at first. This study proposes a multi-index evaluation method to the new PRV occupant function allocation solution based on task load. A semi-physical engineering simulator was built and ergonomic experiments that combined subjective and objective evaluation to the new occupant function allocation scheme were performed in the simulator. The experiment task was two typical mission profiles: one is the long-range target attack; another is the close-range target attack. The task load includes subjective and objective evaluation indexes. The evaluation questionnaire was designed based on the multi-resource theory that contained 5 channels: visual, auditory, cognitive, speech and movement and the workload of each channel was given with a subjective scale. The objective indexes consist of the main task performance, the sub-task performance of detection response task (DRT) and two physiological indexes of skin electricity and heart rate variability. The experimental results showed that the change of occupant numbers has an impact on the performance of different task stage. The result of the subjective evaluation showed that the total task workload score were highly related to the workload score of each channel of visual, cognitive and movement channel.

This chapter discusses some of the technologies that are used by the DHS to achieve its mission. Homeland security technologies continue to evolve as the threats to national security change. This chapter focuses on applications that fall into the following areas: Detection: This is an area with a wide array of technologies and potential technologies. Technologies include new X-ray systems such as backscatter or millimeter-wave machines. There are also numerous chemical, biological, and radiation detectors. Identification: Biometrics-identification using a person’s unique physical characteristics-is increasingly being used in a number of security-related fields. Fingerprints, still the most common biometric identifier, are used as identity verification for foreign travelers arriving in the United States. The United Kingdom’s registered traveler program uses an iris-scan identification system to allow passengers to pass more quickly through automated barriers at certain airports. Other biometric identifiers currently 162in use include retina scans, face recognition, voice analysis, hand geometry, and palm-vein authentication. - ID Cards: Improved identification cards can provide a number of security benefits. Under the REAL ID program, the DHS requires that state-issued ID cards contain codes to verify authenticity. Some nations have begun placing radio-frequency identification tags in passports, while other ID cards verify authenticity through the use of an embedded biometric identifier. - Less Lethal Weapons: At one time, the search for nonlethal weapons was considered a search for an alternative to deadly force. Now, it is viewed as an effort to find tools or devices that subdue subjects without harm. Although these tools can be lethal if used inappropriately or in unusual circumstances, they are not considered weapons in the usual sense, nor are they seen as alternatives to deadly force. To distinguish between “less lethal” and “nonlethal,” the latter refers to a device that cannot cause death no matter how it is used. - Surveillance: Closed-circuit television has proved to be an invaluable investigative tool. The presence of surveillance cameras can also help to prevent a crime. Computer programs that help to identify suspicious behavior have been developed. These programs can detect intruders, loiterers, or people moving against the flow of pedestrian traffic (for instance, walking into the exit of a secure area). Unmanned surveillance aircraft are being used by Customs and Border Protection to help provide aerial surveillance video. Smaller surveillance drones are being developed for use in crowded urban environments. © 2012 Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

In the medical emergency field, response times to emergency cases are a major concern and gain a high degree of attention. Many of the systems proposed in the literature are either intended to replace the existing emergency system with a fully automated one, or build on unreliable or less efficient frameworks that are based on some sort of social media application, such as redirecting emergency requests to Facebook friends. We have designed a mobile cloud service that works side by side with the existing emergency system and is aimed at reducing the time spent waiting for emergency help to arrive, as well as making the best use of medical professionals who may be located in close proximity to the medical case. The experimental results show that the amount of time needed to find a medical professional and establish communication was between 4 and 25 seconds, depending on the communication method used. This result means that no extra time is added to the total medical response time and could enhance the chance of a better outcome. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus"

As recently as a decade ago, UAV technology has been used only by US military. Today, dozens of countries manufacture and operate military-grade drones. Drone technology has been made available around the world. Anyone can purchase a drone from an online retailer. Western military operations as well as critical infrastructure protection agencies experienced multiple drone incidents in the last years, ranging from the use of weaponized drones by ISIS to drones flying over airports or drones breaching airspace of other critical infrastructure. The emergence of threats caused by unfriendly or hostile drones requires a proactive drone detection in order to decide on appropriate defence actions. In this contribution, an open architecture of a UAV detection system including decision support for counter-Action is presented. The system is composed of multiple deployable sensor stations, an operation center comprising the operational picture display and the decision support component, and a communication bus consisting of a message-oriented middleware connecting the sub-systems and components. The architectural design specifies the sub-systems, their constitutive components, the information and control flow between the components, the protocols used for data and information exchange, the functionality and responsibility of each component, and the functional parameters. The designed architecture provides a blueprint for a UAV detection and defence actions decision-making system which will allow public protection agencies and military to react timely against threats caused by hostile drones. © 2018 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To satisfy the stringent level of criticality, each UAV in the fleet must trust the other UAVs with which it communicates to get assurance of the trustworthiness in information received and to be sure not to disclose information to an unauthorized party. In addition, to be protected against an attacker willing to eavesdrop and/or modify the exchanged data, the communication channel needs to be secured, i.e. it has to provide confidentiality and integrity of exchanges. The work presented here is based on our previous research which concluded that it is required that each UAV includes a Secure Element (which we called ARFSSD standing for Active Radio Frequency Smart Secure Device) to withstand an adversary with a high attack potential. In this paper, we propose a secure and trusted channel protocol that satisfies the stated security and operational requirements for a UAV-to-UAV communication protocol. This protocol supports three main objectives: (1) it provides the assurance that all communicating entities can trust each other and can trust their internal (secure) software and hardware states; (2) it establishes a fair key exchange process between all communicating entities so as to provide a secure channel; (3) it is efficient for both the initial start-up of the network and when resuming a session after a cold and/or warm restart of a UAV.

Although the physics, motion mechanisms and guidance have been extensively investigated, active colloids are rarely exploited to simultaneously guide and transport micron-sized objects in a controllable and reversible manner. Here, we use autonomous active Janus particles as colloidal shuttles to controllably transport cargo at the microscale using external electric and magnetic fields. The active motion arises from the metallodielectric characteristics of the Janus particles, which allows them to also trap, transport and release cargo particles through dielectrophoretic interactions induced by an AC electric field. The ferromagnetic nature of the nickel layer that forms the metallic hemisphere of the Janus colloids provides an additional mechanism to direct the motion of the shuttle using an external magnetic field. With this highly programmable colloidal system, we are able to harness active colloid motion and use it to transport cargo particles to specific destinations through a pre-defined route. A simple analytical model is derived to successfully describe the motion of the shuttle-cargo assembly in response to the applied electrical field. The high level of control on cargo pick-up, transport and release leads to a powerful delivery tool, which could eventually be used in microactuators, microfluidics or for controlled delivery within organ-on-a-chip devices. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Using a drone can be an effective way to detect potential threats in many real-life scenarios. Nevertheless, acoustic signals recorded from a drone usually exhibit a very low SNR, mainly due to the distance to the source and the proximity of the sensors to the propellers. This is a serious limiting factor and, therefore, the use of signal enhancement techniques is required. This work addresses the problem of determining the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) of the muzzle blast, captured using a planar microphone array mounted on a commercial DJI PHANTOM 4 drone in flight. This new shooter localization method that relies solely on detecting and estimating the DoA of the muzzle blast. However, the typical low SNR in this scenario requires the use of preprocessing techniques, such as signal clipping and median filtering, to enhance the signal of interest (muzzle blast). In addition, we employ a recently introduced improved data selection DoA estimation method suitable for gunshot signals recorded from a low to medium altitude mobile aerial platform. Positive results achieved indicate that this approach is effective and of practical interest. © 2018 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Parawings are conically shaped geometries that possess significant washout and camber variation across the span. A series of models with a planar leading-edge sweep of 55 deg increasing to 65 deg to form the parawing canopy were tested. Asymmetric wing tests were also conducted to explore the ability of the configurations to generate moments suitable for roll control. The results indicate a significant reduction in lift with increasing wing slackness stemming from both a reduction in the lift curve slope and positive shift in the zero-lift angle of attack. The angle of attack for zero lift is shown to correlate strongly with the peak lobe height. Asymmetric wing setting showed the generation of rolling moments comparable in magnitude with those produced by traditional ailerons. Numerical simulation indicated that a freely available lifting-surface theory application is able to accurately simulate the performance of the parawing geometry. © 2018 by the authors.

Most existing approaches for crafting adversarial examples necessitate some knowledge (architecture, parameters, etc) of the network at hand. In this paper, we focus on image classifiers and propose a feature-guided black-box approach to test the safety of deep neural networks that requires no such knowledge. Our algorithm employs object detection techniques such as SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) to extract features from an image. These features are converted into a mutable saliency distribution, where high probability is assigned to pixels that affect the composition of the image with respect to the human visual system. We formulate the crafting of adversarial examples as a two-player turn-based stochastic game, where the first player’s objective is to minimise the distance to an adversarial example by manipulating the features, and the second player can be cooperative, adversarial, or random. We show that, theoretically, the two-player game can converge to the optimal strategy, and that the optimal strategy represents a globally minimal adversarial image. For Lipschitz networks, we also identify conditions that provide safety guarantees that no adversarial examples exist. Using Monte Carlo tree search we gradually explore the game state space to search for adversarial examples. Our experiments show that, despite the black-box setting, manipulations guided by a perception-based saliency distribution are competitive with state-of-the-art methods that rely on white-box saliency matrices or sophisticated optimization procedures. Finally, we show how our method can be used to evaluate robustness of neural networks in safety-critical applications such as traffic sign recognition in self-driving cars. © The Author(s) 2018.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The test cases are unmanned air vehicles that share the same planform but differ in their span-wise profile shapes. The planform was developed under the NATO AVT-251 Task Group, referred to as the MULDICON (or MULti-DIsciplinary CONfiguration). Aerodynamic loads models are only developed for normal force and pitch moment coefficients, however, the developed approach can easily be extended to include lateral aerodynamic coefficients as well. Quasi-steady models of this work are power series expansions of traditional linear aerodynamic models to capture nonlinear effects. Additionally, the models can estimate static and dynamic stability derivatives and the control powers. Models attempt to capture global aerodynamics, as they cover changes in angle of attack (α) from −5° to 15°, a Mach range from 0.2 to 0.8, and inboard and outboard control surface deflections between ±20°, while also independently modeling α and q. Schroeder signals are used for the training maneuvers, which excite the parameters orthogonally and simultaneously. The accuracy of the developed models are compared to static data generated by CFD at test points across the flight-envelope, as well as against dynamic off-design maneuvers performed in CFD. All simulations are completed using the Kestrel CFD software.

A human-reaction time is incorporated into the probabilistic threat assessment algorithm for the human-centered risk assessment. The V2V communication have been fused with a radar sensor to achieve more enhanced tracking performance of automated vehicle. Information fusion of two tracks, V2V communication and radar sensor, is performed using Global Nearest Neighborhood (GNN) approach. A prediction of vehicle's motion follows the basic idea of the particle filtering. Based on the predicted behavior of vehicles, a collision risk is computed numerically and 321 driver data based human reaction time are incorporated to determine an active safety control intervention moment. The humancentered risk assessment algorithm has been applied to a collision avoidance scenario to monitor threat vehicles ahead and to find the best intervention point. Effects of the vehicular communication on a target vehicle state estimation and a vehicle safety control performance are investigated. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been investigated via computer simulation studies. It has been shown from both simulations and vehicle tests that the proposed human-centered risk assessment algorithm with the V2V communication can be beneficial to active safety systems in decision of controller intervention moment and in control of automated drive for the guaranteed safety. © 2018 Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"A graph-theoretic understanding of network-wide implications of local cyber protections for mission assurance","2018","Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","10.1117/12.2305957","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049352433&doi=10.1117%2f12.2305957&partnerID=40&md5=3b7a87439a0aa08b73f5a73701f0985f","Modern Department of Defense mission systems are very complex and therefore arduous to defend, especially in the cyber domain. A major cause for this concern arises from the fact that implementation of security protections occur at a local scale, while the important operational security issues stem from a global perspective of the system, e.g., mission assurance. Being able to understand network-wide implications of local cyber protections has the potential to significantly impact the strategies we use to protect modern mission systems. In this work, we present a graph-theoretic perspective on this problem, which is based on a framework for modeling and assessing the integrated cyber-physical dynamics of complex systems. Under the framework, these dynamics (and their relationships) are modeled as a graph and then analyzed using processing techniques from graphtheory. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by conducting insider-attack threat analysis and show how the application of security protections at a local scale impact network-wide security properties from an insider perspective. As a test case, we study the problem of search and rescue (SAR) using unmanned aerial vehicle teams. Unmanned vehicle teams engaged in SAR are prototypical cyber-physical systems, in which local intrusions may cause global disruptions. Here, we describe how the insider modeling framework for cyber-physical dynamics applies to this problem and present results of a network-wide assessment of security properties of the system. We use this assessment to design a security protection for the system in which we use cryptographically secure computation techniques to limit the amount of information sharing required between system components without degrading the correct operation of the system. We show how the application of these techniques on a local scale impacts the security properties of the system on a global scale. © 2018 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To serve these applications, GNSS must provide high integrity, even in the face of deliberate attacks such as spoofing. The Stanford dual polarization antenna (DPA) is a technology that uses a single patch antenna but with two feeds to examine both left and right hand circularly polarized (LHCP and RHCP, respectively) signals. Proper design and installation allows the DPA to use polarization of the incoming signal to determine direction of arrival (DOA) and elevation. These measures can be used to discriminate a genuine from a bogus broadcast. The technology can also null out some interference signals. This paper examines the continued development and field tests of our DPA. Test with genuine on-air signals have shown the ability to determine DOA and elevation. Field test in on-air spoofing and jamming conditions were also conducted. These scenarios allow us to demonstrate the performance of the DPA processing, DOA and elevation estimates. © 2018, The Institute of Navigation, Inc.

Of particular concern is the use of ML algorithms in cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as self-driving cars and aviation, where an adversary can cause serious consequences. However, existing approaches to generating adversarial examples and devising robust ML algorithms mostly ignore the semantics and context of the overall system containing the ML component. For example, in an autonomous vehicle using deep learning for perception, not every adversarial example for the neural network might lead to a harmful consequence. Moreover, one may want to prioritize the search for adversarial examples towards those that significantly modify the desired semantics of the overall system. Along the same lines, existing algorithms for constructing robust ML algorithms ignore the specification of the overall system. In this paper, we argue that the semantics and specification of the overall system has a crucial role to play in this line of research. We present preliminary research results that support this claim. © The Author(s) 2018.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Among the areas that are considered as confined space are utility tunnel, boiler, storage tank, sewage lines, utility holes and underground electrical fault. This study is concerned with hospital's enclosed space areas which include mechanical room and medicine storage area. Currently, there is no specific technique to replace worker for a task such as navigation and collecting air sample in the confined space for monitoring the hazards. A mobile robot integrated with CCD camera can be used to manoeuvre through the environment and at the same time monitor the situation in confined space.

Experimental evaluations of the physiological status of maize crops witha land area of about 4 ha on a farm located near the city of Lucera (Foggia province, Southern Italy) were carried out using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with sensors able to acquire thermal, multispectral and RGB images. The UAV was programmed to follow a path specified by several waypoints and the images were acquired from a constant altitude of 70 m with a 70 % overlap at a speed of 10 m·s-1. PixelWrench2 software was used to reconstruct the acquired images and to assess the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The analysis of the reflectance and emissivity did not highlight anomalies linked to likely incipient diseases, parasitic attacks or stress from nutritional deficiencies. The study of the images, however, pointed out a non-homogenous development of the plants in some zones most probably produced by a malfunction of the irrigation system. The thermal analysis confirmed this hypothesis. Further investigations carried out using UAV flights would be very useful to obtain a more detailed analysis of the state of the vegetation with a study of the temporal variability. © 2018 Latvia University of Agriculture.

Nevertheless, at the same time, it is also leading to a significant increase in the demand for long-Term care (LTC), especially for seniors. One viable way to offer qualified cares at home, while at the same time containing costs, is to exploit digital technologies as enablers of a constant interaction between seniors and assisting personnel. In particular, (video) games have already been identified as a viable way to foster motivation and engagement in the long term. While technical solutions to provide at home LTC has already been proposed, the scientific community is still working on general methodologies to streamline the process on the caretaker's side. In this paper, we focus on a software application to design and propose physiatric exercises from a remote location. These exercises can be extremely tailored on the requirements of each patient and can be monitored in an automated way exploiting off-The-shelf gaming technologies such as Microsoft Kinect.

We describe the development of a small frequency-modulated continuous-wave phased-array radar system that provides a three-dimensional surveillance volume. The radar measurements are processed using the recursive random sample consensus algorithm, producing tracks for the intruders and the ownship. We propose a collision-detection algorithm based on the geometric relationship between encountering aircraft. If a collision threat is detected, a collision-free new path is generated for the ownship using a two-step path-planning algorithm. In the first step, an initial suboptimal path is generated using an A search. In the second step, the path is refined using a variant of the potential fields technique, adapted to the sense-and-avoid scenario.

When studying nature, it is found that albatrosses have the highest flight performance which allow these birds to fly thousands of miles, even though they are the largest migrating bird. To study the effects of the wing shape on the aerodynamic performance of fixed wing drones, at first the wing of an albatross is patterned and compared to other inspired wing shapes as well as standard geometrical wing shapes, such as rectangular, elliptical, and delta wing shapes. Considering similar wingspan, wing area, and aspect ratio, an aerodynamic analysis is performed in the same conditions (airfoil and flight speed). The 3D-Panel and Horseshoe Vortex Lattice Methods are applied for all the wings. The results show that for lower angles of attack, the albatross wing shape generated better flight performance (lift to drag ratio) than other geometric shapes. Also, in another study, an analysis is carried-out to compare the albatross wing shape with other migrating birds, such as the artic tern, the sooty shearwater, the golden eagle, the great white pelican, and the whooper swan. It is found that albatrosses that have the ability to fly these long distances through soaring flight because of their higher lift to drag ratio, when compared to other migrating birds.

Open source intelligence (OSINT) is intelligence collected from publicly available sources, including the internet, newspapers, radio, television, government reports and professional and academic literature. Social media intelligence (SOCMINT) can be defined as the analytical exploitation of information available on social media networks. It identifies social media content as an opportunity and challenge for open source investigations. This paper provides qualitative analysis of ethics in maritime surveillance. Ethical issues concerning OSINT, SOCMINT and big data are diverse and evolving. Their impact on MARISA concerns both technology, user processes and the business/governance model. Even though international regulatory guidelines are available, specific allowances, prohibitions and exceptions mainly stem from national legislation. European Data Protection Reform (EDPR) partly harmonizes the data protection regulation in EU countries (DPA), but still leaves the possibility for variation at the national level (DPD). One big challenge is coping with the mosaic effect. Data protection sets strong requirements for MARISA technology, utilizing various data sources and performing data fusions on various levels. Another big challenge concerns the reliance on automated analysis: How can data fusion algorithms which are reliable and transparent for the end user be developed? Combined with OSINT, big data is able to map behaviour and tendencies. However, data science is needed in OSINT because of the lack/low quality of big data, to find the correct answers, capture the correct data and to have the correct perception of how to proceed throughout the process. In the context of big data, it is also notable that current academic and public debates entertain the notion of shifting the emphasis from data collection to data analytics and data use. There are scholars who underline the need for “algorithmic accountability”. It can therefore be expected that the legal requirements concerning personal data processing and big data may develop in this direction.

This chapter presents the development, production and in-service support cost of fixed-wing combat aircraft. It explains that intergenerational cost growth in combat aircraft is a long-standing issue that its original analyst, Norman Augustine, argues is still in progress. Many critics focus on increased development costs, rising production prices, and unanticipated increases. However, according to the author it is the in-service support costs that have risen to the point where they pose problems for many countries. Even when the purchase itself might be affordable, nations may lack the money to use and look after the aircraft. As a consequence, interest has increased in the use of less complex aircraft for missions where adversaries lack sophisticated air defence capabilities, and many countries and non-state movements are advancing their exploitation of unmanned air systems. Over time, however, the costs of the latter are likely to rise like the costs of aircraft, as governments will require them to have more range, agility, and autonomy, as well as better protection against anti-drone systems. In essence, therefore, cost increases in defence present a challenge that may be managed, but not solved. © 2018 selection and editorial material, John Andreas Olsen; individual chapters, the contributors.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"
"SPOT poachers in action: Augmenting conservation drones with automatic detection in near real time","2018","Proceedings of the 30th Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference, IAAI 2018","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050492703&partnerID=40&md5=d9352227e7af41c52c3944990348780f","The unrelenting threat of poaching has led to increased development of new technologies to combat it. One such example is the use of long wave thermal infrared cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) to spot poachers at night and report them to park rangers before they are able to harm animals. However, monitoring the live video stream from these conservation UAVs all night is an arduous task. Therefore, we build SPOT (Systematic POacher deTector), a novel application that augments conservation drones with the ability to automatically detect poachers and animals in near real time. SPOT illustrates the feasibility of building upon state-of-the-art AI techniques, such as Faster RCNN, to address the challenges of automatically detecting animals and poachers in infrared images. This paper reports (i) the design and architecture of SPOT, (ii) a series of efforts towards more robust and faster processing to make SPOT usable in the field and provide detections in near real time, and (iii) evaluation of SPOT based on both historical videos and a real-world test run by the end users in the field. The promising results from the test in the field have led to a plan for larger-scale deployment in a national park in Botswana. While SPOT is developed for conservation drones, its design and novel techniques have wider application for automated detection from UAV videos. © 2018 Proceedings of the 30th Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference, IAAI 2018.

This worrisome situation leads the development of new methods for carbapenemase screening, detection, prevention of spread and epidemiological data collection as mandatory. In this study, it was aimed to investigate existence and distribution of carbapenemaseencoding genes (CEGs) among carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from various clinical samples in Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ibni Sina Hospital, Central Microbiology Laboratory between June 2010-May 2014 and detect their clonal relationship. A total of 112 non-repetitive Enterobacteriaceae isolates which were intermediate or resistant to ertapenem were identified by using Phoenix (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, USA) automated microbiology system. After DNA extraction from the isolates, 11 carbapenemase-encoding genes (CEGs) (blaIMP, biaVIM, blaSPM, blaKPC, blaNDM, blaOXA-48, blaGIM, blaSIM, blaAIM, blaDIM ve blaBIC) were detected with PCR. The clonal relationship among the isolates was determined by PFGE method following digestion with Xbal DNA macrorestriction endonuclease. Among 112 isolates Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent (n= 79, 70.5%) bacteria followed by Escherichia coli (n= 15, 13.4%), Enterobacter cloacae (n= 10, 8.9%), Enterobacter aerogenes (n= 4, 3.6%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (n= 4, 3.6%) respectively. blaOXA-48 was the most frequent gene detected. Among 83 (74.1 %) isolates blaOXA-48 was detected alone and in 7 (6.3%) of the isolates it was identified with blaVIM gene coexistence. blaVIM gene was identified as the second most frequent CEG among the isolates. blaVIM gene was detected positive in 9 (8%) isolates. blaNDM gene was identified in 2 (1.8%) isolates. Ten of the K.pneumoniae isolates with identical PFGE pattern were named as pulsotype B. These isolates were found to be similar in terms of isolate location, isolation dates, antibiotic resistance patterns and the carbapenemase genes they carry, and are considered to be potential outbreak isolates originated from intensive care units. On the other hand CEGs were found in the clinical samples obtained from five out-patients suggesting that community-acquired infections may also arise due to carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae in our country where blaOXA-48 producers are endemic. According to this study, blaOXZ-48 producing gram negative bacteria were frequent in our hospital. The prevalance of blaVIM gene among metallo-beta-lactamases and coexistence with blaOXA-48 gene was remarkable. The frequency of blaNDM producing isolates in our hospital was not detected as high yet. In this study, the identification of carbapenemase producing bacteria as outbreak strains in our hospital indicated that cross-sectional surveillance for carbapenemase-producing bacteria from each patient was valuable in terms of early diagnosis of outbreaks. © 2018 Ankara Microbiology Society.

The likelihood that swarms of UAxS will be employed in high populated mega-city environments in the long and mid-term exacerbates these future challenges. The problem is two-fold: UAxS are likely to be used as additional capability for friendly forces, but they are also to be considered as possible threat. The challenges that an autonomous system poses depend not only on their physical vulnerability or the security of the networks and data, but also on the interaction with traditional troops and operating procedures to be followed, their levels of autonomy and Command and Control (C2) chain behind their employment. An extensive experimentation is necessary to address some of these challenges in a Concept Development and Experimentation (CD&E) process aimed to envision solutions. Modelling and Simulation (M&S) tools and architecture are essential to speed up this process in a cost effective way. This paper presents how the development of a particular air operational scenario in an urban environment, according to the Simulation Interoperability Standard Organization (SISO) guide using M&S tools, can support the capability development process for future UAxS as well as their countermeasures. In particular, the M&S architecture was made of a federation of simulators interacting with real C2 systems. Several technologies were exploited, such as High Level Architecture (HLA), for simulation Run-Time Infrastructure; Artificial Intelligence (AI) ad-hoc developed modules, for robotic behavior; C2 – Simulation Interoperability (C2SIMI) language, for interoperation between simulators and C2 systems.

Based on preliminary legends defined by experts, Landsat 8/OLI fusion imagery was used for object-oriented classification to obtain the vegetation map of this archipelago. This technique was later verified and validated using high-resolution images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, i.e., drones) and dedicated satellites, ground truthing, and visual confirmation around GNP coasts. This mixed methodology allowed mapping of nine native ecosystems, six invasive-dominated vegetation units, and two types of lavas. Around 53.63% of GNP is covered by native ecosystems and ∼2.2% is “canopy” dominated by invasive species to date. Native-dominated deciduous forest types cover ∼40.8% of the GNP and only ∼12.8% of the protected area is nowadays covered by humid and transitional type native ecosystems. Among humid native ecosystems, those distributed in the highlands only cover 4.8% and are highly threatened by invasive species, which are mostly distributed in these summit areas. Of the five islands (out of 18) recording invasive-dominated units, Isabela and Santa Cruz were the most infested. Cedrela odorata, Pennisetum purpureum, and Psidium guajava were the main invasive plants dominating the GNP canopy. Highly noxious Rubus niveus was the only invasive species dominating areas among the five infested islands. Methodology detailed here proved useful to provide accurate spatially-explicit islands vegetation data, potential for replication in time, and is expected to aid suitable management of highly endangered and unique biotas in this and other tropical island biomes. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This is typically obtained by imposing a large positive Static Margin (SM). The main drawbacks of this approach are the resulting understeering behaviour of the vehicle and, often, a decrease in peak lateral grip due to oversized rear tire characteristics. On the other hand, a lower SM can cause a greater time delay in the vehicle's response which hardens the control of a vehicle at limit handling for a human being. By introducing advanced autonomous driving features into future vehicles, the human factor can be excluded in limit handling manoeuvers (e.g. obstacle avoidance occurrences) and, consequently, the need for a high SM (i.e. high controllability for human drivers) can be avoided. Therefore, it could be possible to exploit the passive vehicle dynamics and enhance the performance, both in terms of peak grip and transient response. The goal of this paper is to explore if a decrease in SM can lead to a performance advantage on an obstacle avoidance manoeuver when the vehicle is driven by a robotic controller. This is achieved by analyzing the behavior of various vehicle models with different SMs and peak lateral acceleration on a non-standard double lane change manoeuver. After having characterized the dynamic response of the various models in both steady-state and unsteady-state, several tests are run on a Driver-in-Motion (DiM) dynamic driving simulator driven by human drivers. The same tests are run again in a Model-in-the-Loop (MiL) simulation where the vehicle is controlled by means of a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The results show that the robotic controller outperforms a human driver and poses interesting design challenges for autonomous vehicles. © 2018 SAE International.

A multidisciplinary approach is necessary for merging properly with integrated structural actuation systems, starting from the early design development, then increasing the overall configuration complexity from the preliminary stages. There is a multiplicity of alternatives to the benchmark configuration. Structural morphing rose to prominence recently due to increasing demand for satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle performance, spurring many studies on the topic.Design implications aside, morphing wings give rise to a number of new manufacture, assembly, and verification challenges for structural systems. The number of components drastically increases as traditional frozen architectures are supplanted by kinematic chains or compliant systems. The increased number of parts comprising the mechanical system results in an increased number of difficulties, as well as an attendant increase in the required manufacturing effort and design attention devoted to tolerances and assembly. As a result, manufacture and design scientists are expected to cooperate even more than normal due to the massive growth in schematic complexity. Furthermore, because the structure is movable, special assembly rigs must be designed to preserve the kinematic possibilities and avoid local and permanent deformations. Specialized tools must be created to execute certain specific operations on these newly-complicated components.In this chapter, significant examples of the manufacture process of morphing wing components are illustrated. Specifically, attention is focused on technological projects such as the one in which Aernnova used their own background to develop innovations in the development of adaptive modules. Under the European Union's Seventh Programme project SARISTU, this approach permitted the creation of a full-scale wing section for operative wind tunnel tests. In 3AS and CURVED projects, Aernnova focused on developing structured materials with innovative characteristics suitable for integration in morphing constituents. These experiences have been exploited in the assessment of a breakthrough adaptive rudder. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

In this context, the development of efficient methods, based on low-cost sensors, to extract precise georeferenced information from digital cameras is of utmost interest. We present a method to improve the performance of the integration of GNSS/low-cost IMU by exploiting the orientation changes retrieved from digital images. In this work, a robust-adaptive Kalman filter is also introduced to further improve the performance of the method deployed. The adaptive factor and the robust factor accomplished are determined by innovation information and the threshold value of orientation changes between consecutive images. Results from airborne tests used to assess the performance of the method are presented. The results show that using a non-metric camera, the Euler angle estimation accuracy of the GNSS/low-cost IMU integration can be improved to be close to 0.5 degree and an additional improvement, which can reach 59%, can be achieved after using the robust-adaptive Kalman filter. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Article","Final","Scopus"

They are also in global decline and under threat from a variety of anthropogenic factors. There is now an urgency to establish robust monitoring methodologies so that changes in seagrass abundance and distribution in these sensitive coastal environments can be understood. Typical monitoring approaches have included remote sensing from satellites and airborne platforms, ground based ecological surveys and snorkel/scuba surveys. These techniques can suffer from temporal and spatial inconsistency, or are very localised making it hard to assess seagrass meadows in a structured manner. Here we present a novel technique using a lightweight (sub 7 kg) drone and consumer grade cameras to produce very high spatial resolution (∼4 mm pixel−1) mosaics of two intertidal sites in Wales, UK. We present a full data collection methodology followed by a selection of classification techniques to produce coverage estimates at each site. We trialled three classification approaches of varying complexity to investigate and illustrate the differing performance and capabilities of each. Our results show that unsupervised classifications perform better than object-based methods in classifying seagrass cover. We also found that the more sparsely vegetated of the two meadows studied was more accurately classified - it had lower root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between observed and classified coverage (9–9.5%) compared to a more densely vegetated meadow (RMSD 16–22%). Furthermore, we examine the potential to detect other biotic features, finding that lugworm mounds can be detected visually at coarser resolutions such as 43 mm pixel−1, whereas smaller features such as cockle shells within seagrass require finer grained data (<17 mm pixel−1). © 2017 The Authors","Article","Final","Scopus"

A growing number of industries and scientific institutions are focusing on these devices. UAVs can be used for a really wide spectrum of civilian and military applications. Usually these devices run on batteries, thus it is fundamental to efficiently exploit their hardware to reduce their energy footprint. A key aspect in facing the “energy issue” is the exploitation of properly designed solutions in order to target the energy- and hardware-constraints characterising these devices. However, there are not universal approaches easing the implementation of ad-hoc solutions for UAVs; it just depends on the class of problems to be faced. As matter of fact, targeting machine-learning solutions to UAVs could foster the development of a wide range of interesting application.

The information on the variations in time of generation and demand is taken into account to establish a reference network configuration that considers the definition of an intraday reconfiguration strategy based on conventional load profiles for different categories of demand (residential, industrial, and commercial). After a fault, the service restoration process is aided by the formation of autonomous islanded subsystems (microgrids). During the restoration period, each subsystem is able to serve the local demand in a given portion of the network and to reconnect to the main network through proper synchronization. Dedicated solutions for mobile generation and storage are exploited to reach the nodes needing additional supply. A sequential Monte Carlo method is used to carry out reliability assessment.

"Paddy planting acreage estimation in city level based on UAV images and object-oriented classification method","2018","Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering","10.11975/j.issn.1002-6819.2018.01.010","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045064543&doi=10.11975%2fj.issn.1002-6819.2018.01.010&partnerID=40&md5=e647ef20b8f10fecb936c289d7a6429d","Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a highly efficient technology to detect land surface, which is capable of acquiring centimeter-level spatial resolution data and acquiring ground survey samples information timely and accurately. This is the basis for large-scale crop acreage estimation. However, the usual procedure of UAV image for sampling plot identification is still hand-generated, which leads to time-consuming and high cost expense. Therefore, it is urgent to develop an efficient approach to extract crop acreage in sampling plot from UAV orthographic image to support the regional crop acreage estimation. In this paper, we introduced an object-oriented automatic classification method, instead of the visually digitized method, to identify UAV quadrat paddy, and the combination of the quadrat paddy data and the paddy classification result from satellite remote sensing was exploited to estimate the paddy planting acreage. The comprehensive comparison between the methods of manual visual interpretation and object-oriented classification was carried out. This experiment was conducted in Pinghu City, Zhejiang Province. The integrated satellite imageries of Chinese GF-1 WFV sensor and American Landsat8 OLI were acquired. According to paddy phenology calendar of the study area, there were 2 key phases for the paddy identification. In middle June, paddy was in the seedling growing season, which represented the water spectrum. However, in later July, the paddy rice field showed the vegetation spectral information in satellite imagery, which was at tillering stage. The information sources of GF-1 WFV and Landsat8 OLI acquired at the respective phenological stages were sufficient to map paddy rice distribution. First, the data were preprocessed for geometric correction, and atmospheric correction was applied for both satellite images. Support vector machine (SVM) was used to identify the vegetation and water components from GF-1 data and Landsat8 data, respectively. Then, a logical ""and"" operation was conducted between vegetation and water to generate the paddy rice spatial distribution. UAV images were obtained from T10 Bumblebee platform, and a total of 7 sampling belts were acquired. Amount of UAV photos was firstly tiled by Pix4D mapper to generate UAV images with the resolution of 0.08 m. Then, UAV images were segmented by multi-scale algorithm in eCognition Developer, the segmentation scale was set to 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 and the spectral standard deviation of image objects and its rate were calculated at each scale to determine the optimal segmentation scale. After various tests, the choice of 200 was decided as the optimal segmentation scale to describe the field boundary clearly and correctly. Then, different features were constructed and nearest neighbor classification method was adopted to extract the paddy planting distribution in sampling belts. A framework of 300 m × 300 m square grids was built covering the extent of paddy as the primary sample unit, and then the sampling ratios were calculated using acreage index to allocate the samples in each stratum. Then, the regional paddy rice acreage was estimated by combining extracted paddy rice acreage based on the satellite remote sensing and UAV sampling belt. The results showed that the overall classification accuracy of paddy from UAV image was more than 93% for the object-oriented automatic classification method, which met the basic requirements of building the samples. Most of all, the difference of CVs (coefficient of variations) of the acreage estimation aided by automatic classification quadrat data and manual visual interpretation quadrat data was 0.0008, which stated the object-oriented automatic classification could achieve the same estimation performance as artificial visual interpretation method. That implies it is feasible to apply the object-oriented automatic classification in place of the visual digitization method to extract the quadrat data to support the regional paddy acreage estimation. This achievement can be applied and tested extensively in large-scale areas and with different crops. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Various proposals adopted trust management as an alternative solution since it is less costly than cryptography-based solution in terms of computation delay and mobility support. However, the existing solutions assume that, in general, the attackers have always a dishonest behavior that persists over time. This assumption may be misleading, as the attackers can behave intelligently to avoid being detected. Moreover, pseudonyms changing strategies to preserve vehicles' privacy are another issue to take into account. In this paper, a new solution for the detection of intelligent malicious behaviors based on the adaptive detection threshold is proposed. In addition to the detection of malicious nodes, our solution relies on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to face the negative impact of pseudonym changes on the detection process. Our solution also incites attackers to behave well since any malicious behavior will be immediately detected thanks to the adaptive detection threshold adopted.

The main goal is to find optimal routes that consider targets visited, threat exposure, and travel time. We formulate a mixed integer linear program that maximizes the total number of visited targets for multiple UAVs, while limiting both the route travel time for each UAV and the total threat exposure level for all UAVs to predetermined constant parameters. The formulation considers a set covering vehicle routing problem where the risk of threat exposure and the travel time are modeled for each edge in a vehicle routing network. To reduce threat exposure, waypoints are generated within the network so routes can avoid high-risk edges. We propose several waypoint generation methods. Using the candidate waypoints, the UAV routes are optimized with branch-and-cut-and-price (BCP) methodology. Minimum dependent set constraints and a simple path heuristic are used to improve the computational efficiency of the BCP algorithm. Computational results are presented, which show that the BCP algorithm performs best when the number of waypoints generated a priori is about half the number of targets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

The proposed processor implements the state-of-the-art semi-global matching (SGM) algorithm to deliver full high-definition (HD, 1920 × 1080) stereo-depth outputs with a maximum of 38 frames/s throughput. Algorithm-architecture co-optimization is conducted, introducing overlapping block-based processing that eliminates very large on-chip memory and off-chip DRAM. We exploit inherent data parallelism in the algorithm by processing 128 local disparity costs and aggregating the SGM costs along four paths for all 128 disparities in parallel. A dependence-resolving scan associated with 16-stage deep pipeline is introduced to hide the data dependence between neighboring pixels in the SGM algorithm. Moreover, we propose a customized ultra-high bandwidth dual-port SRAM that utilizes the unique memory access characteristic of SGM to achieve highly energy-efficient memory access at a very high on-chip memory bandwidth of 1.64 Tb/s.

Conventional computer vision techniques do not perform well in underwater conditions where the background is complex and the shape and textural features of fish are subtle. Data-driven classification models like neural networks require a huge amount of labelled data, otherwise they tend to over-fit to the training data and fail on unseen test data which is not involved in training. We present a state-of-the-art computer vision method for fine-grained fish species classification based on deep learning techniques. A cross-layer pooling algorithm using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network as a generalized feature detector is proposed, thus avoiding the need for a large amount of training data. Classification on test data is performed by a SVM on the features computed through the proposed method, resulting in classification accuracy of 94.3% for fish species from typical underwater video imagery captured off the coast of Western Australia.

Considering the increasing drone-related services, tracking the locations of drones can cause security threats such as escaping from drone surveillance, disturbing drone-related services, and capturing drones. For wirelessly monitoring the status of drones, telemetry is used, and this status information contains various data such as latitude and longitude, calibrated sensor outputs, and sensor offsets. Because most of the telemetry implementation supports neither authentication nor encryption, an attacker can obtain the status information of the drones by using an appropriate wireless communication device such as software-defined radio. While the attacker knows the locations of the drones from the status information, this information is not sufficient for tracking drones because the status information does not include any identity information that can bind the identity of the drone with its location. In this article, we propose a fingerprinting method for drones in motion for the binding of the identity of the drone with its location. Our fingerprinting method is based on the sensor outputs included in the status information, i.e., the offsets of micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscope, an essential sensor for maintaining the attitude of drones. We found that the offsets of MEMS gyroscopes are different from each other because of manufacturing mismatches, and the offsets of five drones obtained through their telemetry are distinguishable and constant during their flights. To evaluate the performance of our fingerprinting method on a larger scale, we collected the offsets from 70 stand-alone MEMS gyroscopes to generate fingerprints. Our experimental results show that, when using the offsets of three and two axes calculated from 128 samples of the raw outputs per axis as fingerprints, the F-scores of the proposed method reach 98.78% and 94.47%, respectively. The offsets collected after a month are also fingerprinted with F-scores of 96.58% and 78.45% under the same condition, respectively. The proposed fingerprinting method is effective, robust, and persistent. Additionally, unless the MEMS gyroscope is not replaced, our fingerprinting method can be used for drone tracking even when the target drones are flying. © 2018 ACM.","Article","Final","Scopus"

A change in bedside pupillary examination is central to the clinical diagnosis of TTH. Materials and Methods: To quantify the changes in the pupillary examination that precede and accompany TTH and its treatment, we evaluated 12 episodes of herniation in three patients with supratentorial mass lesions using automated pupillometry (NeurOptics, Inc., Irvine, CA). Herniation was defined clinically by the onset of fixed and dilated pupils in association with decreased levels of consciousness. Automated pupillometry was measured simultaneously with the bedside clinical examination, but the clinical team was blinded to these results and could not act on the data. Data from the pupillometer were downloaded 1-2 times per week onto a secured laptop, and data processing was facilitated by the use of Mathematica 8.0. Results: Neurologic Pupil Index measurements, values generated by the pupillometer based on an algorithm that incorporates pupillary size and reactivity in a normal population, were found to be abnormal before 73% of TTHs. This abnormality occurred at a median of 7.4 h before TTH. All episodes of TTH were reversed after clinical intervention at a median of 43 min after the event. The value did not fall to 0 in 42% of clinical herniations, but it did decrease to very abnormal values of 0.5-0.8. Conclusions: The potential of automated pupillometry to guide the management of severely injured neurologic patients is intriguing and warrants further study in the critical care unit and beyond. The utility of a portable device in the combat setting may allow for triage of patients with severe neurologic injury. © Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2018.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we will address this issue by building a secure mechanism for such systems. We will design a detection approach and a mitigation approach for better stable performance of NCS. To ensure the stability of NCS at the time of DDoS attack, we will also design a switching mechanism (SM) for cloud control system (CCS) when there are no more real time solutions available from the cloud.

Potential future applications include evacuated-tube high-speed ground transportation, high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles, Martian aircraft, and rotorcraft. For the quantification of rarefaction effects, theNACA0012 airfoilwas analyzed using continuum Navier-Stokes equations in the low Reynolds transonic regime. The results were compared to the deterministic solution of the ellipsoidal statistical Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model Boltzmann kinetic equation with the Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method. Numerical simulations using these methods were compared to the electron beamfluorescence experiments at a Reynolds number of 73 and aMach number of 0.8. It was observed that the numerical solution of ellipsoidal statistical Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model using the Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method with third-order accuracy is the most computationally efficient. It was also shown that, when the Reynolds number of the flow decreased from 10,000 to 1000, slip effects become dominant. The flow becomes fully rarefiedatRe8-10.Furthermore, rarefactioneffectswere quantifiedfor theNACA0007 andtheNACA2407 at 0 and 10 deg of angles of attack to investigate the effects of thickness, camber, and the angle of attack. Itwas observed that flow separation due to an increase in thickness resulted in higher rarefaction effects. It was concluded that thin airfoils with very smooth shape changes minimize the continuum breakdown and rarefaction effects. Copyright © 2017 by the authors.

Then, we use our approach to discuss traffic scenarios with several autonomous vehicles, whose dynamics is described through differential equations, and the avoidance of collisions couples the optimal control problems of the vehicles. For the solution to the discretized problems, we prove strong convergence of the states and weak convergence of the controls.

Security researchers put up a lot of effort to develop exploits and analyze existing exploits with the goal of staying ahead of the state-of-the-art in attacks and defenses. The urge for automated systems that operate at scale, speed and efficiency is therefore undeniable. Given their complexity and large user base, web browsers pose an attractive target. Due to various mitigation strategies, the exploitation of a browser vulnerability became a time consuming, multi-step task: creating a working exploit even from a crashing input is a resource-intensive task that can take a substantial amount of time to complete. In many cases, the input, which triggers a vulnerability follows a crashing path but does not enter an exploitable state. In this paper, we introduce novel methods to significantly improve and partially automate the development process for browser exploits. Our approach is based on the observation that an analyst typically performs certain manual analysis steps that can be automated. This serves the purpose to propagate the bug-induced, controlled data to a specific program location to carry out a desired action. These actions include achieving write-what-where or control over the instruction pointer primitives. These are useful to extend control over the target program and are necessities towards successful code execution, the ultimate goal of the adversary. We implemented a prototype of our approach called PrimGen. For a given browser vulnerability, it is capable of automatically crafting data objects that lead the execution to a desired action. We show in our evaluation that our approach is able to generate new and previously unknown exploitation opportunities for real-world vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Google Chrome. Using small templates, PrimGen generates inputs that conducts specific primitives. In total, PrimGen has found 48 JavaScript inputs which conduct the desired primitives when fed into the target browsers.  © 2018 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Each aerial manipulator that consists of a hexacopter and a two-degree-of-freedom robotic arm is controlled by an augmented adaptive sliding mode controller based on a closed-chain robot dynamics. We propose a motion planning algorithm by exploiting rapidly exploring random tree star (RRT∗) and dynamic movement primitives (DMPs). The desired path for each aerial manipulator is obtained by using RRT∗ with Bezier curve, which is designed to handle environmental obstacles, such as buildings or equipments. During aerial transportation, to avoid unknown obstacle, DMPs modify the trajectory based on the virtual leader-follower structure. By the combination of RRT∗ and DMPs, the cooperative aerial manipulators can carry a common object to keep reducing the interaction force between multiple robots while avoiding an obstacle in the unstructured environment. To validate the proposed planning and control synthesis, two experiments with multiple custom-made aerial manipulators are presented, which involve user-guided trajectory and RRT∗-planned trajectory tracking in unstructured environments.Note to Practitioners - This paper presents a viable approach to autonomous aerial transportation using multiple aerial manipulators equipped with a multidegree-of-freedom robotic arm. Existing approaches for cooperative manipulation based on force decomposition or impedance-based control often require a heavy or expensive force/torque sensor. However, this paper suggests a method without using a heavy or expensive force/torque sensor based on closed-chain dynamics in joint space and rapidly exploring random tree star (RRT∗) that generates the desired trajectory of aerial manipulators. Unlike conventional RRT∗, in this paper, our method can also avoid an unknown moving obstacle during aerial transportation by exploiting RRT∗ and dynamic movement primitives. The proposed planning and control synthesis is tested to demonstrate performance in a lab environment with two custom-made aerial manipulators and a common object. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Primary hemostasis describes the interactions of platelet receptors with endothelial cells, von Willebrand factor, and collagen, although platelet interactions with thrombin, fibrinogen, leukocytes and even red blood cells likely play a role as well. Clinically, patients with thrombocytopenia may present with signs of hemorrhage or be asymptomatic. Bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia is most commonly manifested as petechiae, ecchymoses, and mucosal bleeding such as epistaxis, melena, hematochezia, and hematuria. Diagnosis is confirmed with a manual platelet count as automated platelet counts are not reliable in thrombocytopenia. The ideal therapy of hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia is platelet transfusion but this is often unavailable in veterinary medicine.

A new fully automated electro-thermal tester that enable one to inject currents through the composites and measure the surface temperature in real time has been developed. The DC electrical conductivity and dielectric properties of electrified composites have been investigated, in order to develop a nondestructive testing method for electro-thermal damage. Additionally, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA), flexural properties, surface morphology analysis, and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were conducted to exploit in-depth the damage mechanism of electrified composites. Results show that the electrical conductivity is decreased with increasing currents, resulting from the modification of the fiber-to-fiber conduction paths. With higher currents the dielectric properties are apparently enhanced, and this case can be explained by interfacial polarization that arises from the microcracking induced by the residual thermal stress. The dielectric loss tangent can be regard as a characteristic parameter of electro-thermal damage. Furthermore, the deterioration of flexural performances is attributed to the microcracking, which is proved to be the major damage mechanism. High-intensity currents application has an effect of post-curing and physical aging, which significantly increases the glass transition temperature and suppresses the further formation of micro damage. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Article","Final","Scopus"

ACO is especially suitable for the complexity and probabilistic nature of the minimum time search (MTS) problem, where a balance between the computational requirements and the quality of solutions is needed. The presented approach includes a new MTS heuristic that exploits the probability and spatial properties of the problem, allowing our ant based algorithm to quickly obtain high-quality high-level straight-segmented UAV trajectories. The potential of the algorithm is tested for different ACO parameterizations, over several search scenarios with different characteristics such as number of UAVs, or target dynamics and location distributions. The statistical comparison against other techniques previously used for MTS (ad hoc heuristics, cross entropy optimization, bayesian optimization algorithm and genetic algorithms) shows that the new approach outperforms the others. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The system was built by laser engraving a manifold pattern on an acrylic block and sealing with another flat acrylic plate to form a microfluidic channel platform. The platform was incorporated with small solenoid valves to obtain a portable setup for programmable control of the liquid flow into the channel according to the HSI principle. The system was demonstrated for the determination of phosphate using a molybdenum blue method. An ascorbic acid, standard or sample, and acidic molybdate solutions were sequentially aspirated to fill the channel forming a stack zone before flowing to the detector. Under the optimum condition, a linear calibration graph in the range of 0.1–6 mg P L−1 was obtained. The detection limit was 0.1 mg L−1. The system is compact (5.0 mm thick, 80 mm wide × 140 mm long), durable, portable, cost-effective, and consumes little amount of chemicals (83 μL each of molybdate and ascorbic acid, 133 μL of the sample solution and 1.7 mL of water carrier/run).

Most current approaches are based on either optimization or Gaussian filter, which depends on a manually provided initial guess. In this paper, we propose a two-step fully automatic calibration algorithm, which does not require any prior knowledge of the un-calibrated parameters. In the first step, both the odometric parameters and the extrinsic ones are estimated through a non-iterative auto initialization process. In the second step, a joint optimization problem is solved iteratively to obtain a refined calibration result. By exploiting the planar motion constraints of the landmark measurements, our auto initialization method outperforms a comparison approach in robustness against the image noise. Experiments are conducted with data sets collected from both simulation and an autonomous guided vehicle system, which validates the improvement. © 2017 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Gust soaring is a flight technique of energy harvesting in such a complex and stochastic domain. The presented work shows the feasibility and benefits of exploiting a nonstationary environment for a small unmanned aerial vehicle. A longitudinal dynamics trajectory is derived, showing significant benefits in extended flight with a sinusoidal wind profile. An optimization strategy for active control is performed, with the aim of obtaining the most effective set of gains for energy retrieval. Moreover, a three-dimensional multipoint model confirms the feasibility of energy harvestingin a more complex spatial wind field. The influence of unsteady aerodynamics is determined on the overall energy gain along the flight path with active proportional control. The aerodynamic derivatives describing the contribution to lift by a change in angle of attack and elevator deflection are identified as the most contributing aerodynamic parameters for energy harvesting in a gusty environment, and are therefore suggested as a basic objective function of an unmanned aerial vehicle design for such a flight strategy.

Blackouts present a huge challenge to power distribution companies and often occur due to tree growth in hilly and rural areas. There are numerous methods of monitoring hazardous overgrowth that are expensive and time-consuming. Accurate estimation of tree and vegetation heights near power poles can prevent the disruption of power transmission in vulnerable zones. This paper presents a cost-effective approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to compute the height (depth maps) of objects proximal to power poles and transmission lines. The proposed CNN extracts and classifies features by employing convolutional pooling inputs to fully connected data layers that capture prominent features from stereo image patches. Unmanned aerial vehicle or satellite stereo image datasets can thus provide a feasible and cost-effective approach that identifies threat levels based on height and distance estimations of hazardous vegetation and other objects. Results were compared with extant disparity map estimation techniques, such as graph cut, dynamic programming, belief propagation, and area-based methods.

Methods Kirby-Bauer method or automated systems was employed to study the antimicrobial susceptibility. The data were analyzed according to CLSI 2015 breakpoints. Results A total of 5 485 bacterial strains were isolated from 48 908 specimens in Liuzhou Workers’ Hospital during 2016, of which gram negative organisms accounted for 70.3% and gram positive cocci 29.7%. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant strains was 18.3% (83/454) in S. aureus and 72.5% (232/320) in coagulase negative Staphylococcus. No staphylococcal strains were found resistant to vancomycin or linezolid. Of the 207 strains of non-meningitis S. pneumoniae, 181 (87.4%) were isolated from children and 26 (12.6%) from adults. One E. faecium strain was identified as resistant to vancomycin. The prevalence of ESBLs-producing strains was 49.0% (619/1 263) in E. coli and 31.8% (202/636) in Klebsiella spp. Enterobacteriaceae strains were still highly susceptible to carbapenem antibiotics. Overall, 0.6% (14/2 326) and 1.5% (36/2 326) of the Enterobacteriaceae strains were resistant to imipenem and meropenem, respectively. Conclusions Antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, especially carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, are posing an increasing threat to clinical practice.

The framework is capable of reliably, robustly assessing a given highway situation (with respect to the possibility of collision) and of automatically determining an appropriate maneuver for the situation. It consists of two main components: Situation assessment and strategy decision. The situation assessment component utilizes multiple complementary 'threat measures' and Bayesian networks in its calculations of 'threat levels' at the car and lane level to evaluate the possibility of collisions for a given highway traffic situation. The strategy decision component, designed to generate goal-directed and collision-free behaviors, automatically determines an appropriate maneuver in a given highway situation via a hierarchical state machine-such a machine both reduces the complexity of and extends a strategy model. The types of maneuver determined by the component include both simple maneuvers, such as slowing down to avoid collision with a vehicle in front, and complex maneuvers, such as lane changes and overtaking. The presented decision-making framework is tested and evaluated-both on a closed high-speed test track in simulated traffic with various driving scenarios and on public highways in real traffic through in-vehicle testing-to verify that it can provide sufficiently reliable performance for automated driving in highway environments in terms of safety, reliability, and robustness. © 2011 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Tobacco smoking is one of the most prevailing risk factors. Due to its addictiveness, it is often very difficult to quit. Abstinent smokers often start with a sudden craving for smoking which results in lapse and then permanent relapse. In this paper, we propose a sensor-based approach for automated recognition of smoking activity. That may be used for providing interventions in near real-time via mobile app to promote smoking cessation. A 6-axis inertial sensor along with a heart rate sensor is to be used to develop a wearable band which could be worn on the wrist. A pilot study is conducted with four participants. Their hand movement pattern is recorded for around 5 minutes for smoking and non-smoking intervals each, using a sensor based unit worn on the wrist. This period includes smoking and non-smoking intervals. Preliminary analysis of the data shows that there exists a periodicity in the data during the smoking episode. During non-smoking interval the sensor signals are random and does not exhibit such periodicity. Further data collection with more number of participants in different environments, data preprocessing, analysis, training, model generation, and testing is under progress.

They have been disconnected from each other and from the continent for hundreds of thousands to millions of years and encompass a high incidence of endemic plant species, with values that can exceed 20% of the local flora. Despite this, relatively few studies have been carried out to unravel ecological and evolutionary aspects of plant reproduction. We synthesise here the available information on the breeding systems, pollination and seed dispersal mode of the Mediterranean island flora. The main objective is to identify general patterns as well as to detect the main gaps in information on reproductive ecology in these particular and vulnerable systems in the face of global change. We also briefly review the information on impacts of invasive species on plant reproduction and dispersal, as these are some of the main threats to island biodiversity in general and Mediterranean island plant diversity in particular. The review has revealed that most available information is very geographically biased towards the western Mediterranean islands, especially the Balearic Islands, although a good fraction of studies have also been carried out on the eastern islands in the Aegean archipelago. Moreover, the majority of data come from species-focused studies, mainly endemic species of restricted range, whereas only a small fraction of studies have been performed at a community level. Relatively little work has involved genetic analyses, mainly focused on assessing the genetic differentiation and variability on narrow endemics. Contrary to our expectations, most island species do not rely on autonomous selfing, which might be related to the relatively high diversity of pollinators. The small, uninhabited, islands might be the last refuges of peculiar interactions that evolved in them in ancient times; they thus should be considered as sanctuaries of extraordinary biodiversity. Finally, we point out the main gaps of information and formulate a set of hypotheses that we believe are worth testing in future studies if we are to advance knowledge on the reproductive biology of Mediterranean island plants. © 2017 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands","Review","Final","Scopus"

We show that UGVs do not have adequate protection against GPS spoofing attacks. Consequently, they can easily be penetrated by attackers. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The stability and control configuration is considered. Its geometry as well as the low-speed aerodynamics and the corresponding flow physics are well known from the literature: For medium angles of attack, the flow around the leading edge is governed by three sections: namely, an apex vortex in the front part, a region of attached flow in the middle portion, and a tip vortex in the outer part of the leading edge. The size of these regions varies with the angle of attack. In the present study, the compressible flow around this configuration has been calculated using the computational fluid dynamics DLR TAU code in the Mach number range of 0.55 < M∞ < 0.85 and angles of attack of 0 deg < α < 16 deg for a constant Reynolds number of Re∞ = 23 × 106 corresponding to the cruise condition of the unmanned combat aerial vehicle. With an increasing Mach number, the flow in the central region of the leading edge becomes supersonic and the upstream movement of the tip vortex with an increasing angle of attack is hindered. However, at the rear end of the supersonic zone, shock-induced separation takes place, forming an additional vortex. This shock-induced vortex joins the tip vortex. Thus, the onset of the tip vortex would move upstream again, with an increasing angle of attack passing the rear end of the supersonic zone. The corresponding, very complex vortex formation is analyzed by means of the Mach number and angle-of-attack variation. The effects of these flow phenomena on the aerodynamic characteristics are demonstrated. Copyright © 2015 by German Aerospace Center (DLR).","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The rapid evolution of face recognition systems into real-time applications has raised new concerns about their ability to resist presentation attacks, particularly in unattended application scenarios such as automated border control. The goal of a presentation attack is to subvert the face recognition system by presenting a facial biometric artifact. Popular face biometric artifacts include a printed photo, the electronic display of a facial photo, replaying video using an electronic display, and 3D face masks. These have demonstrated a high security risk for state-of-the-art face recognition systems. However, several presentation attack detection (PAD) algorithms (also known as countermeasures or antispoofing methods) have been proposed that can automatically detect and mitigate such targeted attacks. The goal of this survey is to present a systematic overview of the existing work on face presentation attack detection that has been carried out. This paper describes the various aspects of face presentation attacks, including different types of face artifacts, state-of-the-art PAD algorithms and an overview of the respective research labs working in this domain, vulnerability assessments and performance evaluation metrics, the outcomes of competitions, the availability of public databases for benchmarking new PAD algorithms in a reproducible manner, and finally a summary of the relevant international standardization in this field.

The vast majority of the literature on this subject is focused on addressing path planning for area coverage under the assumption that the robot’s pose is known or that error is bounded. In this work, we remove this assumption and develop a completely probabilistic representation of coverage. We show that coverage is guaranteed as long as the robot pose estimates are consistent, a much milder assumption than zero or bounded error. After formally connecting robot sensor uncertainty with area coverage, we propose an adaptive sliding window filter pose estimator that provides a close approximation to the full maximum a posteriori estimate with a computation cost that is bounded over time. Subsequently, an adaptive planning strategy is presented that automatically exploits conditions of low vehicle uncertainty to more efficiently cover an area. We further extend this approach to the multi-robot case where robots can communicate through a (possibly faulty and low-bandwidth) channel and make relative measurements of one another. In this case, area coverage is achieved more quickly since the uncertainty over the robots’ trajectories is reduced. We apply the framework to the scenario of mapping an area of seabed with an autonomous underwater vehicle. Experimental results support the claim that our method achieves guaranteed complete coverage notwithstanding poor navigational sensors and that resulting path lengths required to cover the entire area are shortest using the proposed cooperative and adaptive approach. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this study, an effective and low-cost fingerprint identification (FI) solution is proposed that can exploit the parallel computational power of GPU proficiently. It is achieved by mapping a generalised minutia neighbour-based novel encoding and matching algorithm on low-cost GPU technology. The proposed solution achieves high accuracy in comparison with two open source matchers and it is shown to be scalable by comparing matching performance on different GPUs. The proposed GPU implementation employs multithreading and loop unrolling, which minimises the use of nested loops and avoids sequential matching of encoded minutia features. After a thorough and careful designing of data structures, memory transfers and computations, a GPU-based fingerprint matching system is developed. It achieves on average 50,196 fingerprint matches per second on a single GPU. As compared to the sequential central processing unit implementation, the proposed system achieves a speed up of around 92 times, while maintaining the accuracy. The proposed system with matcher integrated on GPU can be considered as a good, low-cost, robust and efficient solution for large-scale applications of automated FI systems. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.","Article","Final","Scopus"

These applications are effective and secure only after the successful verification of machine type communication devices (MTCDs). Hence, various group-based authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocols were proposed in the literature to achieve the authentication. These protocols fulfill all the security requirements such as privacy preservation, mutual authentication, integrity, and confidentiality. But, none of them have the credential to overcome the single key problem in the communication network. In addition, they do not have the efficacy to maintain the group key unlink-Ability and are susceptible to the identified attacks. In some of the protocols, each MTCD needs to authenticate independently to simultaneously access the communication network that generates network congestion overhead. In view of these problems, we propose the security enhanced group-based (SEGB) AKA protocol for M2M communication in an IoT-enabled LTE/LTE-A network. The SEGB-AKA protocol solves the problem of the single key during the authentication process and achieves the key forward/backward secrecy. The protocol overcomes the problem of signaling congestion and high bandwidth consumption. The formal security analysis of the protocol is carried out by the automated Internet security protocols and applications tool. The security analysis shows that the protocol achieves the security goals and is free from various known attacks. Moreover, the performance of the proposed SEGB-AKA protocol is analyzed with the existing group-based AKA protocols. The analysis shows that the protocol has better results in terms of network overheads and fulfills all the security requirements of M2M communication. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This paper evaluates the effects of the Reynolds (Re) number on the hydrodynamic characteristics of AUV for various angles of attack (AOA). To estimate the hydrodynamic parameters, a numerical modelling based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is employed. Reynolds numbers between 2×106 and 150×106 were examined at -10° to 10° AOAs. Experimental tests for the same AUV in Re = 2×106 in the water tunnel were carried out for CFD validation. A comparison of the results showed an acceptable agreement between the numerical method and the experimental results. The results show that hydrodynamic parameters can be a function of Re and converge on a constant in a limited value when the Re number increases. Results of independent parameters, can be used for full-scale without the establishment of dynamic similarity. © 2018 Isfahan University of Technology.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we propose an approach called Clustering-based Partitioned Earliest Deadline First (C-PEDF) algorithm to schedule dual-criticality implicit-deadline sporadic tasks on a homogeneous multicore system. Our C-PEDF scheduling approach exploits (i) a Clustering-based bin-packing algorithm that explicitly accounts the demands of tasks based on their levels of confidence; and (ii) an Enhanced dual-mode scheduling policy to schedule tasks within a core. The proposed C-PEDF integrates every single high-level workload with a group of low-level workloads and coalesces them into a cluster. Within each cluster, tasks are scheduled under our Enhanced dual-mode scheduling policy to improve the service level of high-level tasks without jeopardizing the schedulability of low-level tasks. Clusters are scheduled under Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling approach. We conduct a schedulability test for the proposed technique, and we demonstrate how workloads can be clustered by means of Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model.

When exploiting IBVS, the image feature velocity command obtained from the visual loop controller is converted to the velocity command of the workspace through the interaction matrix so as to converge image feature error. However, issues such as the noise/disturbance arising from image processing and the smoothness of image feature command are often overlooked in the design of the visual loop controller, especially in a contour following task. In particular, noise in the image feature will contaminate the image feedback signal so that the visual loop performance can be substantially affected. To cope with the aforementioned problem, this article employs the sliding mode controller to suppress the adverse effects caused by image feature noise. Moreover, by exploiting the idea of motion planning, a parametric curve interpolator is developed to generate smooth image feature commands. In addition, a depth observer is also designed to provide the depth information essential in the implementation of the interaction matrix. In order to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach, a two-degrees-of-freedom planar robot that employs an IBVS structure and an eye-to-hand camera configuration is used to conduct a contour following task.

As dc distribution has different nature to the conventional ac system, a new design of well-structured control and management methods will be mandatory. In this paper, a shipboard power system with dc distribution and energy storage system (ESS) is picked as the study case. To meet the requirement of control and management of such a large-scale mobile power system, a hierarchical control design is proposed in this paper. In order to fully exploit the benefit of the ESS, as well as to overcome the limitation in controllability, a novel inverse-droop control method is proposed, in which the power sharing is according to the source characteristic, instead of their power rating. A frequency-division method is also proposed as an extension to the inverse-droop method for enabling a hybrid ESS and its autonomous operation. On the basis of the proposed methods, the control methods for management and voltage restoration levels are also proposed to establish a comprehensive control solution. Real-time simulations are carried out to validate the performance of the proposed control design under different operating conditions.

"An optimized and secure BUTE - Binding update using twofold encryption for next generation IP mobility","2018","Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems","10.3233/JIFS-169427","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044766238&doi=10.3233%2fJIFS-169427&partnerID=40&md5=4dc6bf3f05e89c1d980390bffe484e2e","The mobile Internet Protocol (IP) is a mobility based communication protocol that provides guidelines for the routing of mobile nodes in a network. The mobile IP manipulates IP addresses as a natural identifier for each mobile communicant. Here, each mobile device recognizes itself via two IP addresses: a home-of address and a care-of address. Owing to the mobility nature of the these devices, the location update of their current care-of address plays a vital role in receiving continuous services without interference. Many investigations have been explored on the location update of mobile devices along with the security and computation issues. However, the efforts on the security services have not received much attention in these investigations. Consequently, there is an increasing need for optimized binding update that balances security and efficiency. In this paper, a new Binding Update using Twofold Encryption (BUTE) is proposed, for balancing both security and efficiency of binding update for IPv6 mobility. It exhibits the alleviation of the attacks such as rerun, man-in-the-middle, false binding update and denial-of-service. The proposed BUTE is simulated using network simulator-2 and the experimental results are analyzed. Also, it is validated for security attributes using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) - a security tool. Finally, the numerical results reveal that the proposed BUTE provides a significant reduction in communication cost and binding update delays. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

"A hierarchical detection method in external communication for self-driving vehicles based on TDMA","2018","PLoS ONE","10.1371/journal.pone.0188760","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040334264&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0188760&partnerID=40&md5=382f81902445477bf1f293c3475e86f4","Security is considered a major challenge for self-driving and semi self-driving vehicles. These vehicles depend heavily on communications to predict and sense their external environment used in their motion. They use a type of ad hoc network termed Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Unfortunately, VANETs are potentially exposed to many attacks on network and application level. This paper, proposes a new intrusion detection system to protect the communication system of self-driving cars; utilising a combination of hierarchical models based on clusters and log parameters. This security system is designed to detect Sybil and Wormhole attacks in highway usage scenarios. It is based on clusters, utilising Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) to overcome some of the obstacles of VANETs such as high density, high mobility and bandwidth limitations in exchanging messages. This makes the security system more efficient, accurate and capable of real time detection and quick in identification of malicious behaviour in VANETs. In this scheme, each vehicle log calculates and stores different parameter values after receiving the cooperative awareness messages from nearby vehicles. The vehicles exchange their log data and determine the difference between the parameters, which is utilised to detect Sybil attacks and Wormhole attacks. In order to realize efficient and effective intrusion detection system, we use the well-known network simulator (ns-2) to verify the performance of the security system. Simulation results indicate that the security system can achieve high detection rates and effectively detect anomalies with low rate of false alarms. Copyright: © 2018 Alheeti et al.

Their actual position is unknown, and pollution originating from corroded munitions is only roughly estimated. One of possible low-cost solution is the creation of monitoring network, providing info about exact location and environmental threat posed by sea dumped CW. MODUM project aimed at the establishment of the monitoring network observing Chemical Weapons dumpsites in the Baltic Sea, using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV’s) and remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROV’s), and utilizing existing research vessels of partner institutions as launching platforms. Project consisted of the test phase, which helped choosing best available solutions for the difficult Baltic Sea environment, Survey phase, which located actual objects of concern, and monitoring phase, which concentrated on the collection of environmental data close to the objects of concern. The result of the project is a set of methods and procedures that are applicable for the dumpsites monitoring, ranging from sea bottom survey, object identification to actual environmental parameters collection, biota exposure and portable chemical warfare agents (CWA) analysis.

This problem is highly complex, especially when multiple platforms are deployed. Besides the automated suggestions for an effective search strategy, a remote advice and assist cell can benefit from visual aid in the form of a heat map overlay on a geographical map, which evolves according to both the expected target movements and the observations made by the sensors. Such decision support software can be equipped with optimization algorithms that provide search strategies. However, the algorithms are only as good as the accuracy of the parameter configuration, such as the estimation of the target motion and the search effectiveness of the sensor. In this paper, we focus on the estimation of the latter parameter for two sensors and two types of targets. The first step in this process consists of field experiments to approximate the target dependent sensor ranges. We then describe a fictive but realistic scenario in which a suspect carrying radiological material must be detected to prevent a terrorist attack in the center of a big city. We show how to estimate the parameters for the search effectiveness in this scenario. Finally, in a proof of concept, we compare two algorithms for optimization of a search strategy for multiple searchers. Here, the algorithms are configured using the mentioned parameter estimations. Computational experiments show that the search effectiveness significantly influences the probability of detection throughout the search. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Then the chaotic searching algorithm is used to initialize the collection of paths, which is regard as foods of the ABC algorithm. With the limited data, the initial collection can search the optimal area of paths perfectly. Finally simulations of the multi-USV path planning under various threats have been carried out.

The Target UAV cooperates with up to two Defender missiles which are launched in order to intercept the Attacker before the latter reaches the Target. This is a scenario with important military applications where each one of the agents is an autonomous air vehicle. Each agent plans and corrects its course of action in order to defeat an opposing force while simultaneously optimizing an operational relevant cost/payoff performance measure. The Target and the Defenders cooperate to form a team against the Attacker. The results in this paper build on the solution of a three agent differential game, where the three players are the Target, the Attacker, and one Defender; in this paper, the benefits of firing a second Defender are considered. Indeed, launching two interceptor missiles is a standard procedure by providing redundant backup. Building on the solution of the one-Defender problem, it is possible to address a seemingly intractable problem, where the Target needs to decide which Defender(s) to cooperate with, in addition to obtaining the optimal headings of every player in the game. Given the initial positions of the players, we solve the problem of determining if a second Defender improves the Target/Defender(s) payoff and provide the optimal strategies for each of the agents involved. Finally, we address the game of kind (for the case of one Defender) which provides the safety regions to determine which side will win based on the initial state. These safety regions provides the Target’s area of vulnerability, and using these results, we describe the reduction to the Target’s vulnerability area brought by an additional Defender. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).","Article","Final","Scopus"

The optical spectral range can be used to monitor exploitation of the UAV. It is recommended to develop specialized spectral indices for such equipment.

In the created neural networks, the linear model is represented as a network without intermediate layers, which in the output layer contains only linear elements, the weight corresponds to the elements of the matrix, and the thresholds are the components of the shear vector. During the operation, the neural network actually multiplies the vector of inputs into the matrix of scales, and then adds a vector of displacement to the resulting vector. Results of the research show how to create the specialized Robot Plane Vegetation Indices adapted to technological capabilities of UAVs.

Furthermore, this is being done today on an individual level (one vehicle per operators), with some exceptions of a handful of new systems, that are comprised of a small number of self-organizing swarms, manually guided by a human operator. Drones-based monitoring is of great importance in variety of civilian domains, such as road safety, homeland security, and even environmental control. In its military aspect, efficiently detecting evading targets by a fleet of unmanned drones has an ever increasing impact on the ability of modern armies to engage in warfare. The latter is true both traditional symmetric conflicts among armies as well as asymmetric ones. Be it a speeding driver, a polluting trailer or a covert convoy, the basic challenge remains the same “how can its detection probability be maximized using as little number of drones as possible.

The patient was a 79-year-old woman who underwent nDSAEK for an extremely mydriatic BK eye with an incomplete barrier between the anterior and posterior chambers. She had undergone argon laser iridotomy for acute glaucoma at the age of 59 years and cataract surgery 3 years later. The pupil was extremely mydriatic as a result of iris sphincter muscle damage associated with an acute glaucoma attack and cataract surgery. After cataract surgery, the dislocated intraocular lens (IOL) sometimes touched the corneal endothelium. Despite simultaneous surgery to remove the dislocated IOL and lens capsule, vitrectomy, and intrascleral IOL fixation, her corneal endothelial decompensation progressed to BK. During nDSAEK, three 9-0 Prolene suture threads were placed through the recipient's cornea, limbus-to-limbus, resembling wheel spokes, to prevent the graft from dropping into the vitreous cavity. With the aid of these pre-placed sutures, the graft was inserted safely and was well attached to the host's posterior cornea by air tamponade without suturing. The wheel spokes technique prevented the endothelial graft from dropping during intraoperative manipulation, suggesting that nDSAEK is possible even in an extremely mydriatic aphakic BK eye without capsule support. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by S.

In these cases, spying with drones, transfer of dangerous payloads, or losing reliable drone control can represent a new hazard for people, governments, and business sector. The technologies to detect, track, and disarm possible aerial threats are therefore in prompt demand. To this end, ubiquitous cellular networks, and especially 5G infrastructures based on the use of millimeter-wave radio modules, may be efficiently leveraged to offer the much needed drone detection capabilities. In this work, we propose to exploit 5G millimeter-wave deployments to detect violating amateur drones. We argue that the prospective 5G infrastructure may provide all the necessary technology elements to support efficient detection of small-sized drones. We therefore outline a novel technology and system design perspective, including such considerations as the density of base stations, their directional antennas, and the available bandwidth, among others, as well as characterize their impact with our ray-based modeling methods. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To enable such innovative systems, we need faster object detection. In this work, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and speed with domain-specific approximations, i.e. category-aware image size scaling and proposals scaling, for two state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detection meta-architectures. We study the effectiveness of applying approximation both statically and dynamically to understand the potential and the applicability of them. By conducting experiments on the ImageNet VID dataset, we show that domain-specific approximation has great potential to improve the speed of the system without deteriorating the accuracy of object detectors, i.e. up to 7.5x speedup for dynamic domain-specific approximation. To this end, we present our insights toward harvesting domain-specific approximation as well as devise a proof-of-concept runtime, AutoFocus, that exploits dynamic domain-specific approximation. © 2017 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"The VFO-Driven Motion Planning and Feedback Control in Polygonal Worlds for a Unicycle with Bounded Curvature of Motion","2018","Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications","10.1007/s10846-017-0555-0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018751619&doi=10.1007%2fs10846-017-0555-0&partnerID=40&md5=76175e1118ae338f2d39f03e2c151a9d","Integrated motion planning and control for the purposes of maneuvering mobile robots under state- and input constraints is a problem of vital practical importance in applications of mobile robots such as autonomous transportation. Those constraints arise naturally in practice due to specifics of robot mechanical construction and the presence of obstacles in motion environment. In contrast to approaches focusing on feedback control design under the assumption of given reference motion or motion planning with neglection of subsequent feedback motion execution, we adopt a controller-driven motion planning paradigm, which has recently gained attention of many researchers. It postulates design of motion planning algorithms dedicated to specific feedback control policies, which compute a sequence of feedback control subtasks instead of classically planned open-loop controls or parametric paths. In this spirit, we propose a motion planning algorithm driven by the VFO (Vector Field Orientation) control law for the waypoint-following task. Presented analysis of the VFO control law reveals its beneficial properties, which are subsequently utilized to solve a generally nonlinear and non-convex optimal motion planning problem by formulating it as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The solution proposed in this paper yields a waypoint sequence, which is designed for execution by application of the VFO control law to drive a robot to a prescribed final configuration under an input constraint imposed by bounded curvature of robot motion and state constraints resulting from a convex decomposition of task space. Satisfaction of these constraints is guaranteed analytically and exactly, i.e., without utilization of numerical approximations. Moreover, for a given discrete set of possible waypoint orientations, the proposed algorithm computes plans optimal w.r.t. given cost functional, which can be any convex linear combination of quantities such as robot path length, curvature of robot motion, distance to imposed state constraints, etc. Furthermore, the planning algorithm exploits the possibility of both forward or backward movement of the robot to allow maneuvering in demanding environments. Generated waypoint sequences are a compact representation of a motion plan, which can be immediately executed with the VFO controller without any additional post-processing. Validity of the proposed approach has been confirmed by simulation studies and experimental motion execution with a laboratory-scale mobile robot. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, the existence of an end-to-end multi-hop path across VANET highly depends on the willingness of vehicles to cooperate with one another when it comes to data forwarding. Unlike the existing VANET connectivity studies that focused solely on fully-cooperative vehicular environments, this paper develops a mathematical model to explain the effect of non-cooperative vehicles on the end-to-end connectivity through the roadway segments of a VANET. First, this work characterizes some of the fundamental traffic-theoretic properties of VANETs in the presence of non-cooperative vehicles. Then, it proposes to alleviate the detrimental effect of non-cooperation on end-to-end path connectivity by exploiting Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as store-carry-and-forward nodes in a VANET.

The standard tool has been Side Scan Sonar (SSS) towed behind a surface vessel. Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) technology is not subject to the traditional range/resolution trade-off, and produces results of considerably higher quality than traditional SSS. In 2015 and 2016 a comprehensive mapping of wrecks in Skagerrak, a large deepwater area off the south coast of Norway was undertaken, using an interferometric SAS system deployed on an autonomous underwater vehicle. By examining data from two passes of one of the many historical wrecks that were detected in the survey area, we demonstrate how SAS can be used to produce very high resolution imagery and bathymetry of wreck sites. Furthermore, post processing techniques are applied to exploit the high information content inherent in SAS data, enhancing aspects of the data for relevant archaeological analysis and interpretation. We show in this paper how SAS technology represents significant improvements in our abilities to conduct high quality and high resolution seabed mapping. The adoption of this technology will both benefit archaeological research and provide knowledge for better decision making in underwater cultural heritage management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

Even the best localization systems based on GNSS cannot always reach this level of precision, especially in an urban environment, where the signal is disturbed by surrounding buildings and artifacts. Recent works have shown the advantage of using maps as a precise, robust, and reliable way of localization. Typical approaches use the set of current readings from the vehicle sensors to estimate its position on the map. The approach presented in this paper exploits a short-range visual lane marking detector and a dead reckoning system to construct a registry of the detected back lane markings corresponding to the last 240 m driven. This information is used to search in the map the most similar section, to determine the vehicle localization in the map reference. Additional filtering is used to obtain a more robust estimation for the localization. The accuracy obtained is sufficiently high to allow autonomous driving in a narrow road. The system uses a low-cost architecture of sensors and the algorithm is light enough to run on low-power embedded architecture. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Automated algorithms can detect these hazards from satellite imagery so that the relevant advice can be issued. The transparency and adaptability of these automated algorithms is important to cater to the needs of the end user, who should be able to readily interpret the hazard warning. This means avoiding heuristic techniques. Decision theory is a statistical tool that transparently considers the risk of false positives and negatives when detecting the hazard. By assigning losses to incorrect actions, ownership of the hazard warning is shared between the scientists and risk managers. These losses are readily adaptable depending on the perceived threat of the hazard. This study demonstrates how decision theory can be applied to the detection of atmospheric natural hazards using the example of volcanic ash during an ongoing eruption. The only observations are the difference in brightness temperature between two channels on the SEVIRI sensor. We apply the method to two volcanic eruptions: the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland, and the 2011 eruption of Puyehue-Cordón Caulle, Chile. The simple probabilistic method appears to work well and is able to distinguish volcanic ash from desert dust, which is a common false positive for volcanic ash. As is made clear, decision theory is a tool for decision support, providing transparency and adaptability, but it still requires careful input from scientists and risk managers. Effectively it provides a space where these groups of experts can meet and convert their shared understanding of a hazard into a choice of action. © 2017 The Authors.

A simplified model is employed and analyst expertise is leveraged to cheaply investigate the best LPSS design for the structural model. Convergence results from the simplified model are then used to design an efficient LPSS-based uncertainty study for the high-fidelity computational model investigation.

The design of such a strain sensor must fulfil several criteria, most important of all, it must be easily mounted or implanted into the tire and the elastic nature of the sensors must be synchronized with the deformation behaviour of the tire. To our knowledge, we evaluate for the first time, the piezoresistive characteristics of a composite developed from tire rubber, taking into account the morphology (distribution and dispersion of the fillers), filler network structure, crosslinking density and the stiffness (hardness) of the rubber matrix. We use a commercially available synthetic solution polymerized styrene butadiene rubber (SSBR) which is widely used in modern car tire industries. As the internal structure of the filler particles can rearrange or alter during deformation, it is extremely important to study the piezo-resistive performance with respect to crosslinking density, hardness and modulus of the rubber composites in details. The present paper focusses on the development of strain sensors by exploiting conductive elastomeric composites based on SSBR with conducting carbon fillers like carbon black and carbon nanotubes. The sensors can be stretched to several hundred percent of their original length and a sensitivity could be achieved as much as ∼1000 (gauge factor) in a given strain regime of ∼100%, while maintaining the mechanical robustness. Some of the mechanical properties like tensile strength (∼20 MPa), and modulus at 100% elongation are found to be quite satisfactory indicating the suitability of the materials for real applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

This traditional prevention quintet, turned into a sextet by smoking cessation, has been the basis of the “preventive personality” that formed in the twentieth century. Recent analyses of big data sets including genomic and physiological measurements have unleashed novel opportunities to estimate individual health risks with unprecedented accuracy, allowing to target preventive interventions to persons at high risk and at the same time to spare those in whom preventive measures may not be needed or even be harmful. To fully grasp these opportunities for modern preventive medicine, the established healthy life styles require supplementation by stratified prevention. The opportunities of these developments for life and health contrast with justified concerns: A “surveillance society”, able to predict individual behaviour based on big data, threatens individual freedom and jeopardises equality. Social insurance law and the new German Disease Prevention Act (Präventionsgesetz) rightly stress the need for research to underpin stratified prevention which is accessible to all, ethical, effective, and evidence based. An ethical and acceptable development of stratified prevention needs to start with autonomous individuals who control and understand all information pertaining to their health. This creates a mandate for lifelong health education, enabled in an individualised form by digital technology. Stratified prevention furthermore requires the evidence-based development of a new taxonomy of cardiovascular diseases that reflects disease mechanisms.

The calculation was carried out for three models: with a single control room and brigade of service, with a single control room and a specialized service, with several dispatch centers and specialized services. The aim of the work was to investigate the influence of the structural scheme of the organization of the dispatcher service of a high-rise building on the amount of operating costs and the time of processing and fulfilling applications. The problems of high-rise construction and their impact on the complication of exploitation are analyzed. The composition of exploitation activities of high-rise buildings is analyzed. The relevance of the study is justified by the need to review the role of dispatch services in the structure of management of the quality of buildings. Dispatching service from the lower level of management of individual engineering systems becomes the main link in the centralized automated management of the exploitation of high-rise buildings. With the transition to market relations, the criterion of profitability at the organization of the dispatching service becomes one of the main parameters of the effectiveness of its work.

The appearance of ascites is strongly related to portal hypertension, which leads to splanchnic arterial vasodilation, reduction of the effective circulating volume, activation of endogenous vasoconstrictor systems, and avid sodium and water retention in the kidneys. Bacterial translocation further worsens hemodynamic alterations of patients with cirrhosis and ascites. The first-line treatment of uncomplicated ascites is a moderate sodium-restricted diet combined with diuretic treatment. In patients who develop refractory ascites, paracentesis plus albumin represents the most feasible option. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement is a good alternative for selected patients. Other treatments such as vasoconstrictors and automated low-flow pumps are two potential options still under investigations. Ascites is associated with a high risk of developing further complications of cirrhosis such as dilutional hyponatremia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and/or other bacterial infections and acute kidney injury (AKI). Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is the most life-threatening type of AKI in patients with cirrhosis. The most appropriate medical treatment in patients with AKI-HRS is the administration of vasoconstrictors plus albumin. Finally, ascites impairs both the quality of life and survival in patients with cirrhosis. Thus, all patients with ascites should be evaluated for the eligibility for liver transplantation. The aim of this article is to review the management of patients with cirrhosis, ascites and HRS. © 2017, Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver.","Review","Final","Scopus"

However, these medical records are often encrypted to preserve the patient's privacy. Revealing the secret key used to encrypt these records to the emergency center would not only give unlimited unauthorized future access to the medical records but also pose privacy concerns for the patient. In this paper, we propose a secure medical records access scheme that can be used to serve the patient effectively. An emergency medical center is able to decrypt a patient's medical records without revealing the secret key used to encrypt them with the help of the patient's smart phone and the cloud server. We use proxy re-encryption scheme to trigger a re-encryption process at the cloud server by sending the required credentials. With the help of the cloud server, only a specific emergency center is able to decrypt the medical records and access the patient's medical history. Our scheme allows in-time and more efficient health care and recovery in extreme life-threatening situations. Our analysis and evaluations show that the proposed scheme can secure the medical records and preserve the privacy of the patient with acceptable computation and communication overhead. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Vision-based dangerous object detection is a crucial technology of autonomous driving. In previous work, dangerous object detection is generally formulated as a typical object detection problem and a distance-based danger assessment problem, separately. These two problems are usually dealt with using two independent models. In fact, vision-based object detection and distance prediction present prominent visual relationship. The objects with different distance to the camera have different attributes (pose, size and definition), which are very worthy to be exploited for dangerous object detection. However, these characteristics are usually ignored in previous work. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) method to jointly model object detection and distance prediction with a Cartesian product-based multi-task combination strategy. Furthermore, we mathematically prove that the proposed Cartesian product-based combination strategy is more optimal than the linear multi-task combination strategy that is usually used in MTL models, when the multi-task itself is not independent. Systematic experiments show that the proposed approach consistently achieves better object detection and distance prediction performances compared to both the single-task and multi-task dangerous object detection methods. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

They not only create barriers to entry to small firms in the economic domain, they also pose a serious threat to democracy by dominating public discourse and occupying a wide range of public spaces. Efforts to halt or reverse the growth of corporate power have been largely ineffective, in large part because they have been entirely reactive. In order for citizens to reclaim the economy and politics, a new strategy is necessary, one that starts by analyzing the source of corporate power. The method of analysis in this article is historical, specifically the history of changes in the United States of the legal instruments of incorporation and their relationship to emerging conditions in the economy and business. In the first half of the 19th century, corporations were chartered by state governments to carry out public benefit activities, particularly infrastructure projects. These mixed corporations lost favor during the depression of the 1840s and were replaced by private for-profit corporations that continued using the same debt financing instruments employed by states. They were also still regulated by the states that issued their charters. When corporations sought to avoid competition by creating cartels, they had difficulty maintaining discipline and discovered they needed new rights in order to gain permanent control of markets. In the 1890s, they were granted the status of “natural persons,” with the legal protections of citizens, but they also gained the right to buy other corporations, thereby solidifying their market power and making them largely autonomous from public control. Each transition was contested, but when it was completed, it seemed to the public as if corporations had always had their new powers. In order to regain the power to hold corporations accountable to the public, those old contested issues need to be brought back into public discourse, so that citizens might decide for themselves how much power corporations should have. © 2018 American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

An exploding number of vehicles such as drones or cars, in particular, are being controlled wirelessly or connected through networks. This has brought unanimous concern that today's networked vehicle systems are vulnerable to attacks and the results could be fatal. Unfortunately, in contrast to active investigation on the security of the vehicles themselves, sensors, or communication channels, existing approaches for these real-time, safety-critical systems do not take controllers into enough consideration. In order to protect the controller that performs the arithmetic operations using sensor measurements and generates command signals, we adopt homomorphic cryptography for the controller. It removes risks associated with the management of the secret key inside the controller, by eliminating the need to encrypt and decrypt the data for the mathematical operation within the controller. Specifically, we propose an efficient linearly homomorphic authenticated encryption (LinHAE) scheme for the ground control center of a multi-rotor drone, in a manner that enables real-time operation for safe autonomous flight. To facilitate the linear scheme, we design the ground controller targeted to allow state update using additions and multiplications by a system-specific constant. The proposed LinHAE guarantees the security against eavesdropping and forgery attacks, unlike homomorphic encryption alone that does not provide means to check whether the received signal at the drone side is authentic or compromised. We introduce a LinHAE with security and computational tractability, and describe how it can fit into the standard architecture for drone systems and how the specific controller is implemented. Building on these ingredients, we report the first successful operation of a multi-rotor flying robot that autonomously flies under the ground controller with real-time homomorphic authenticated encryption. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

A campaign took place for collecting: a) more than 150 ground control points using an RTK system, b) more than 20.000 high-resolution terrestrial and aerial images using cameras and Unmanned Aircraft Systems and c) 140 point clouds by a 3D Terrestrial Laser Scanner. The Structure from Motion method has been applied on the high-resolution terrestrial and aerial photographs, for producing accurate and very detailed 3D models of the damaged buildings of the Vrisa settlement. Additionally, two Orthophoto maps and Digital Surface Models have been created, with a spatial resolution of 5cm and 3cm, respectively. The first orthophoto map has been created just one day after the earthquake, while the second one, a month later. In parallel, 3D laser scanning data have been exploited in order to validate the accuracy of the 3D models and the RTK measurements used for the geo-registration of all the above-mentioned datasets. The significant advantages of the proposed methodology are: a) the coverage of large scale areas; b) the production of 3D models having very high spatial resolution and c) the support of post-earthquake management and reconstruction processes of the Vrisa village, since such 3D information can serve all stakeholders, be it national and/or local organizations. © Authors 2018.

Recent vector control campaigns have resulted in promising declines in incidence and prevalence of these diseases, notably malaria, but resistance to insecticides and drugs are on the rise, threatening to overturn these gains. Moreover, several vector-borne diseases have re-emerged, requiring prompt and effective response measures. To improve and properly implement vector control interventions, the behaviour of the vectors must be well understood with detailed examination of mosquito flight being an essential component. Current knowledge on mosquito behaviour across its life history is briefly presented, followed by an overview of recent developments in automated tracking techniques for detailed interpretation of mosquito behaviour. These techniques allow highly accurate recording and observation of mating, feeding and oviposition behaviour. Software programmes built with specific algorithms enable quantification of these behaviours. For example, the crucial role of heat on host landing and the multimodal integration of carbon dioxide (CO2) with other host cues, has been unravelled based on three-dimensional tracking of mosquito flight behaviour. Furthermore, the behavioural processes underlying house entry and subsequent host searching and finding can be better understood by analysis of detailed flight recordings. Further potential of these technologies to solve knowledge gaps is discussed. The use of tracking techniques can support or replace existing monitoring tools and provide insights on mosquito behaviour that can lead to innovative and more effective vector-control measures. © 2018 The Author(s).","Review","Final","Scopus"

Earlier, in order to handle this scalability issue; routing protocols were developed as a traditional solution that utilizes a flat organization to establish routes among the mobile nodes. However, the flat routing schemes present a static security restrains with single point dependency, which is inappropriate for MANET. Also, these security solutions failed to overcome certain drawbacks in managing a Public Key Infrastructure framework as: Nearest-Neighbour Search problem and cluster construction and maintenance complexities. Hence, an optimal hierarchical structure by overwhelming the drawbacks in the existing mechanisms should be regulated for solving the scalability problem in terms of topology control in MANET. In this paper, an efficient Hybrid Trust based Mobility Aware Clustering (HTMAC) strategy is proposed as the distributed trust based hierarchical solution for uncertain MANET system. Each node in the proposed scheme computes the trustworthiness of others with respect to the direct observations and recommendations, to develop a self-organized framework. To encounter challenges in node cooperation and security, hybrid trust computation is calculated in the proposed scheme. The originality of the proposed work combines clustering metrics with Voronoi hexagonal structure and Bayesian-Evidence trust management to predict the distributed security solution. Relevant simulation results demonstrate that our clustering model guarantees a secured and mobility-adaptive ad-hoc network with trustworthy mobile nodes. Thus the HTMAC scheme provides an efficient security solution that incorporate the promising features of clustering, Voronoi diagram and trust mechanisms. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

For instance, it can be used to discover proteins that are differentially expressed between two groups (e.g. two disease conditions, case vs. control, etc.) thus obtaining a set of potential biomarkers. This procedure requires a great deal of data processing in order to prepare data for analysis or to merge and integrate data from different sources. This kind of work is usually done manually (e.g. copying and pasting data into spreadsheet files), which is highly time consuming and distracts the researcher from other important, core tasks. Moreover, engaging in a repetitive process in a non-automated, handling-based manner is prone to error, thus threatening reliability and reproducibility. The objective of this paper is to present S2P, an open source software to overcome these drawbacks. Methods S2P is implemented in Java on top of the AIBench framework, and relies on well-established open source libraries to accomplish different tasks.

To support mitigation of potential threats, it is important to understand fine-scale sea turtle behaviors in a variety of habitats. Recent advancements in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) now make it possible to directly observe and study the subsurface behaviors and habitats of marine megafauna, including sea turtles. Here, we describe a ""smart"" AUV capability developed to study free-swimming marine animals, and demonstrate the utility of this technology in a pilot study investigating the behaviors and habitat of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea). We used a Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS (REMUS-100) AUV, designated ""TurtleCam,"" that was modified to locate, follow and film tagged turtles for up to 8 h while simultaneously collecting environmental data. The TurtleCam system consists of a 100-m depth rated vehicle outfitted with a circular Ultra-Short BaseLine receiver array for omni-directional tracking of a tagged animal via a custom transponder tag that we attached to the turtle with two suction cups. The AUV collects video with six high-definition cameras (five mounted in the vehicle nose and one mounted aft) and we added a camera to the animal-borne transponder tag to record behavior from the turtle's perspective. Since behavior is likely a response to habitat factors, we collected concurrent in situ oceanographic data (bathymetry, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a, turbidity, currents) along the turtle's track. We tested the TurtleCam system during 2016 and 2017 in a densely populated coastal region offCape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, where foraging leatherbacks overlap with fixed fishing gear and concentrated commercial and recreational vessel traffic. Here we present example data from one leatherback turtle to demonstrate the utility of TurtleCam. The concurrent video, localization, depth and environmental data allowed us to characterize leatherback diving behavior, foraging ecology, and habitat use, and to assess how turtle behavior mediates risk to impacts from anthropogenic activities.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation are highly recommended means of immediate treatment of these shockable arrhythmias and to resume spontaneous circulation. However, to increase efficacy of defibrillation by an automated external defibrillator (AED), an accurate distinction of shockable ventricular arrhythmias from non-shockable ones needs to be provided upfront. Therefore, in this work, we have proposed a novel tool for an automated differentiation of shockable and non-shockable ventricular arrhythmias from 2 s electrocardiogram (ECG) segments. Segmented ECGs are processed by an eleven-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Our proposed system was 10-fold cross validated and achieved maximum accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 93.18%, 95.32% and 91.04% respectively. Its high performance indicates that shockable life-threatening arrhythmia can be immediately detected and thus increase the chance of survival while CPR or AED-based support is performed.

Recent developments in low-cost remote sensing technologies offer an attractive means for early detection and management of environmental change. They are of great interest to the actors responsible for monitoring and managing forest health. The objective of this investigation was to develop, assess, and compare automated remote sensing procedures based on novel, low-cost hyperspectral imaging technology for the identification of bark beetle infestations at the individual tree level in urban forests. A hyperspectral camera based on a tunable Fabry-Pérot interferometer was operated from a small, unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) platform and a small Cessna-type aircraft platform. This study compared aspects of using UAV datasets with a spatial extent of a few hectares (ha) and a ground sample distance (GSD) of 10–12 cm to the aircraft data covering areas of several km2 and having a GSD of 50 cm. An empirical assessment of the automated identification of mature Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) trees suffering from infestation (representing different colonization phases) by the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) was carried out in the urban forests of Lahti, a city in southern Finland. Individual spruces were classified as healthy, infested, or dead. For the entire test area, the best aircraft data results for overall accuracy were 79% (Cohen's kappa: 0.54) when using three crown color classes (green as healthy, yellow as infested, and gray as dead). For two color classes (healthy, dead) in the same area, the best overall accuracy was 93% (kappa: 0.77). The finer resolution UAV dataset provided better results, with an overall accuracy of 81% (kappa: 0.70), compared to the aircraft results of 73% (kappa: 0.56) in a smaller sub-area. The results showed that novel, low-cost remote sensing technologies based on individual tree analysis and calibrated remote sensing imagery offer great potential for affordable and timely assessments of the health condition of vulnerable urban forests. © 2018 The Authors","Article","Final","Scopus"

Space computers must provide high performance and reliability (which are often at odds), using limited resources (power, size, weight, and cost), in an extremely harsh environment (due to radiation, temperature, vacuum, and vibration). As spacecraft shrink in size, while assuming a growing role for science and defense missions, the challenges for space computing become particularly acute. For example, processing capabilities on CubeSats (smaller class of SmallSats) have been extremely limited to date, often featuring microcontrollers with performance and reliability barely sufficient to operate the vehicle let alone support various sensor and autonomous applications. This article surveys the challenges and opportunities of onboard computers for small satellites (SmallSats) and focuses upon new concepts, methods, and technologies that are revolutionizing their capabilities, in terms of two guiding themes: hybrid computing and reconfigurable computing. These innovations are of particular need and value to CubeSats and other Smallsats. With new technologies, such as CHREC Space Processor (CSP), we demonstrate how system designers can exploit hybrid and reconfigurable computing on SmallSats to harness these advantages for a variety of purposes, and we highlight several recent missions by NASA and industry that feature these principles and technologies. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, in remote, rural, and disaster affected areas, it is difficult to construct such wireless networks due to the unavailability or inadequacy of cellular infrastructures. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be a good candidate to promptly construct the D2D-enabled wireless network. However, the assignment of the radio channels of the nodes (i.e., UAVs and user terminals) is challenging due to the availability of only a limited number of orthogonal channels and the interference issue resulted from using arbitrary channels. Furthermore, the dynamic topology and high mobility of nodes in such a combined UAV and D2D-based network make conventional channel assignment (CA) algorithm no longer suitable. In this paper, we formally address this problem, and demonstrate how partially overlapping channels (POCs) and game theory can be exploited to alleviate the problem. In this vein, we propose a distributed anticoordination game based POC assignment algorithm referred to as AC-POCA. In our proposed AC-POCA, the nodes use only local information to play the game, and reach a steady state, uniqueness of which is verified through analysis. Also, the upper bound of AC-POCA (i.e., price of anarchy) is analytically evaluated, which is corroborated by simulation results. In addition, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AC-POCA in terms of good throughput and low signaling overhead in a dynamic environment. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The main module of the method then searches for areas that pass a subset of pixel-intensity tests. A new set of reliable classification features has also been developed in the process. The overall framework has been kept uncomplicated intentionally in order to facilitate performance estimation, to avoid requiring dedicated training data, and to permit delayed real-time detection at sea on an autonomous underwater vehicle.

Heritage documentation in a post-natural disaster is a situation that requires rapid data acquisition on a hazardous field. On 12th of June 2017 an earthquake (Mw=6.3), south of Lesvos island, Greece occurred, which was devastating for the Vrisa village destroying, among many other buildings the main church. The Greek State decided from the first moment to restore the whole village, which was proclaimed as a ""traditional settlement"" since 2002, in its original place starting from the church and the school due to the symbolic meaning that those have to a local community. For this purpose, a 3D model of the church was requested by the authorities for damage assessment.

In the field of computer vision, it has become the workhorse for applications ranging from self-driving cars to surveillance and security. Whereas, deep neural networks have demonstrated phenomenal success (often beyond human capabilities) in solving complex problems, recent studies show that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of subtle perturbations to inputs that lead a model to predict incorrect outputs. For images, such perturbations are often too small to be perceptible, yet they completely fool the deep learning models. Adversarial attacks pose a serious threat to the success of deep learning in practice. This fact has recently led to a large influx of contributions in this direction. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on adversarial attacks on deep learning in computer vision. We review the works that design adversarial attacks, analyze the existence of such attacks and propose defenses against them. To emphasize that adversarial attacks are possible in practical conditions, we separately review the contributions that evaluate adversarial attacks in the real-world scenarios.

During water pollution source localization, there are complicated pollutant spreading conditions and pollutant concentrations vary in a wide range. This paper provides a scalable total solution, investigating a distributed localization method in wireless sensor networks equipped with mobile ultraviolet-visible (UV-visible) spectrometer probes. A wireless sensor network is defined for water quality monitoring, where unmanned surface vehicles and buoys serve as mobile and stationary nodes, respectively. Both types of nodes carry UV-visible spectrometer probes to acquire in-situ multiple water quality parameter measurements, in which a self-adaptive optical path mechanism is designed to flexibly adjust the measurement range. A novel distributed algorithm, called Dual-PSO, is proposed to search for the water pollution source, where one particle swarm optimization (PSO) procedure computes the water quality multi-parameter measurements on each node, utilizing UV-visible absorption spectra, and another one finds the global solution of the pollution source position, regarding mobile nodes as particles. Besides, this algorithm uses entropy to dynamically recognize the most sensitive parameter during searching. Experimental results demonstrate that online multi-parameter monitoring of a drinking water source area with a wide dynamic range is achieved by this wireless sensor network and water pollution sources are localized efficiently with low-cost mobile node paths. © 2018 by the authors.

If in this case the patient refuses treatment and in parallel there is a risk of serious damage to health, treatment can be carried out against the patient’s non-autonomous will under defined prerequisites. Due to its good and partly superior effectiveness in the treatment of severe and pharmacotherapy-resistant affective and psychotic disorders, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an important treatment option in such constellations. Aim: Description of the general principles and prerequisites of therapeutic measures against the patient’s will. Methods: Based on a case report, the application of ECT as a medical measure against the patient’s will is discussed and assessed in an interdisciplinary approach from clinical, legal, and ethical perspectives. Results and discussion: The (empirical) evidence on the general effectiveness of ECT, as well as its application against the will of patients with legal incapacity, clearly shows a positive benefit-risk ratio. When performed against the patient’s will, ECT as all compulsory medical interventions, represents a severe encroachment on the individual’s fundamental rights of both physical integrity and self-determination. Nevertheless, its application may be medically indicated, legally admissible and ethically appropriate in individual cases to prevent the threat of serious damage to the patient’s health. Ethical and legal prerequisites of treatment against the patient’s will should be evaluated by a multiprofessional team and the patient’s legal guardian should be involved from an early stage. © 2017, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH.","Review","Final","Scopus"

Storing PHRs in such a manner prohibits the patients from having complete control over their data and also may make the PHR system the target of security attacks. Towards this end, we proposed a new architecture, namely Personal Data Server overlay, where the data is stored on a set of Secure Portable Tokens (SPTs) that are under the control of individual users. SPTs are cheap, portable, and secure devices that combine the computing power and tamper-resistant properties of the smart cards and the storage capacity of NAND flash memory chips and they can act as a Personal Data Server (PDS). We need formal assurance of data availability when information is stored in PDS overlays. Thus, data must be replicated at multiple PDSs. We propose a data replication protocol that ensures that the PHRs for each user have replicas in the PDS overlay. It is crucial to ensure correctness of the data replication protocol. Consequently, we formalize the protocol using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and specify a number of desirable properties. We need to provide formal assurance of these properties in an automated manner. We demonstrate how the UML model can be transformed into Alloy using the UML-to-Alloy transformations. This obviates the need for the protocol designer to know Alloy. The analysis uncovers a significant error in the protocol.

Our study and in-depth analysis unveil that Mir and Nikooghadam’s authentication scheme is susceptible to smart card stolen attack, moreover anonymity violation is still possible despite the claim of Mir and Nikooghadam. We have utilized the random oracle model in order to perform security analysis. The analysis endorses that the proposed scheme is robust enough to provide protection against all potential attacks specially smart card stolen attack and user anonymity violation attack. Analysis is further substantiated through an automated software application ProVerif. The analysis also shows that proposed scheme is computationally efficient than Mir and Nikooghadam’s scheme. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Article","Final","Scopus"

More and more user-friendly, easy-to-pilot aerial and terrestrial drones are available off the shelf, and people can even remotely pilot them using their smartphones. This situation brings up the problem of keeping unauthorized drones away from private or sensitive areas, where they can represent a personal or public threat. With this motivation, after a survey of the existing solutions, we propose a WiFi-based approach aimed at detecting nearby aerial or terrestrial devices by performing statistical fingerprint analysis on wireless traffic. This novel detection technique, tested in a variety of real-life scenarios, proved able to efficiently detect and identify intruder drones in all the considered experimental setups, making it a promising unmanned aerial vehicle detection approach in the framework of amateur drone surveillance. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Multi-temporal repeated surveys may lead to geometric models that may be applied to analyze the glacier retreat under global warming conditions. Here the case study of Forni Glacier in the Italian Alps is presented. Thanks to the integration of point clouds obtained from the independent photogrammetric processing of ground-based and UAV blocks of images (captured on 2016), a complete 3D reconstruction also including vertical and sub-vertical surfaces has been achieved. This 3D model, compared to a second model obtained from a ground-based photogrammetric survey on September 2017, has been exploited to understand the precursory signal of a big collapse that might have involved tourists and hikers visiting the glacier ice tongue during summer.

Such unease has driven companies to exploit data as an avenue to better understand changing customer behavior. Data-mining techniques such as clustering and classification have been widely adopted in the mobile services sector to better understand customer retention. However, the effectiveness of these techniques is debatable due to the constant change and increasing complexity of the mobile market itself. This design study proposes an application of agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) as a novel approach to understanding customer behavior through the combination of market and social factors that emerge from data. External forces at play and possible company interventions can then be added to data-derived models. A dataset provided by a mobile network operator is utilized to automate decision-tree analysis and subsequent building of agent-based models. Popular churn modeling techniques were adopted in order to automate the development of models, from decision trees, and subsequently explore possible customer churn scenarios. ABMS is used to understand the behavior of customers and detect reasons why customers churned or stayed with their respective mobile network operators. A CART decision-tree method is presented that identifies agents, selects important attributes, and uncovers customer behavior – easily identifying tenure, location, and choice of mobile devices as determinants for the churn-or-stay decision. Word of mouth between customers is also explored as a possible influence factor. Importantly, methods for automating data-driven agent-based simulation model generation will support faster exploration and experimentation – including with those determinants from a wider market or social context. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Our approach exploits both colour and depth information recorded by a single RGB-D camera to better deal with negative factors such as lighting conditions and lane-like objects. In the approach, colour and depth images are first converted to a half-binary format and a 2D matrix of 3D points. They are then used as the inputs of template matching and geometric feature extraction processes to form a response map so that its values represent the probability of pixels being lane markers. To further improve the results, the template and lane surfaces are finally refined by principal component analysis and lane model fitting techniques. A number of experiments have been conducted on both synthetic and real datasets. The result shows that the proposed approach can effectively eliminate unwanted noise to accurately detect lane markers in various scenarios. Moreover, the processing speed of 20 frames per second under hardware configuration of a popular laptop computer allows the proposed algorithm to be implemented for real-time autonomous driving applications. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Acknowledging and incorporating these errors are crucial for accurate population estimation and improved management. To address this important gap in our knowledge, and to discover how flight plans should be selected to reduce overall error, we simulated contrasting UAV flight surveys over a range of population densities and dispersion patterns using different detection errors. We found that if a survey is carried out using an individual transect that low and slow flights consistently provide the best estimates of abundance and occupancy. However, the greater sampling area afforded by higher or faster flights resulted in more complex guidelines for estimates of abundance or occupancy over larger study areas. For highly clustered populations, especially those at low densities, a high and fast survey is preferable, as its greater area coverage best enables detection of local occupancy. The performance rankings of flight plans were sensitive to the underlying species detectability and, to a lesser extent, population density and aggregation. This suggests that UAV survey plans need to account for the spatial and movement ecology of target species, and that flight plans should adapt as an invasive species spreads, or a threatened species contracts. We encapsulate our results in a decision tree to guide flight planning for given survey objectives, detectability, and ecological context. Importantly, these findings provide guidance to other fields with transect-based surveys such as manned aviation and road or ground transects that trade-off sampling area and precision of estimates. Promising new technologies such as UAVs will be best utilized by ecologists if detection errors, and their interaction with the spatial ecology of the species, are carefully assessed. © 2018 The Authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, sometimes the consequences of fear can lead to responses that are maladaptive. Fear can have negative effects on learning. Research has focused on the experience of fear and its consequences among midwifery students during their undergraduate program. A qualitative analysis was conducted of interviews with ten midwifery students in different years of an undergraduate program. The data was analyzed through a content analysis approach. Two main categories and five subcategories emerged. The first category, areas of fear in midwifery students, consisted of the following subcategories: fear of doing harm, fear of encountering their first childbirth, and fear of penalties. The second category, consequences of fear, consisted of the following subcategories: general physical and psychological consequences and interference in adopting the professional role. In this study, fear not only raised the students’ stress levels thereby, leading to physical and psychological issues but also hindered their adoption of their professional role. These findings will potentially inform support and retention strategies within midwifery undergraduate programs in the future. Background Maternity care in Iran is provided mainly within a medical model of care. The majority of women give birth in hospital, where care is provided by midwives who work under the direction and supervision of an obstetrician. Midwives within the medically dominated system lack autonomy and have very little opportunity to gain experience in providing continuity of care for women as midwife-led models of care are rare. This practice context means that midwifery students have very little opportunity to gain experience in autonomous midwifery practice. Midwifery undergraduate program in Iran is for four years. Admission to the undergraduate program is implemented via a direct entry route. Nearly all of the midwifery students are school leavers with their first exposure to university and hospital systems. Most of the midwifery students have chosen this career without sufficient understanding about midwifery and the work that it involves (Arfaee et al., 2008). The midwifery undergraduate program comprises theoretical and clinical elements. After the first semester, students enter clinical settings under the supervision of their clinical instructors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

Despite the decreased cost and technological developments of platforms, sensors and software, the use of drones in carbonate geology has yet to be exploited. Nevertheless, drones offer multiple advantages over traditional field work or high-altitude remote sensing techniques, in that they enable the reconstruction of three dimensional models of inaccessible or unsafe outcrops, and can bridge the spatial scale gap in mapping between manual field techniques and airborne, high-altitude remote sensing methods. In this contribution, we present our methodology of structure from motion photogrammetry on drone-captured images and highlight opportunities and challenges of using drones in carbonate geological studies. Moreover, we apply this method to document the spatial distribution and dimensions of diagenetic dolomite geobodies in Carboniferous limestone host rock of the Picos de Europa, northern Spain. The results of our study indicate that dolomite geobodies occur preferentially near to strike-slip faults, rather than thrust faults or specific types of limestone host rock lithology, in the study area. The geobody dimensions appear to be related to the strain magnitude of the strike-slip faults. We propose that these identified links and controls are applicable to structurally-controlled dolomitization on a more general basis.

Despite its current mainstream use, new developments continue to emerge on its current use and potentially better methods for its testing and analysis. This review summarizes new developments in visual field testing and, in particular, standard automated perimetry. Recent findings Evidence-based guidance has recently been provided on the impact of testing frequency on the ability to detect visual field progression. An increasing body of evidence also highlights numerous factors that can impact the interpretation of visual field results currently considered reliable (e.g. the reliability indices themselves, fixation tracking parameters, and cognitive decline). More targeted visual field testing paradigms for central and peripheral visual fields have been explored, although further work is needed to understand their role in clinical care. Exploiting retinal imaging during visual field testing with fundus-tracked perimetry shows promise for improving precision. Thresholding algorithms that account for spatial and structural information and novel analytical techniques for longitudinal data could also improve the ability to detect and monitor visual field loss. New promising methods for objective and portable assessment of visual function have also emerged.

Usually occurring on the skin, early detection and diagnosis is strongly related to survival rates. Melanoma recognition is a challenging task that nowadays is performed by well trained dermatologists who may produce varying diagnosis due to the task complexity. This motivates the development of automated diagnosis tools, in spite of the inherent difficulties (intra-class variation, visual similarity between melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, among others). In the present work, we propose a system combining image analysis and machine learning to detect melanoma presence and severity. The severity is assessed in terms of melanoma thickness, which is measured by the Breslow index. Previous works mainly focus on the binary problem of detecting the presence of the melanoma. However, the system proposed in this paper goes a step further by also considering the stage of the lesion in the classification task. To do so, we extract 100 features that consider the shape, colour, pigment network and texture of the benign and malignant lesions. The problem is tackled as a five-class classification problem, where the first class represents benign lesions, and the remaining four classes represent the different stages of the melanoma (via the Breslow index). Based on the problem definition, we identify the learning setting as a partial order problem, in which the patterns belonging to the different melanoma stages present an order relationship, but where there is no order arrangement with respect to the benign lesions. Under this assumption about the class topology, we design several proposals to exploit this structure and improve data preprocessing. In this sense, we experimentally demonstrate that those proposals exploiting the partial order assumption achieve better performance than 12 baseline nominal and ordinal classifiers (including a deep learning model) which do not consider this partial order. To deal with class imbalance, we additionally propose specific over-sampling techniques that consider the structure of the problem for the creation of synthetic patterns. The experimental study is carried out with clinician-curated images from the Interactive Atlas of Dermoscopy, which eases reproducibility of experiments. Concerning the results obtained, in spite of having augmented the complexity of the classification problem with more classes, the performance of our proposals in the binary problem is similar to the one reported in the literature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In general, if an attacker has full knowledge about the bitstream structure and can make changes to the target FPGA design, she can alter the bitstream leading to key recovery. However, this requires challenging reverse-engineering steps in practice. We argue that this is a major reason why bitstream fault injection attacks have been largely neglected in the past. In this paper, we show that malicious bitstream modifications are i) much easier to conduct than commonly assumed and ii) surprisingly powerful. We introduce a novel class of bitstream fault injection (BiFI) attacks which does not require any reverse-engineering. Our attacks can be automatically mounted without any detailed knowledge about either the bitstream format or the design of the crypto primitive which is being attacked. Bitstream encryption features do not necessarily prevent our attack if the integrity of the encrypted bitstream is not carefully checked. We have successfully verified the feasibility of our attacks in practice by considering several publicly available AES designs. As target platforms, we have conducted our experiments on Spartan-6 and Virtex-5 Xilinx FPGAs. © 2016 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

As a matter of fact, the BYOD paradigm drastically reduces costs and increases productivity by allowing employees to carry out business tasks on their personal devices. However, it also increases the security concerns, since a compromised device could disruptively access the resources of the organization. The current mobile application distribution model based on application markets does not cope with this issue. In a previous work the concept of secure meta-market has been introduced as a mean to distribute mobile applications always guaranteed to comply with any given BYOD policy. This is achieved through a suitable combination of static analysis (i.e. model checking) and code instrumentation techniques. Although crucial, enforcing security policies over individual applications is not sufficient in general. Indeed, several well documented threats arise from the malicious interaction among applications which are harmless if isolated. In this paper, a novel technique for the security verification of groups of mobile app is proposed. The approach relies on partial model checking (PMC) to extend the existing security guarantees to groups of applications. The experimental results demonstrate the viability of the approach. Moreover, we show through a case study that even a fairly simple security policy can be violated by applications which are compliant if considered one by one. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

We conducted comprehensive investigation of Shigella serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance pattern in Xinjiang, identifying 458 Shigella isolates between 2008 to 2014. Shigella flexneri was identified as predominant species, and several S. flexneri serotypes were isolated, including atypical serotypes 1c, 2c, and 4s. Dominant S. flexneri serotypes were 2a, 1b, 2b, and Xv, different from those generally dominant in China. A hybrid serotype pattern was observed, which included the major Chinese serotypes (2a, Xv) and those predominant in Pakistan (1b, 2b). Shigella sonnei was shown to have a lower frequency compared with that generally observed in China, but an increasing trend of infections associated with this pathogen was observed. Furthermore, a high frequency of drug resistance and different Shigella antimicrobial resistance patterns were demonstrated as well, including very severe resistance phenotypes, such as multidrug resistance and resistance to frontline antibiotics. Seventy-five cephalosporin-resistant Shigella isolates were frequently identified with the resistance determinants that can undergo horizontal transfer, such as blaOXA, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, and integrons, facilitating the development of cephalosporin resistance among Shigella subtypes. Additionally, genetic analyses demonstrated that all 86 quinolone-resistant S. flexneri isolates possess 3±4 mutation sites in quinolone resistancedetermining regions, primarily contributing to their resistance to quinolone. However, S. sonnei isolates were not shown to be quinolone resistant. Co-resistance to cephalosporins and quinolones was detected in 17 S. flexneri isolates, and these isolates were additionally multidrug resistant and carried β-lactamase genes and quinolone-resistance determinants. As is demonstrated in this study, dominant serotypes of Shigella were distributed in unique trend with dangerous drug resistance patterns. Novel strategies are urgently required to prevent the development of drug resistance among diarrhea-inducing pathogens. © 2018 Liu et al.

Coherent integration of the data in conjunction with motion extraction and compensation turned this conventional Doppler radar into a one-dimensional inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR), which produced the detailed image of a mini drone. This result paves the way for a fully intelligent classification system with multiple sensors for countering the LSS-UAS threat. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The pipeline of the framework consists of two main phases. First, the considered input UAV image is subdivided into a grid of tiles, which are processed thanks to an opportune representation and a multilayer perceptron classifier providing thus tile-wise multilabel prediction probabilities. In the second phase, a multilabel CRF model is applied to integrate spatial correlation between adjacent tiles and the correlation between labels within the same tile, with the objective to improve iteratively the multilabel classification map associated with the considered input UAV image.

A tailless variant of the configuration and a variant with attached double vertical tail are investigated. The damping derivatives are determined by means of the aerodynamic response to forced harmonic oscillations. The required data for the determination of the damping derivatives are obtained from time-accurate Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations. The calculation methodology for the pitch-, yaw-, and roll-damping derivatives for arbitrary freestream conditions is described and a short evaluation of the approach is presented. Angle of attack and sideslip angle trends as well as the effect of the double vertical tail on the dynamic stability are investigated. The damping derivative of every considered type of motion exhibits significant non-linearities with respect to the freestream condition for angles of attack larger than 8 ∘. The pitch-damping and roll-damping derivative indicate a dynamically stable behavior at all considered freestream conditions for the configuration with and without vertical tail. The yaw-damping characteristic is more critical. Both configurations exhibit unstable behavior at several freestream conditions. The vertical tail, however, considerably improves the yaw-damping characteristic of the SAGITTA configuration. © 2018, Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

We can ill afford the attitude that, as we grow the global community, we can believe the better nature of man is one of harmony. Rather, the idea of connectivity breeds new types of threats, from local, regional, national, international, and most recently global terrorism, to classic, or traditional, conflicts, wars and proxies. The question gets to be, are these threats real, imagined, or contrived by sensationalism in the news media? Is 'fake news' really fake, partially fake, sometimes fake or is the claim simply a moniker to mask and confuse the public? Regardless of the answers, global security concerns are on the rise. From reality television of doomsday 'preppers', to the 24/7 saturation of real-time updates around the world, it is easy to see the direction the global community is moving towards. Self-protection in the new cold war has been trending upward. Therefore, innovation towards advanced technologies aimed to address this trend have increased significantly as well. In order to support the demands for these technologies, the supply base and a new supply chain model needs to be developed so that cycle time reduction and time to market, in this case, the defense market, will need to improve. This talk will cover topics ranging from an overview of the top U.S. Defense contractors and show examples of state of the art technologies developed to protect and defend the United States and its allies. Examples of global conflict trends will lead into the needs for a variety of technologies currently being developed and deployed to address the needs for global security.

A range of approaches have been used to study the complex way in which QS works, these tools combine biology, physics, and mathematics. We discuss here how a multidisciplinary perspective is ideal to study QS and present an example of QS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a human pathogen. In this bacterial species, QS coordinates the expression of virulence factors, that are public goods utilized by the whole population of bacteria regardless if they invested or not in their production. Hence, public good production is a cooperative behavior, susceptible to be exploited by non-public good producers, known as social cheaters. These individuals, which are QS-deficient, are also less able to tolerate oxidative stress. Our group has shown that pyocyanin (which promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species) produced by the wild-type population may work as a policing mechanism to select functional QS systems in this bacterium. Using an agent-based model (ABM) we are able to confirm that indeed this compound increases the fitness of the cooperative QS proficient individuals.We further explore, with the ABM, how the bacterial environment diffusion properties may be contributing to stabilize QS in certain growth conditions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

Attackers and criminals, even without knowing the context of the transmitted data, with simple eavesdropping on the wireless links, may benefit a lot from linking activities to the identities of patient’s sensors and medical staff members. These vulnerabilities apply to all tiers of the mHealth system. A new anonymous mutual authentication scheme for three-tier mobile healthcare systems with wearable sensors is proposed in this paper. Our scheme consists of three protocols: Protocol-1 allows the anonymous authentication nodes (mobile users and controller nodes) and the HSP medical server in the third tier, while Protocol-2 realizes the anonymous authentication between mobile users and controller nodes in the second tier, and Protocol-3 achieves the anonymous authentication between controller nodes and the wearable body sensors in the first tier. In the design of our protocols, the variation in the resource constraints of the different nodes in the mHealth system are taken into consideration so that our protocols make a better trade-off among security, efficiency and practicality. The security of our protocols are analyzed through rigorous formal proofs using BAN logic tool and informal discussions of security features, possible attacks and countermeasures. Besides, the efficiency of our protocols are concretely evaluated and compared with related schemes. The comparisons show that our scheme outperforms the previous schemes and provides more complete and integrated anonymous authentication services. Finally, the security of our protocols are evaluated by using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications and the SPAN animator software. The simulation results show that our scheme is secure and satisfy all the specified privacy and authentication goals. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In SEAT, a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) enabled smartphone communicates with registration devices to track the journey for pricing without any human intervention. SEAT is vigilant toward the energy consumption of the BLE device under various conditions, and security and privacy threats to the overall ecosystem. We develop models for energy consumption and latency for BLE devices under the influence of mutual interference based on experiments with 32 BLE devices. We utilize these models to develop an energy-efficient protocol for SEAT that is secure and privacy preserving.

In particular, the need for safe and repeatable conditions in automated driving testing is now defining a new challenge: to extend the use of the tool to nonprofessional drivers. Quality of the motion control strategies in generating both realistic and feasible inputs to the driver is therefore, more than ever, a crucial aspect. The motion strategies are implemented in the so-called motion cueing algorithms (MCAs). A recently proposed effective approach to MCA is based on model predictive control (MPC), as it is well suited to solve constrained optimal control problems and to take advantage of models of the human sensing system. However, the predictive aspect of the algorithm has not been exploited yet, due to the hard real-Time requirement when using long prediction windows. In this paper, a real-Time implementation of an MPC-based MCA with predictive feature is presented, endowed with an on-line switching policy to a nonpredictive algorithm when the expected driver behavior is considered unreliable. The motion action based on the actual driver behavior and the expected one are considered in the same procedure, thus fully exploiting the availability of a perceptive model. An optimal tuning procedure is also proposed, based on a multiobjective optimization, where both performance improvement due to the prediction exploitation, and robustness to varying driver behaviour are considered. Finally, a characterization of the driver skill level is proposed and validated in an experimental environment for the specific case of the vertical DOF. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

An unknown number of people had traumatic amputations of one or more extremities. Use of unmanned Israeli drones for surveillance and armed attacks on Gaza was evident, but exact figures on numbers of drone strikes on Gaza are not available. The aim of this study was to explore the medical consequences of strikes on Gaza with different weapons, including drones. METHODS: We studied a cohort of civilians in the Gaza Strip who had one of more traumatic limb amputation during the Israeli military attacks between 2006 and 2016. The study was done at The Artificial Limb and Polio Center (ALPC) in the Gaza Strip where most patients are treated and trained after amputation. We used standardised forms and validated instruments to record date and mechanism of injury, self-assessed health, socioeconomic status, anatomical location and length of amputation, comorbidity, and the results of a detailed clinical examination. FINDINGS: The studied cohort consisted of 254 Paletinian civilians (234 [92%] men, 20 [8%] women, and 43 [17%] children aged 18 years and younger) with traumatic amputations caused by different weapons. 216 (85%) people had amputations proximal to wrist or ankle, 131 (52%) patients had more than one major amputation or an amputation above the knee, or both, and 136 (54%) people were injured in attacks with Israeli drones, including eight (40%) of the women. The most severe amputations were caused by drone attacks (p=0·0001). Extremity injuries after drone attacks led to immediate amputation more often than with other weapons (p=0·014). Patients injured during cease-fire periods were younger than patients injured during periods of declared Israeli military operations (p=0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Weapons fired on the Gaza Strip from Israeli drones caused severe injuries in surviving Palestinian civilians. Drone-fired missiles resulted in major amputations in almost all victims who had limb losses. Substantially more severe injuries were inflicted by the drone-launched explosives than by other weapons used during the Gaza War. Traumatic amputations caused by drones were often immediately complete. One limitation of our study is that it does not elucidate injury patterns in victims with fatal injuries.None.

In the emergency response, the crucial exploitation of technological advances should obtain and efficiently organize high-scale reliable geospatial data for the early warning, impact, and recovery phases. Fulfilling these issues, among others, the Copernicus EMS, has played by now an important role in immediate and extensive damage reconnaissance, as in the case of Centre Italy. Nevertheless, the use of remote sensing data is still affected by a problem of point-of-view, scale and detectable detail. Nadir images, airborne or satellite, in fact, strongly limited the confidence level of these products. The subjectivity of the operator involvement is still an open issue, both in the first fieldwork assessment, and in the following operational approach of interpretative damage detection and rapid mapping production. To overcome these limits, the introduction of UAV platforms for photogrammetric purposes, has proven to be a sustainable approach in terms of time savings, operators' safety, reliability and accuracy of results: the nadir and oblique integration can provide large multiscale models, with the fundamental information related to the façades conditions. The presented research, conducted within the Central Italy earthquakes events, will focus on potentialities and limits of UAV photogrammetry in the two documented sites: Pescara del Tronto and Accumoli. Here, the aim is not limited to describe a series of strategies for georeferencing, blocks orientation and multitemporal co-registration solutions, but also to validate the implemented pipelines as a workflow that could be integrated in the operative intervention for emergency response in early impact activities. Thus, it would be possible to use this 3D metric products as a reference-data for significative improvements of reliability in typical visual inspection and mapping, flanking the traditional nadir airborne- or satellite-based products. The UAV acquisitions performed in two damaged villages are displayed, in order to underline the implication of the spatial information embedded in DSM reconstruction and 3D models, supporting more reliable damage assessments. © Authors 2018.

A particular attention is given to the on-line hyperparameters optimization, since atmospheric phenomena are strongly dynamical processes. The obtained local map is then exploited by a trajectory planner based on a stochastic optimization algorithm. The goal is to generate feasible trajectories which exploit air flows to perform energy-efficient flights, while maximizing the information collected along the mission.

Assessment of MPAs effectiveness requires synchronous sampling of protected and non-protected areas at multiple spatial and temporal scales. We used an autonomous underwater vehicle to map benthic communities in replicate 'no-take' and 'general-use' (fishing allowed) zones within three MPAs along 7o of latitude. We recorded 92 taxa and 38 morpho-groups across three large MPAs. We found that important habitat-forming biota (e.g. massive sponges) were more prevalent and abundant in no-take zones, while short ephemeral algae were more abundant in general-use zones, suggesting potential short-term effects of zoning (5±10 years). Yet, short-term effects of zoning were not detected at the community level (community structure or composition), while community structure varied significantly among MPAs. We conclude that by allowing rapid, simultaneous assessments at multiple spatial scales, autonomous underwater vehicles are useful to document changes in marine communities and identify adequate scales to manage them. This study advanced knowledge of marine benthic communities and their conservation in three ways. First, we quantified benthic biodiversity and abundance, generating the first baseline of these benthic communities against which the effectiveness of three large MPAs can be assessed. Second, we identified the taxonomic resolution necessary to assess both short and long-term effects of MPAs, concluding that coarse taxonomic resolution is sufficient given that analyses of community structure at different taxonomic levels were generally consistent. Yet, observed differences were taxa-specific and may have not been evident using our broader taxonomic classifications, a classification of mid to high taxonomic resolution may be necessary to determine zoning effects on key taxa. Third, we provide an example of statistical analyses and sampling design that once temporal sampling is incorporated will be useful to detect changes of marine benthic communities across multiple spatial and temporal scales. © 2018 Ferrari et al.

In this paper, the fog-framework for intelligent public safety in vehicular environment (FISVER) framework applies fog computing in smart video surveillance-based STS to enhance crime assistance in a cost-efficient way. Through fog-FISVER, in-vehicle and fog infrastructures support autonomous and real-time crime detection on public bus services. A fog-FISVER laboratory testbed prototype was created and extensive evaluations in a real testbed were performed. Results show that fog-FISVER delivers outstanding system performance and device survivability behavior over typical STS use cases. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"Optimization of OpenStreetMap building footprints based on semantic information of oblique UAV images","2018","Remote Sensing","10.3390/rs10040624","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045994589&doi=10.3390%2frs10040624&partnerID=40&md5=8f5d2a1522351486567b1e754d331d88","Building footprint information is vital for 3D building modeling. Traditionally, in remote sensing, building footprints are extracted and delineated from aerial imagery and/or LiDAR point cloud. Taking a different approach, this paper is dedicated to the optimization ofOpenStreetMap (OSM) building footprints exploiting the contour information, which is derived from deep learning-based semantic segmentation of oblique images acquired by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). First, a simplified 3D buildingmodel of Level ofDetail 1 (LoD1) is initialized using the footprint information fromOSMand the elevation information fromDigital SurfaceModel (DSM). In parallel, a deep neural network for pixel-wise semantic image segmentation is trained in order to extract the building boundaries as contour evidence. Subsequently, an optimization integrating the contour evidence from multi-view images as a constraint results in a refined 3D building model with optimized footprints and height. Our method is leveraged to optimize OSM building footprints for four datasets with different building types, demonstrating robust performance for both individual buildings and multiple buildings regardless of image resolution. Finally, we compare our result with reference data from German Authority Topographic-Cartographic Information System (ATKIS). Quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal that the original OSM building footprints have large offset, but can be significantly improved from meter level to decimeter level after optimization. © 2018 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"A novel DTI-QA tool: Automated metric extraction exploiting the sphericity of an agar filled phantom","2018","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","10.1016/j.mri.2017.07.027","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032706779&doi=10.1016%2fj.mri.2017.07.027&partnerID=40&md5=49a417ae7428a0843f4e95cb1815150e","Purpose To develop a quality assurance (QA) tool (acquisition guidelines and automated processing) for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data using a common agar-based phantom used for fMRI QA. The goal is to produce a comprehensive set of automated, sensitive and robust QA metrics. Methods A readily available agar phantom was scanned with and without parallel imaging reconstruction. Other scanning parameters were matched to the human scans. A central slab made up of either a thick slice or an average of a few slices, was extracted and all processing was performed on that image. The proposed QA relies on the creation of two ROIs for processing: (i) a preset central circular region of interest (ccROI) and (ii) a signal mask for all images in the dataset. The ccROI enables computation of average signal for SNR calculations as well as average FA values. The production of the signal masks enables automated measurements of eddy current and B0 inhomogeneity induced distortions by exploiting the sphericity of the phantom. Also, the signal masks allow automated background localization to assess levels of Nyquist ghosting. Results The proposed DTI-QA was shown to produce eleven metrics which are robust yet sensitive to image quality changes within site and differences across sites. It can be performed in a reasonable amount of scan time (~ 15 min) and the code for automated processing has been made publicly available. Conclusions A novel DTI-QA tool has been proposed. It has been applied successfully on data from several scanners/platforms. The novelty lies in the exploitation of the sphericity of the phantom for distortion measurements. Other novel contributions are: the computation of an SNR value per gradient direction for the diffusion weighted images (DWIs) and an SNR value per non-DWI, an automated background detection for the Nyquist ghosting measurement and an error metric reflecting the contribution of EPI instability to the eddy current induced shape changes observed for DWIs. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"Trigger alerts associated with laboratory abnormalities on identifying potentially preventable adverse drug events in the intensive care unit and general ward","2018","Therapeutic Advances in Drug Safety","10.1177/2042098618760995","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044787661&doi=10.1177%2f2042098618760995&partnerID=40&md5=3a7bc3934340e17ff324a7737d1a7d23","Background: Medication safety strategies involving trigger alerts have demonstrated potential in identifying drug-related hazardous conditions (DRHCs) and preventing adverse drug events in hospitalized patients. However, trigger alert effectiveness between intensive care unit (ICU) and general ward patients remains unknown. The objective was to investigate trigger alert performance in accurately identifying DRHCs associated with laboratory abnormalities in ICU and non-ICU settings. Methods: This retrospective, observational study was conducted at a university hospital over a 1-year period involving 20 unique trigger alerts aimed at identifying possible drug-induced laboratory abnormalities. The primary outcome was to determine the positive predictive value (PPV) in distinguishing drug-induced abnormal laboratory values using trigger alerts in critically ill and general ward patients. Aberrant lab values attributed to medications without resulting in an actual adverse event ensuing were categorized as a DRHC. Results: A total of 634 patients involving 870 trigger alerts were included. The distribution of trigger alerts generated occurred more commonly in general ward patients (59.8%) than those in the ICU (40.2%). The overall PPV in detecting a DRHC in all hospitalized patients was 0.29, while the PPV in non-ICU patients (0.31) was significantly higher than the critically ill (0.25) (p = 0.03). However, the rate of DRHCs was significantly higher in the ICU than the general ward (7.49 versus 0.87 events per 1000 patient days, respectively, p < 0.0001). Although most DRHCs were considered mild or moderate in severity, more serious and life-threatening DRHCs occurred in the ICU compared with the general ward (39.8% versus 12.4%, respectively, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Overall, most trigger alerts performed poorly in detecting DRHCs irrespective of patient care setting. Continuous process improvement practices should be applied to trigger alert performance to improve clinician time efficiency and minimize alert fatigue. © 2018, © The Author(s), 2018.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Successful treatment of cardiac arrest is extremely time sensitive, and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) where possible significantly increases the probability of survival. Placement of AEDs in public locations can improve survival by enabling bystanders to treat victims of cardiac arrest prior to the arrival of emergency medical responders, thus shortening the time between collapse and treatment. However, since the exact locations of future cardiac arrests cannot be known a priori, AEDs must be placed strategically in public locations to ensure their accessibility in the event of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest emergency. In this paper, we propose a data-driven optimization model for deploying AEDs in public spaces while accounting for uncertainty in future cardiac arrest locations. Our approach involves discretizing a continuous service area into a large set of scenarios, where the probability of cardiac arrest at each location is itself uncertain. We model uncertainty in the spatial risk of cardiac arrest using a polyhedral uncertainty set that we calibrate using historical cardiac arrest data. We propose a solution technique based on row-and-column generation that exploits the structure of the uncertainty set, allowing the algorithm to scale gracefully with the total number of scenarios. Using real cardiac arrest data from the City of Toronto, we conduct an extensive numerical study on AED deployment public locations. We find that hedging against cardiac arrest location uncertainty can produce AED deployments that outperform an intuitive sample average approximation by 9%-15% and cuts the performance gap with respect to an ex post model by half. Our findings suggest that accounting for cardiac arrest location uncertainty can lead to improved accessibility of AEDs during cardiac arrest emergencies and the potential for improved survival outcomes. © 2018 INFORMS.","Article","Final","Scopus"

A magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck Taiwan on June 2, 2013, and triggered a landslide, which resulted in the formation of a natural landslide dam in the South Qingshuigou watershed near the Phoenix Valley Bird Park. To efficiently estimate the landslide's scale and evaluate the landslide dam's stability, this study used an unmanned aerial vehicle to photograph the landslide scene and employed image-based modeling (IBM) approaches to construct a three-dimensional (3D) model of the landslide scene. This study also performed coordinate transformation using length constraints to obtain a 3D model at an absolute scale. The dimensionless blockage index (DBI) could be calculated for the landslide dam by using spatial information retrieved from the constructed 3D model. The volume of this earthwork was estimated as 136,588 m3, and the DBI of the landslide dam was 3.37, indicating that the landslide dam was unstable. The constructed model provides timely and precise 3D geoinformation and can be used as a reference for aftermath strategizing. © 2018, Chinese Soil and Water Conservation Society.

We aimed to determine the ability of this device, incorporated in clinical work flow, to detect retinopathy in persons with type 2 diabetes. Methods: Retinal images of persons treated by the Hoorn Diabetes Care System (DCS) were graded by the IDx-DR device and independently by three retinal specialists using the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy severity scale (ICDR) and EURODIAB criteria. Agreement between specialists was calculated. Results of the IDx-DR device and experts were compared using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), distinguishing between referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) and vision-threatening retinopathy (VTDR). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated. Results: Of the included 1415 persons, 898 (63.5%) had images of sufficient quality according to the experts and the IDx-DR device. Referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) was diagnosed in 22 persons (2.4%) using EURODIAB and 73 persons (8.1%) using ICDR classification. Specific intergrader agreement ranged from 40% to 61%. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of IDx-DR to detect RDR were 91% (95% CI: 0.69–0.98), 84% (95% CI: 0.81–0.86), 12% (95% CI: 0.08–0.18) and 100% (95% CI: 0.99–1.00; EURODIAB) and 68% (95% CI: 0.56–0.79), 86% (95% CI: 0.84–0.88), 30% (95% CI: 0.24–0.38) and 97% (95% CI: 0.95–0.98; ICDR). The AUC was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.88–1.00; EURODIAB) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.83–0.92; ICDR). For detection of VTDR, sensitivity was lower and specificity was higher compared to RDR. AUC's were comparable. Conclusion: Automated grading using the IDx-DR device for RDR detection is a valid method and can be used in primary care, decreasing the demand on ophthalmologists. © 2017 The Authors.

The objective of this study is to verify whether the tax loads on wastewater discharges applied in Spain are effective, allowing the costs of secondary and tertiary treatments to be financed. First, the revenues collected from taxes related to the discharge of wastewater in the different Spanish regions, which reach an average value of 0.72 €/m3, are analysed. Second, the costs of secondary wastewater treatment, prolonged aeration, activated sludge with nutrient removal, and activated sludge without nutrient removal are studied. Additionally, the costs of tertiary treatments, with environmental objectives and for reuse purposes, are considered. The analysis carried out reveals high heterogeneity in the amounts collected through taxes in the different Autonomous Communities. In some cases, these amounts do not cover the costs of the treatments. An urgent review is therefore required of the financing systems applied in order to secure a level of income that can cover all the exploitation and investment costs incurred. © 2018 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The rise of Big Data has resulted in the accumulation of a massive volume of visual data which requires proper and fast analysis. Deep Learning methods are powerful approaches towards this task as training with large amounts of data exhibiting high variability has been shown to significantly enhance their effectiveness, but often requires expensive computations and leads to models of high complexity. When the objective is to analyze visual content in massive datasets, the complexity of the model becomes crucial to the success of the model. In this paper, a lightweight deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is introduced for the purpose of face detection, designed with a view to minimize training and testing time, and outperforms previously published deep convolutional networks in this task, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To train this lightweight deep network without compromising its efficiency, a new training method of progressive positive and hard negative sample mining is introduced and shown to drastically improve training speed and accuracy. Additionally, a separate deep network was trained to detect individual facial features and a model that combines the outputs of the two networks was created and evaluated. Both methods are capable of detecting faces under severe occlusion and unconstrained pose variation and meet the difficulties of large scale real-world, real-time face detection, and are suitable for deployment even in mobile environments such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It has the unique ability among yeasts to produce geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate derived terpenoids such as carotenoids and in particular the high value pigment astaxanthin. Objective: In order to fully exploit the industrial potential of Xanthophyllomyces using modern industrial biotechnology approaches the further development of “omic” resources in this organism are required to build on the now sequenced and annotated genome. To contribute to this goal, the present study has developed and implemented an efficient metabolite profiling system comprised of, quenching, extraction and associated GC–MS and UPLC analysis. Method: Four quenching methods and five extraction methods compatible with GC–MS and UPLC profiling were tested and validated by analysing steady state metabolite changes of Xanthophyllomyces cultivated at laboratory scale in liquid shake culture at lag, exponential and early and late stationary phases. Results: A customised Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS) library has been created for Xanthophyllomyces, over 400 compounds are present in the library of which 78 are detected and quantified routinely in polar and non-polar derived extracts. A preliminary biochemical network has been constructed. Over a standardised laboratory growth cycle, changes in metabolite levels have been determined to create reference point for future strain improvement approaches and the initial biochemical network construction. Correlation analysis has illustrated that astaxanthin formation correlates positively with different sectors of intermediary metabolism (e.g. the TCA cycle intermediates and amino acid formation), “short” saturated fatty acids and β-carotene, while other metabolites are reduced in response to astaxanthin production. These sectors of intermediary metabolism offer potential future targets for the manipulation resulting in the generation of strains with improved titres of given terpenoids.

Recent advances in technology allow combat drones to operate as a swarm-similar to their vespidae counterparts. An overly simplistic conclusion would suggest that the current legal tapestry applicable to solo drone usage would 'automatically' apply to drones acting collectively or as a swarm. This article, however, posits a more controversial position that the technological uniqueness of individual drones acting as a swarm necessitates a more thorough deconstruction of the applicable legal framework. In other words, does the unique way in which a swarm operates lawfully comply with both jus ad bellum and jus in bello parameters? Crucial to this discussion, is to examine the extent to which a swarm is programmed both offensively and defensively-with a view to exploring the algorithm of an automated response from other drones within the swarm. Within this broader question, the article seeks to scrutinise two specific areas. First, to what extent is the drone swarm's architecture calibrated to comply with the cardinal self-defence parameters of necessity and proportionality should the swarm be attacked? And secondly, is the 'swarm' capable of being fully jus in bellow compliant in terms of distinction and proportionality and the duty to take precautions ('The General Principles'). Would, for example, the chain of command structure in a drone swarm encompass the concept of the 'reasonable military commander' when it comes to targeting? The purpose of this article is not to reopen, or indeed close the debate surrounding artificial intelligence and its ethical implications.

A clean ECG is often desired for proper treatment of cardiac ailments. However, in the real scenario, ECG signals are corrupted with various noises during acquisition and transmission. In this article, an efficient ECG denoising methodology using combined empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and adaptive switching mean filter (ASMF) is proposed. The advantages of both EMD and ASMF techniques are exploited to reduce the noises in the ECG signals with minimum distortion. Unlike conventional EMD based techniques, which reject the initial intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) or utilize a window based approach for reducing high-frequency noises, here, a wavelet based soft thresholding scheme is adopted for reduction of high-frequency noises and preservation of QRS complexes. Subsequently, an ASMF operation is performed to enhance the signal quality further. The ECG signals of standard MIT-BIH database are used for the simulation study. Three types of noises in particular white Gaussian noise, Electromyogram (EMG) and power line interference contaminate the test ECG signals. Three standard performance metrics namely output SNR improvement, mean square error, and percentage root mean square difference measure the efficacy of the proposed technique at various signal to noise ratio (SNR). The proposed denoising methodology is compared with other existing ECG denoising approaches. A detail qualitative and quantitative study and analysis indicate that the proposed technique can be used as an effective tool for denoising of ECG signals and hence can serve for better diagnostic in computer-based automated medical system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

The type of propulsion denotes selecting such a system, among a wide range of the available ones, which allows the best exploitation of the airframe characteristics as well as generating proper thrust in order to comply with all the assumed requirements. This study analyses various propulsion systems currently used in UAVs, paying particular attention to their characteristics which are essential to conduct a specific mission, including geological and photogrammetric research missions. The most common task of UAVs is reconnaissance, and its most significant parameters are indurance, speed, flight altitude and payload taken on board. All of these are largely linked to the type of used propulsion. In conclusion, the above analysis indicates that a future propulsion system for an UAV should be designed on the basis of a rotary piston combustion engine or a flat engine (boxer type). It should be digitally controlled, so that the operator receives information about the engine's working parameters, in real time. © 2017 Institute of Marine Engineering, Science & Technology.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Forest environments are among these environments of interest where autonomous exploration and navigation is desirable with the caveat that GPS may not be accessible for localization of the drone. Motivated by the latter, in this paper we present a methodology for autonomous navigation of UAV in forest environments, paying particular attention to competences desired in autonomous navigation, namely detection and evasion of trees. Obstacle detection is performed using a deep neural network approach trained with a limited database but that exploits transferred learning from a well-known network architecture called Alexnet. In addition to the detection of a tree, a direction of avoidance is also recognized, this is, evasion to the left or to the right is obtained with the same learning scheme. Our approached was assessed in simulation by using the simulator Gazebo and also in a real outdoors scenario populated with trees. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Today, sophisticated attackers can adapt by maximally sabotaging machine-learning classifiers via polluting training data, rendering most recent machine learning-based malware detection tools (such as DREBIN, DROIDAPIMINER, and MAMADROID) ineffective. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of constructing crafted malware samples; examine how machine-learning classifiers can be misled under three different threat models; then conclude that injecting carefully crafted data into training data can significantly reduce detection accuracy. To tackle the problem, we propose KUAFUDET, a two-phase learning enhancing approach that learns mobile malware by adversarial detection. KUAFUDET includes an offline training phase that selects and extracts features from the training set, and an online detection phase that utilizes the classifier trained by the first phase. To further address the adversarial environment, these two phases are intertwined through a self-adaptive learning scheme, wherein an automated camouflage detector is introduced to filter the suspicious false negatives and feed them back into the training phase. We finally show that KUAFUDET can significantly reduce false negatives and boost the detection accuracy by at least 15%. Experiments on more than 250,000 mobile applications demonstrate that KUAFUDET is scalable and can be highly effective as a standalone system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

Any error in accurately reaching the intermediate point leads to maneuver replanning and hence puts extra computational burden on the planner. Addressing the issue, this letter formulates the problem in a point-to-ray framework connecting the parking position to all points in a neighborhood of the intermediate point. Exploiting its asymptotic convergence, four parameter logistic (4PL) curve based S-shaped path is proposed as a solution with a single maneuver connecting the intermediate point neighborhood to the parking position. Inherent to the 4PL curve, the maneuver presents a continuous steering profile with zero steering angle at the ends. Parking slot collision avoidance and steering limit of the vehicle are satisfied by deducing closed-form analytic conditions on the two design parameters. Together with the robustness to intermediate point variation, comparison with existing approaches highlights computational and design advantages. The proposed approach is validated using a double-tracked Ackermann steering vehicle model. © 2016 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this study, we propose a novel trust model for UAVNs that is based on the behavior and mobility pattern of UAV nodes and the characteristics of inter-UAV channels. The proposed trust model consists of four parts: direct trust section, indirect trust section, integrated trust section, and trust update section. Based on the trust model, the concept of a secure link in UAVNs is formulated that exists only when there is both a physical link and a trust link between two UAVs. Moreover, the metrics of both the physical connectivity probability and the secure connectivity probability between two UAVs are adopted to analyze the connectivity of UAVNs. We derive accurate and analytical expressions of both the physical connectivity probability and the secure connectivity probability using stochastic geometry with or without Doppler shift. Extensive simulations show that compared with the physical connection probability with or without malicious attacks, the proposed trust model can guarantee secure communication and reliable connectivity between UAVs and enhance network performance when UAVNs face malicious attacks and other security risks. © 2018, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

They have claimed that their scheme is secured against some possible cryptographic attacks. However, we have analyzed that the scheme of Li et al cannot preserve all the proclaimed security goals, which are given as follows: (1) It is not withstanding password-guessing, user impersonation, insider, and smartcard theft attacks, and (2) it fails to facilitate user anonymity property. To remedy these above-mentioned security flaws, we have proposed an efficient three factor–based authentication scheme in a multiserver environment using elliptic curve cryptography.

Further, the informal security analysis confirms that the suggested scheme can withstand against some possible mentioned attacks. Later, the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications tool is incorporated to ensure its security against passive and active attacks.

This algorithm adopts the distributed control architecture which divides the global optimization problem into several local optimization problems. Each UAV is able to solve its own local optimization problem, and then make the optimal decision for the multi-UAV system through the information exchange among UAVs. The search-attack mission planning process is divided into two phases, the one is waypoints generation under constraints of UAV's maneuverability, collision avoidance and maximum range, the other is path generation which takes account of the threat avoidance. In the first phase, an improved distributed ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is presented to carry out the mission planning and generate waypoints. Considering the range constraint of UAV, a new state transition rule is designed to guide UAV back to its initial point within the maximum flight range. In the second phase, Dubins curve is employed to smoothly connect the waypoints generated by the ACO. As for the unexpected threats during the flight, an online threat avoidance method is proposed to replan the paths.

In this paper, we present our vision to create such a beneficial link by designing a multimodal scheme for object detection, recognition, and mapping based on the fusion of stereo camera frames, point cloud Velodyne LIDAR scans, and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) basic safety messages (BSMs) exchanges using VANET protocols. Exploiting the high similarities in the underlying manifold properties of the three data sets, and their high neighborhood correlation, the proposed scheme employs semi-supervised manifold alignment to merge the key features of rich texture descriptions of objects from 2-D images, depth and distance between objects provided by 3-D point cloud, and the awareness of self-declared vehicles from BSMs' 3-D information including the ones not seen by camera and LIDAR. The proposed scheme is applied to create joint pixel-to-point-cloud and pixel-to-V2V correspondences of objects in frames from the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite, using a semi-supervised manifold alignment, to achieve camera-LIDAR and camera-V2V mapping of their recognized objects. We present the alignment accuracy results over two different driving sequences and show the additional acquired knowledge of objects from the various input modalities. We also study the effect of the number of neighbors employed in the alignment process on the alignment accuracy. With proper choice of parameters, the testing of our proposed scheme over two entire driving sequences exhibits 100% accuracy in the majority of cases, 74%-92% and 50%-72% average alignment accuracy for vehicles and pedestrians and up to 150% additional object recognition of the testing vehicle's surrounding. © 2013 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

From the Nash property it follows that if the evader deviates from its maximum potential speed then the capture time shall not increase for a pursuer that does not deviate from its Nash equilibrium motion strategy. However, it is not immediately clear how the pursuer could exploit that evader's deviation from its maximum potential speed, which might correspond to situations where the evader's capabilities may degrade with time, for example, battery depletion in an autonomous vehicle, or fatigue in an animal evader. This can be considered as a scenario of an evader in which the set of admissible controls varies with time. In the present paper we consider such scenario. In our first result, we propose an alternative strategy for the pursuer, which, for certain scenarios, further reduces the capture time compared to the strategy based on the maximum potential evader's speed. In our second result, we show that, under non-anticipative strategies, a pursuer strategy that uses the instantaneous evader speed alone, does not always guarantee to improve the payoff for the pursuer, nor the capture of the evader. Hence, we conclude that the evader's location is the relevant information for the pursuer to know. Later, we present vision-based control laws that implement the optimal pursuer strategy. The optimal pursuer strategy is characterized by a partition of the reduced space (a representation of the game in the pursuer's body-attached coordinate system) in which each region maps to an optimal pursuer action. We consider the case for which the pursuer is equipped with an omnidirectional catadioptric camera. Finally, in our third result we show that the location of the evader on the image can be directly used by the pursuer to define its motion strategy, in spite of the distortion of the state space suffered on the image. That is, the pursuer is able to apply its motion strategy using the image without explicitly reconstructing the evader's position. This approach is computationally efficient, and robust to occlusions and noise in the image. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

Zero day attacks further exasperate the threat landscape by requiring a shift to defense in depth approaches. With the tightly coupled nature of cyber components with the physical domain, these attacks have the potential to cause significant damage if safety-critical applications such as automobiles are compromised. Moving target defense techniques such as instruction set randomization (ISR) have been commonly proposed to address these types of attacks. However, under current implementations an attack can result in system crashing which is unacceptable in CPS. As such, CPS necessitate proper control reconfiguration mechanisms to prevent a loss of availability in system operation. This paper addresses the problem of maintaining system and security properties of a CPS under attack by integrating ISR, detection, and recovery capabilities that ensure safe, reliable, and predictable system operation. Specifically, we consider the problem of detecting code injection attacks and reconfiguring the controller in real-time.

Compared to the traditional cloud-computing- based infrastructure, computing and storage facilities are available near end users in edge computing. Moreover, with the widespread popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), huge amounts of information will be shared between edge devices and UAVs in the coming years. In this scenario, traffic surveillance using UAVs and edge computing devices is expected to become an integral part of the next generation intelligent transportation systems. However, surveillance in ITS requires uninterrupted data sharing, cooperative decision making, and stabilized network formation. Edge computing supports data processing and analysis closer to the deployed machines (i.e., the sources of the data). Instead of simply storing data and missing the opportunity to capitalize on it, edge devices can analyze data to gain insights before acting on them. Transferring data from the vehicle to the edge for real-time analysis can be facilitated by the use of UAVs, which can act as intermediate aerial nodes between the vehicles and edge nodes. However, as the communication between UAVs and edge devices is generally done using an open channel, there is a high risk of information leakage in this environment. Keeping our focus on all these issues, in this article, we propose a data-driven transportation optimization model where cyber-threat detection in smart vehicles is done using a probabilistic data structure (PDS)- based approach. A triple Bloom filter PDS- based scheduling technique for load balancing is initially used to host the real-time data coming from different vehicles, and then to distribute/collect the data to/from edges in a manner that minimizes the computational effort. The results obtained show that the proposed system requires comparatively less computational time and storage for load sharing, authentication, encryption, and decryption of data in the considered edge-computing-based smart transportation framework. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The latter may include moored systems, autonomous vehicles, and even human divers. For reasons that have to do with the unavailability of Global Positioning System underwater, cost reduction, and simplicity of operation, there is currently a surge of interest in the development of range-based multiple target localization systems that rely on the computation of the distances between the targets and a number of sensor nodes deployed at the ocean surface, equipped with acoustic range measuring devices. In the case of a single target, there is a wealth of literature on the problem of optimal acoustic sensor placement to maximize the information available for target localization using trilateration methods. In the case of multiple targets, however, the literature is scarce. Motivated by these considerations, we address the problem of optimal sensor placement for multiple underwater target positioning. In this setup, we are naturally led to a multiple objective optimization problem, the solution of which allows for the analysis of the trade-offs involved in the localization of the targets simultaneously. To this end, we resort to tools from estimation theory and multi-objective optimization. For each target, the function to be minimized (by proper choice of the sensor configuration) is related to the determinant of the corresponding Fisher information matrix, which yields information on the minimum possible covariance of the error with which the position of the target can be estimated using any non-biased estimator. To deal with the fact that more than one target is involved, we exploit the concept of multiple objective Pareto-optimal solutions to characterize the best possible accuracy with which each of the targets can be positioned, given constraints on the desired positioning accuracy of the other targets. Simulation examples illustrate how, for a three-sensor network and two targets, it is possible to define an optimal sensor configuration that yields large positioning accuracy for both targets simultaneously, using convex optimization tools. When more than two targets are involved, however, more than three sensors are required to exploit an adequate trade-off of the accuracy with which each target can be positioned by resorting to non-convex and Pareto-optimization tools. We show how in this case the optimal sensor configurations depend on the Pareto weights assigned to each of the targets, as well as on the number of sensors, the number of targets, and the uncertainty with which the positions of the targets are known a priori. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This approach, however, introduces additional cognitive burdens for users and lowers the whole authentication mechanism acceptability to the point of making it unusable. On the contrary, what is really needed to fight the onslaught of automated attacks to users data and privacy is to first tell human and computers apart and then distinguish among humans to guarantee correct authentication. Such an approach is capable of completely thwarting any automated attempt to achieve unwarranted access while it allows keeping simple the mechanism dedicated to recognizing the legitimate user. This kind of approach is behind the concept of Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA), yet CAPTCHA leverages cognitive capabilities, thus the increasing sophistication of computers calls for more and more difficult cognitive tasks that make them either very long to solve or very prone to false negatives. We argue that this problem can be overcome by substituting the cognitive component of CAPTCHA with a different property that programs cannot mimic: the physical nature. In past work we have introduced the Completely Automated Public Physical test to tell Computer and Humans Apart (CAPPCHA) as a way to enhance the PIN authentication method for mobile devices and we have provided a proof of concept implementation. Similarly to CAPTCHA, this mechanism can also be used to prevent automated programs from abusing online services.

"Natural ocean acidification at Papagayo upwelling system (north Pacific Costa Rica): Implications for reef development","2018","Biogeosciences","10.5194/bg-15-2349-2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045945058&doi=10.5194%2fbg-15-2349-2018&partnerID=40&md5=6fa6aeb73875546f8ab2c79a6af1316c","Numerous experiments have shown that ocean acidification impedes coral calcification, but knowledge about in situ reef ecosystem response to ocean acidification is still scarce. Bahía Culebra, situated at the northern Pacific coast of Costa Rica, is a location naturally exposed to acidic conditions due to the Papagayo seasonal upwelling. We measured pH and pCO2 in situ during two non-upwelling seasons (June 2012, May-June 2013), with a high temporal resolution of every 15 and 30 min, respectively, using two Submersible Autonomous Moored Instruments (SAMI-pH, SAMI-CO2). These results were compared with published data from the 2009 upwelling season. Findings revealed that the carbonate system in Bahía Culebra shows a high temporal variability. Incoming offshore waters drive intra-and interseasonal changes. Lowest pH (7.8) and highest pCO2 (658.3 μatm) values measured during a cold-water intrusion event in the non-upwelling season were similar to those minimum values reported from upwelling season (pHD7.8, pCO2 D643.5 μatm), unveiling that natural acidification also occurs sporadically in the non-upwelling season. This affects the interaction of photosynthesis, respiration, calcification and carbonate dissolution and the resulting diel cycle of pH and pCO2 in the reefs of Bahía Culebra. During the non-upwelling season, the aragonite saturation state (Ωa/ rises to values of >3.3 and during the upwelling season falls below 2.5. The Ωa threshold values for coral growth were derived from the correlation between measured Ωa and coral linear extension rates which were obtained from the literature and suggest that future ocean acidification will threaten the continued growth of reefs in Bahía Culebra. These data contribute to building a better understanding of the carbonate system dynamics and coral reefs' key response (e.g., coral growth) to natural low-pH conditions, in upwelling areas in the eastern tropical Pacific and beyond. © Author(s) 2018.","Article","Final","Scopus"

While acute myocardial infarction (colloquially: heart attack), has multiple proximate causes, proximate etiology cannot be determined by a blood-based diagnostic test. We enrolled a suitable patient cohort and conducted a non-targeted quantification of plasma metabolites by mass spectrometry for developing a test that can differentiate between thrombotic MI, non-thrombotic MI, and stable disease. A significant challenge in developing such a diagnostic test is solving the NP-hard problem of feature selection for constructing an optimal statistical classifier. Objective: We employed a Wisdom of Artificial Crowds (WoAC) strategy for solving the feature selection problem and evaluated the accuracy and parsimony of downstream classifiers in comparison with traditional feature selection techniques including the Lasso and selection using Random Forest variable importance criteria. Materials and methods: Artificial Crowd Wisdom was generated via aggregation of the best solutions from independent and diverse genetic algorithm populations that were initialized with bootstrapping and a random subspaces constraint. Results/Conclusions: Strong evidence was observed that a statistical classifier utilizing WoAC feature selection can discriminate between human subjects presenting with thrombotic MI, non-thrombotic MI, and stable Coronary Artery Disease given abundances of selected plasma metabolites. Utilizing the abundances of twenty selected metabolites, a leave-one-out cross-validation estimated misclassification rate of 2.6% was observed. However, the WoAC feature selection strategy did not perform better than the Lasso over the current study. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This is typically obtained by imposing a large positive static margin (SM). The main drawbacks of this approach are the resulting understeering behavior of the vehicle and, often, a decrease in peak lateral grip due to oversized rear tire characteristics. On the other hand, a lower SM can cause a greater time delay in the vehicle's response which hardens the control of a vehicle at limit handling for a human being. By introducing advanced autonomous driving features into future vehicles, the human factor can be excluded in limit handling manoeuvers (e.g., obstacle avoidance occurrences) and, consequently, the need for a high SM (i.e., high controllability for human drivers) can be avoided. Therefore, it could be possible to exploit the passive vehicle dynamics and enhance the performance, both in terms of peak grip and transient response. The goal of this article is to explore if a decrease in SM can lead to a performance advantage on an obstacle avoidance manoeuver when the vehicle is driven by a robotic controller. This is achieved by analyzing the behavior of various vehicle models with different SMs and peak lateral acceleration on a nonstandard double lane change manoeuver. After having characterized the dynamic response of the various models in both steady-state and unsteady-state, several tests are run on a Driver-in-Motion (DiM) dynamic driving simulator driven by human drivers. The same tests are run again in a Model-in-the-Loop (MiL) simulation where the vehicle is controlled by means of a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). The results show that the robotic controller outperforms a human driver and poses interesting design challenges for autonomous vehicles in terms of passive stability and active controllers to modify vehicle stability online. © 2018 SAE International.

It is assumed that the attacker has limited resources and can only manipulate a certain number of sensors. In most of the existing observer design approaches for the systems with unknown inputs even in the absence of attacks, the observer matching condition should be satisfied. To overcome this restriction, a novel switched observer is proposed, where the matched unknown inputs will be completely compensated by means of the outputs and the mismatched part will be suppressed in terms of L2-gain rejection property. Meanwhile, the observer can provide an attack-resilient state estimation. Compared with the existing results, the proposed observer can guarantee that the resulting observer error system is stable with unknown input attenuation level γ that can be optimized. Finally, a simulation example of an unmanned ground vehicle is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Researchers have focused on developing algorithms that optimize robotic movement to achieve desired trajectories, and it's a general understanding that route optimization problems are difficult to solve mathematically. Humans, on the other hand, tend to optimize their day-to-day activities intuitively. In order to achieve the desired results, the brain exploits a multi-level filtering approach, where the macro features are weighted in the first layer and the microfeatures in further layers. This optimization inside the brain interestingly, leave distinct traces in electroencephalography (EEG) plots. Based on the observations, we propose to use artificial neural networks to classify the EEG data, which intuitively should give a high classification rate, because the human brain also exploits a network of neurons to classify auditory (time-series) and visual (spatial) data. In this paper, we discuss the performances of 14- channel and 5-channel EEG headsets for robotic applications. Data is acquired from 20 subjects corresponding to four different tasks. Using neural nets, we have been successfully able to classify the EEG input into four different classes. We get an overall classification accuracy of 98.8% for 14-channel and 84.5% 5-channel system.

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive method for planar object detection and recognition. First, the data association of LIDAR and camera is set up to acquire colorized laser scans, which simultaneously contain both color and geometrical information. Second, we combine three color spaces of RGB, HSV, and CIE L∗a∗b∗ with laser reflectivity as an aggregation-based feature vector. Third, the 3-D geometrical characteristics of planar objects that contain planarity, size, and aspect ratio are exploited to further reduce false alarm. Fourth, in order to increase robustness to any viewpoint variation, we present a new virtual camera-based rectification method to synthesize fronto-parallel views of refined object descriptors in 3-D space. Finally, experimental results achieved under a variety of challenging conditions show that integration of color space aggregation and laser reflectivity is superior to individuals. Specifically, the proposed perspective distortion rectification method remarkably eliminates false recognition error by 45.5%.

However, this technology is not only confined to cars. It is equally applicable to trucks and there is speculation that it will be autonomous trucks that will hit the roads first because they operate in ‘a less complicated traffic environment’ and are therefore ideal starting points for the coming automated vehicle market.1 For example, in May 2015, authorities granted a license to Daimler to test its self-driving trucks on public roads in the US State of Nevada.2 These use a series of different technologies, including video cameras and radar, which, when applied in an incremental way, allow drivers to take breaks, although there must always be a qualified driver at the wheel.3 It is clear to see the benefits of selfdriving trucks to trucking companies, who could use them to transport goods across much longer distances and without all of the scheduled breaks than is presently possible with human truck drivers. But what about the impact on the image of the retained drivers themselves? Traditionally, truck drivers have been men and this representation is well-entrenched in a variety of media. Does the introduction of self-driving truck technology represent an attack on the masculinist truck driving culture as portrayed in TV shows such as ‘Ice Road Truckers’ or ‘Outback Truckers’. If so, is such a change to be encouraged or is the historical image (though objectionable to some) worthy of protection? Given that self-driving trucks could be available for purchase from the middle of the coming decade, the socio-legal aspects of self-driving truck technology will be reflected on and the degree to which this issue can be contemplated at law addressed. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Here we compare, for the first time, vertical profiles of the aerosol mass concentration derived from light detection and ranging (lidar) observations and in situ measurements using an optical particle counter on board a UAV during moderate and weak Saharan dust episodes. Agreement between the two measurement methods was within experimental uncertainty for the coarse mode (i.e. particles having radii &gt; 0.5ĝ€μm), where the properties of dust particles can be assumed with good accuracy.

In this paper, we use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to relay the message of an OBU and improve the communication performance of VANETs against smart jammers that observe the ongoing OBU and UAV communication status and even induce the UAV to use a specific relay strategy and then attack it accordingly. More specifically, the UAV relays the OBU message to another roadside unit (RSU) with a better radio transmission condition if the serving RSU is heavily jammed or interfered. The interactions between a UAV and a smart jammer are formulated as an antijamming UAV relay game, in which the UAV decides whether or not to relay the OBU message to another RSU, and the jammer observes the UAV and the VANET strategy and chooses the jamming power accordingly. The Nash equilibria of the UAV relay game are derived to reveal how the optimal UAV relay strategy depends on the transmit cost and the UAV channel model. A hotbooting policy hill climbing-based UAV relay strategy is proposed to help the VANET resist jamming in the dynamic game without being aware of the VANET model and the jamming model. Simulation results show that the proposed relay strategy can efficiently reduce the bit error rate of the OBU message and thus increase the utility of the VANET compared with a Q-learning-based scheme. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, related security and privacy threats are a major holdback. With increasing focus on using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) for autonomous navigation and related applications, it is important to provide robust navigation solutions, yet signal spoofing for illegal or covert transportation and misleading receiver timing is increasing and now frequent. Hence, detection and mitigation of spoofing attacks has become an important topic. Several contributions on spoofing detection have been made, focusing on different layers of a GNSS receiver. This paper focuses on spoofing detection utilizing self-contained sensors, namely inertial measurement units (IMUs) and vehicle odometer outputs. A spoofing detection approach based on a consistency check between GNSS and IMU/odometer mechanization is proposed. To detect a spoofing attack, the method analyses GNSS and IMU/odometer measurements independently during a pre-selected observation window and cross checks the solutions provided by GNSS and inertial navigation solution (INS)/odometer mechanization. The performance of the proposed method is verified in real vehicular environments. Mean spoofing detection time and detection performance in terms of receiver operation characteristics (ROC) in sub-urban and dense urban environments are evaluated. © 2018 by the authors.

In this paper, we apply prospect theory to formulate a subjective smart attack game for the UAV transmission, in which a smart attacker Eve makes subjective decisions to choose the attack type such as jamming, spoofing, and eavesdropping without knowing the attack detection accuracy of the UAV system, and the UAV transmit power on multiple radio channels is chosen to resist smart attacks. Reinforcement-learning-based UAV power allocation strategies are proposed to achieve the optimal power allocation against smart attacks without knowing the attack model and the channel model in the dynamic game. A deep Q-learning-based UAV power allocation strategy combines Q-learning and deep learning to accelerate the learning speed for the case with a large number of channel states and attack modes. Simulation results show that our proposed UAV power allocation strategy can suppress the attack motivation of subjective smart attackers and increase the secrecy capacity and the utility of the UAV system. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The purpose was to combine both benefits of AutoPlanning optimization and MCO (APMCO) for achieving an individual volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plan according to the clinically achieved patient-specific tradeoff among conflicting priorities. The preclinical investigation of this optimization approach for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) radiotherapy was performed and compared to general MCO VMAT. Methods: A total of 60 NPC patients with various stages were enrolled in this study. General MCO and APMCO plans were generated for each patient on the treatment planning system. The differences between two planning schemes were evaluated and compared. Results: All plans were capable of achieving the prescription requirement. The planning target volume coverage and conformation number were remarkably similar between general MCO and APMCO plans. There were no significant differences in most of organs at risk (OARs) sparing. However, in APMCO plans, relatively remarkable decreases were observed in the mean dose (Dmean) to the glottic larynx and pharyngeal constrictor muscles. The reductions of average Dmean to the two OARs were 10.5% (p < 0.0001) and 8.4% (p < 0.0001), respectively. APMCO technique was found to increase the planning time for an average of approximately 5 h and did not lead to a significant increase of monitor units compared to general MCO. Conclusions: The potential of the APMCO strategy is best realized with a clinical implementation that exploits individual generation of Pareto surface representations without manual interaction. It also assists physicians to ensure navigation in a more efficient and straightforward manner. © 2018 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

Typically, such areas are documented in so-called impact maps which are based on the detection of bomb craters. This paper proposes a method for the automatic detection of bomb craters in aerial wartime images that were taken during the Second World War. The object model for the bomb craters is represented by ellipses. A probabilistic approach based on marked point processes determines the most likely configuration of objects within the scene. Adding and removing new objects to and from the current configuration, respectively, changing their positions and modifying the ellipse parameters randomly creates new object configurations. Each configuration is evaluated using an energy function. High gradient magnitudes along the border of the ellipse are favored and overlapping ellipses are penalized. Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling in combination with simulated annealing provides the global energy optimum, which describes the conformance with a predefined model. For generating the impact map a probability map is defined which is created from the automatic detections via kernel density estimation. By setting a threshold, areas around the detections are classified as contaminated or uncontaminated sites, respectively. Our results show the general potential of the method for the automatic detection of bomb craters and its automated generation of an impact map in a heterogeneous image stock. © Authors 2018.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To overcome these problems, we propose a semisupervised learning (SSL) road detection method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and a weakly supervised learning (WSL) method based on conditional GANs. Specifically, in our SSL method, the generator generates the road detection results of labeled and unlabeled images, and then they are fed into the discriminator, which assigns a label on each input to judge whether it is labeled. Additionally, in WSL method we add another network to predict road shapes of input images and use them in both generator and discriminator to constrain the learning progress. By training under these frameworks, the discriminators can guide a latent annotation process on the unlabeled data; therefore, the networks can learn better representations of road areas and leverage the feature distributions on both labeled and unlabeled data.

The research shows that this system has high energy density. Three new system configurations corresponding to different working cycles were investigated respectively, and their performance parameters in terms of net power, energy density and global efficiency were discussed. The results of the simulation show that the reaction between the direct return of high temperature steam and the aluminum enhances the temperature of steam, and the system's performance is reduced. An evaporator component and a solid heat exchanger are added into system in order to make full use of the solid product heat, and so the system performance is improved. The addition of double combustion chamber and wall cooling structure avoid the design of the high temperature compressor component on one hand, and solve the thermal protection of the combustion chamber on the other hand, which brings the improvement of the system performance.

Traditionally, monitoring depth of cover at scale has been carried out qualitatively by means of visual inspection. We proceed instead to rely on airborne remote sensing techniques to obtain densely sampled ground surface point measurements from the pipeline's right of way, from which we determine depth of cover using automated algorithms. Proceeding in our manner presents a reproducible, quantitative approach to monitoring depth of cover, yet the demands thus made by the scale of real-world pipeline monitoring scenarios on compute and storage resources can be substantial. We show that the scalability afforded by the cloud can be leveraged to address such scenarios, distributing the algorithms we employ to take advantage of multiple compute nodes and exploiting elastic storage.

However, their experimental verification is still an open and challenging task. This letter proposes a verification strategy based on near-field scans. An unmanned aerial vehicle carrying a test source is used to excite the array from a limited set of spatial points, located in the radiating near-field region.

However, its efficiency has always been limited by the primary method of reading barcodes with a handheld laser scanner. Compared with this reading by line-of-sight at close proximity, vision-based barcode reading algorithms can further improve efficiency, particularly if accompanied by automated data collection platforms such as drones. This paper introduces algorithms that are able to automatically extract barcodes from video data, and verifies their feasibility and promise for inventory management in warehousing applications. Three key techniques corresponding to different recognition levels are proposed: For a known barcode region, a Harris corner detector and Hough transform-based algorithm is applied to quickly estimate the angle by which the frame area needs to rotate to orient the bars vertically for information extraction. Then, the idea of exploiting connectivity and geometry property of barcode areas is proposed to directly recognise multiple barcode regions in a single video frame to eliminate reading difficulties resulting from interactive influence of multiple juxtaposed barcodes, and to save computation time by only processing frame areas of interest for valid barcodes. In addition, a histogram difference-based fast extraction strategy is designed to further improve efficiency by reducing duplicate information processing. Finally, the performance of each technique is evaluated by analysing video data from a large logistics warehouse, demonstrating satisfactory performance in inventory management applications. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Those advances encompass the ever increasing innovative digital and remote mobile devices being operated on the users’ end. Due to the openness of critical system, the service providers in such networks are facing security challenges to authenticate those mobile devices on the field, and delivering services. In this scenario, theMulti-server authentication (MSA) framework seems to be a promising solution that enables its subscribers to avail services from different servers without getting registered to each server individually. In last few years many MSA protocols depending on RC-Offline authentication during mutual authentication, have been presented. However, to date, there is no efficient MSA scheme to our knowledge that is free of all three weaknesses, simultaneously. That is, 1) free from storage of server-based parameters (public keys or other values) in smart card by registration authority, 2) free from the assumption of publishing of server-based public keys publicly and 3) free from a single secret sharing with all servers so that it could avoid server masquerading (insider) attack. Considering these limitations, we present a multi-server authentication protocol that withstands above drawbacks using lightweight cryptographic operations.

Use cases include the labelling of malicious samples according to families during triage of suspected malware. However, automated algorithms are vulnerable to attacks. An attacker could carefully manipulate the sample to force the algorithm to produce a particular output. In this paper we discuss one such attack on Android malware classifiers. We design and implement a prototype tool, called IagoDroid, that takes as input a malware sample and a target family, and modifies the sample to cause it to be classified as belonging to this family while preserving its original semantics. Our technique relies on a search process that generates variants of the original sample without modifying their semantics. We tested IagoDroid against RevealDroid, a recent, open source, Android malware classifier based on a variety of static features. IagoDroid successfully forces misclassification for 28 of the 29 representative malware families present in the DREBIN dataset. Remarkably, it does so by modifying just a single feature of the original malware. On average, it finds the first evasive sample in the first search iteration, and converges to a 100% evasive population within 4 iterations. Finally, we introduce RevealDroid*, a more robust classifier that implements several techniques proposed in other adversarial learning domains. Our experiments suggest that RevealDroid* can correctly detect up to 99% of the variants generated by IagoDroid. © 2017 The Authors","Article","Final","Scopus"

For the sake of boosting resilience against faults, natural disasters, and unexpected traffic, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless communication systems can provide a unique opportunity to cater for such demands in a timely fashion without relying on the overly engineered cellular network. However, for UAV-assisted communication, issues of capacity, coverage, and energy efficiency are considered of paramount importance. The case of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is investigated for aerial base station (BS). NOMA's viability is established by formulating the sum-rate problem constituting a function of power allocation and UAV altitude. The optimization problem is constrained to meet individual user-rates arisen by orthogonal multiple access (OMA) bringing it at par with NOMA. The relationship between energy efficiency and altitude of a UAV inspires the solution to the aforementioned problem considering two cases, namely, altitude fixed NOMA and altitude optimized NOMA. The latter allows exploiting the extra degrees of freedom of UAV-BS mobility to enhance the spectral efficiency and the energy efficiency. Hence, it saves joules in the operational cost of the UAV. Finally, a constrained coverage expansion methodology, facilitated by NOMA user rate gain is also proposed. Results are presented for various environment settings to conclude NOMA manifesting better performance in terms of sum-rate, coverage, and energy efficiency. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Stimulation of intrinsic lung defenses via inhalation of synergistically acting Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists protects mice broadly against pneumonia, including otherwise-lethal viral infections, providing a potential opportunity to mitigate infectious threats. As intact lung epithelial TLR signaling is required for the inducible resistance and as these cells are the principal targets of many respiratory viruses, the capacity of lung epithelial cells to be therapeutically manipulated to function as autonomous antiviral effectors was investigated. Our work revealed that mouse and human lung epithelial cells could be stimulated to generate robust antiviral responses that both reduce viral burden and enhance survival of isolated cells and intact animals. The antiviral protection required concurrent induction of epithelial reactive oxygen species (ROS) from both mitochondrial and dual oxidase sources, although neither type I interferon enrichment nor type I interferon signaling was required for the inducible protection. Taken together, these findings establish the sufficiency of lung epithelial cells to generate therapeutically inducible antiviral responses, reveal novel antiviral roles for ROS, provide mechanistic insights into inducible resistance, and may provide an opportunity to protect patients from viral pneumonia during periods of peak vulnerability. IMPORTANCE Viruses are the most commonly identified causes of pneumonia and inflict unacceptable morbidity, despite currently available therapies. While lung epithelial cells are principal targets of respiratory viruses, they have also been recently shown to contribute importantly to therapeutically inducible antimicrobial responses. This work finds that lung cells can be stimulated to protect themselves against viral challenges, even in the absence of leukocytes, both reducing viral burden and improving survival. Further, it was found that the protection occurs via unexpected induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from spatially segregated sources without reliance on type I interferon signaling. Coordinated multisource ROS generation has not previously been described against viruses, nor has ROS generation been reported for epithelial cells against any pathogen. Thus, these findings extend the potential clinical applications for the strategy of inducible resistance to protect vulnerable people against viral infections and also provide new insights into the capacity of lung cells to protect against infections via novel ROS-dependent mechanisms. © 2018 Kirkpatrick et al.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Fast 3D modelling of fully or partially collapsed buildings using images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can considerably help USaR efforts, thus improving disaster response and increasing survival rates. The a-priori establishment of a proper workflow for fast and reliable image-based 3D modelling and the a priori determination of the parameters that have to be set in each step of the photogrammetric pipeline are critical aspects that ensure the readiness in an emergency response situation.

First, the transmitted LTE signal model is presented and relevant positioning and timing information that can be extracted from these signals are identified. Second, a software-defined receiver (SDR) that is capable of acquiring, tracking, and producing pseudoranges from LTE signals is designed. Third, a threshold-based approach for detecting the first peak of the channel impulse response is proposed in which the threshold adapts to the environmental noise level. This method is demonstrated to be robust against noise and interference in the environment. Fourth, an approach for estimating pseudoranges of multiple base stations by tracking only one base station is proposed. Fifth, a navigation framework based on an extended Kalman filter is proposed to produce the navigation solution using the pseudorange measurements obtained by the proposed SDR. Finally, the proposed SDR is evaluated experimentally on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a ground vehicle. The root mean squared-error (RMSE) between the GPS navigation solution and LTE signals from three base stations produced by the proposed SDR for the UAV is shown to be 8.15 m with a standard deviation of 2.83 m. The RMSE between the GPS navigation solution and LTE signals from six base stations in a severe multipath environment for the ground vehicle is shown to be 5.80 m with a standard deviation of 3.02 m. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The IoT technology is also envisioned to play an important role in improving the effectiveness of military operations in battlefields. The interconnection of combat equipment and other battlefield resources for coordinated automated decisions is referred to as the Internet of battlefield things (IoBT). IoBT networks are significantly different from traditional IoT networks due to battlefield specific challenges, such as the absence of communication infrastructure, heterogeneity of devices, and susceptibility to cyber-physical attacks. The combat efficiency and coordinated decision-making in war scenarios depends highly on real-Time data collection, which in turn relies on the connectivity of the network and information dissemination in the presence of adversaries. This paper aims to build the theoretical foundations of designing secure and reconfigurable IoBT networks. Leveraging the theories of stochastic geometry and mathematical epidemiology, we develop an integrated framework to quantify the information dissemination among heterogeneous network devices. Consequently, a tractable optimization problem is formulated that can assist commanders in cost effectively planning the network and reconfiguring it according to the changing mission requirements. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

If the decision to intervene is made too early, the intervention can become a disturbance to the driver and if the decision is made too late, the safety benefits of the system will be reduced. Hence, proper threat assessment is important to make a decision for intervention in a RECAS. In this study, a new threat assessment measure using a varying time headway has been proposed to develop a rear-end collision avoidance algorithm (RECAA) for heavy commercial road vehicles in heterogeneous traffic. The proposed varying time headway depends on the type of lead vehicle, host vehicle load conditions, road conditions and relative longitudinal speed. The developed RECAA was implemented in a hardware-in-loop experimental setup that is equipped with the vehicle dynamic simulation software, IPG/TruckMaker® and tested for vehicle following scenarios using different types of lead vehicles and host vehicle loading conditions. The results showed that the proposed varying time headway improved the RECAA by activating the host vehicle's brake system at different time instants based on the type of lead vehicle and thereby preventing the unintended early brake intervention of RECAS. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

In such frameworks each cloud data source is autonomous and exchanges data with another cloud using pair-wise communication for user queries by creating an on-the-fly data-exchange session. The frameworks provide a platform for sharing or exchanging health data residing in multiple clouds for the purpose of data analysis, decision making, and improving patients’ treatment. As healthcare data are extremely sensitive, security is vital when sharing such data in a collaborative framework. Since clouds may exchange sensitive patient health data over an insecure channel, the sensitive data might be accessed or intercepted by malicious users or intruders. In this circumstance, a central third-party security mechanism (e.g., Public Key Infrastructure) can not protect confidential data. Concerning pair-wise, on-the-fly data exchange, this paper presents a two-phase security protocol that uses pairing-based cryptography. Each cloud computes a secret session key dynamically by computing a pairing in an elliptic curve.

To this aim, they may exploit multiple on-board sensors (e.g., radars, LiDARs, positioning systems) and direct vehicle-to-vehicle communications to synchronize their manoeuvres. The main objective of this paper is to discuss the design choices and factors that determine the performance of a platooning application, when exploiting the emerging cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication technology and considering the scheduled mode, specified by 3GPP for communications over the sidelink assisted by the eNodeB. Since no resource management algorithm is currently mandated by 3GPP for this new challenging context, we focus on analyzing the feasibility and performance of the dynamic scheduling approach, with platoon members asking for radio resources on a per-packet basis. We consider two ways of implementing dynamic scheduling, currently unspecified by 3GPP: the sequential mode, that is somehow reminiscent of time division multiple access solutions based on IEEE 802.11p—till now the only investigated access technology for platooning—and the simultaneous mode with spatial frequency reuse enabled by the eNodeB. The evaluation conducted through system-level simulations provides helpful insights about the proposed configurations and C-V2X parameter settings that mainly affect the reliability and latency performance of data exchange in platoons, under different load settings. Achieved results show that the proposed simultaneous mode succeeds in reducing the latency in the update cycle in each vehicle’s controller, thus enabling future high-density platooning scenarios. © 2018 by the authors.

Firstly, the macroscopic mathematical model is established using the Greenshields function, analytic hierarchy process and Monte Carlo simulation, where the congestion level is divided into five levels according to the average vehicle speed. The roads with an obvious congestion situation is investigated mainly and the traffic flow and topology of the roads are analyzed firstly. By processing the data, I propose a traffic congestion model. In the model, I assume that half of the non-self-driving cars only take the shortest route and the other half can choose the path randomly. While self-driving cars can obtain vehicle density data of each road and choose the path more reasonable. When the path traffic density exceeds specific value, it cannot be selected. To overcome the dimensional differences of data, I rate the paths by BORDA sorting. The Monte Carlo simulation of Cellular Automaton is used to obtain the negative feedback information of the density of the traffic network, where the vehicles are added into the road network one by one. I then analyze the influence of negative feedback information on path selection of intelligent cars. The conclusion is that the increase of the proportion of intelligent vehicles will make the road load more balanced, and the self-driving cars can avoid the peak and reduce the degree of road congestion. Combined with other models, the optimal self-driving ratio is about sixty-two percent. From the microscopic aspect, by using the single-lane traffic NS rule, another model is established to analyze the road Partition scheme. The self-driving traffic is more intelligent, and their cooperation can reduce the random deceleration probability. By the model, I get the different self-driving ratio of space-time distribution. I also simulate the case of making a lane separately for self-driving, compared to the former model. It is concluded that a single lane is more efficient in a certain interval. However, it is not recommended to offer a lane separately. However, the self-driving also faces the problem of hacker attacks and greater damage after fault. So, when self-driving ratio is higher than a certain value, the increase of traffic flow rate is small. In this article, that value is discussed, and the optimal proportion is determined. Finally, I give a nontechnical explanation of the problem. © 2018 Author(s).","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, the capacity of backhaul is limited. In this paper, UAV assisted secure transmission for scalable videos in hyper-dense networks via caching is studied. In the proposed scheme, UAVs can act as SBSs to provide videos to mobile users in some small cells. To reduce the pressure of wireless backhaul, UAVs and SBSs are both equipped with caches to store videos at off-peak time. To facilitate UAVs, a single antenna is equipped at each UAV and thus, only the precoding matrices of SBSs should be cooperatively designed to manage interference by exploiting the principle of interference alignment. On the other hand, the SBSs replaced by UAVs will be idle. Thus, in order to guarantee secure transmission, the idle SBSs can be further exploited to generate jamming signal to disrupt eavesdropping. The jamming signal is zero-forced at the legitimate users through the precoding of the idle SBSs, without affecting the legitimate transmission. The feasibility conditions of the proposed scheme are derived, and the secrecy performance is analyzed.

Gesneria pauciflora is a threatened, rupiculous, and riverine species with floral-traits that suggest a hummingbird-pollination system. Because these habitat-pollinator conditions have been linked to pollinator-independent reproductive systems, we expected a breeding system that provides reproductive assurance. We assessed the breeding system and potential vulnerabilities during pollination phase using field observations and pollination experiments, to determine pollinator dependency and the existence of strategies for reproductive assurance. Gesneria pauciflora was pollinated by two hummingbird species but visitation rates were low, probably due to low nectar rewards. Fruit set and seed production were significantly higher in flowers when pollen was artificially delivered (self- and cross-pollination) compared to when it was not (control and autogamy), suggesting that reproduction is pollen-limited. Gesneria pauciflora is self-compatible, with some seeds produced via autonomous selfing without any effects of pollination mechanism on seed germination rates. Florivory by the native plume-moth Postplatyptilia caribica was observed, but its incidence was low (12%). Our findings are consistent with theory on the evolution of plant breeding systems on islands, and contribute to the understanding of the evolution of breeding systems in Caribbean gesneriads. Overall, data do not show immediate vulnerabilities to this listed species at the pollination phase, and autogamy may represent reproductive assurance counteracting unpredictable environmental factors that influence its reproduction. However, its capacity for selfing is small relative to other tubular Puerto Rican Gesneria which may explain its rare status. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Article","Final","Scopus"

As a first step, we have formulated such deployment along a line as a sequential decision problem. In our earlier work, reported in [1] , we proposed two possible deployment approaches: (i) the pure as-you-go approach where the deployment agent can only move forward, and (ii) the explore-forward approach where the deployment agent explores a few successive steps and then selects the best relay placement location among them. The latter was shown to provide better performance (in terms of network cost, network performance, and power expenditure), but at the expense of more measurements and deployment time, which makes explore-forward impractical for quick deployment by an energy constrained agent such as a UAV. Further, since in emergency situations the terrain would be unknown, the deployment algorithm should not require a-priori knowledge of the parameters of the wireless propagation model. In [1] , we, therefore, developed learning algorithms for the explore-forward approach. The current paper fills in an important gap by providing deploy-and-learn algorithms for the pure as-you-go approach. We formulate the sequential relay deployment problem as an average cost Markov decision process (MDP), which trades off among power consumption, link outage probabilities, and the number of relay nodes in the deployed network. While the pure as-you-go deployment problem was previously formulated as a discounted cost MDP (see [1] ), the discounted cost MDP formulation was not amenable for learning algorithms that are proposed in this paper. In this paper, first we show structural results for the optimal policy corresponding to the average cost MDP, and provide new insights into the optimal policy. Next, by exploiting the special structure of the average cost optimality equation and by using the theory of asynchronous stochastic approximation (in single and two timescale), we develop two learning algorithms that asymptotically converge to the set of optimal policies as deployment progresses. Numerical results show reasonably fast speed of convergence, and hence the model-free algorithms can be useful for practical, fast deployment of emergency wireless networks. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The objective of this work is to present a stand-Alone hill hold assist function to prevent the robotic vehicles from roll-backs while climbing a steep hill. The adaptive motion planning of the bots is illustrated using the scenario where the vehicle is standstill at the base of a hill.

The lack of remaining treatment options has resulted in the utilization of older drug classes, including colistin. As a drug of last resort, the discovery of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance by mcr-1 denotes the potential development of pandrug-resistant bacterial pathogens. To address the emergence of the mcr-1 gene, 118 gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae isolated from clinical samples collected at Queen Sirikit Naval Hospital in Chonburi, Thailand were screened for colistin resistance using automated antimicrobial susceptibility testing and conventional PCR screening. Two K. pneumoniae strains, QS17-0029 and QS17-0161, were positive for mcr-1, and both isolates were sequenced to closure using short- and long-read whole-genome sequencing. QS17-0029 carried 16 antibiotic resistance genes in addition to mcr-1, including 2 carbapenemases, blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-232. QS17-0161 carried 13 antibiotic resistance genes in addition to mcr-1, including the extended-spectrum β-lactamase blaCTX-M-55. Both isolates carried multiple plasmids, but mcr-1 was located alone on highly similar 33.9 Kb IncX4 plasmids in both isolates. The IncX4 plasmid shared considerable homology to other mcr-1-containing IncX4 plasmids.

Any malicious activity has the potential to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messages exchanged between different vehicles. To ensure secure message communication among the vehicles in a smart city environment, a novel scheme using elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC) technique has been presented in this paper. For this purpose, a two-level authentication key exchange scheme has been designed. In the first level authentication, CH s are verified by series of messages exchanged between CH s and the CA. The verifiedCHs are responsible for authentication of vehicles in the second level authentication, followed by exchange of messages between CH and vehicle. The security analysis using widely accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic, formal security analysis using random oracle model and verification using the widely known automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool, and also the informal security analysis have been done with respect to various types of attacks. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed scheme with existing related schemes reveals that it generates low overhead and latency, and high reliability during messages exchange between vehicles and the CA. © 2017 IEEE.","Review","Final","Scopus"

To limit the impact of outbreaks and to take efficient steps towards a timely control and eradication of the disease, rapid and reliable diagnostic systems are of utmost importance. Confirmatory diagnostic assays are typically performed by experienced operators in specialized laboratories, and access to this capability is often limited in the developing countries with the highest disease burden. Advances in molecular technologies allow implementation of modern and reliable techniques for quick and simple pathogen detection either in basic laboratories or even at the pen-side. Here, we report on a study to evaluate a fully automated cartridge-based real-time RT-PCR diagnostic system (Enigma MiniLab®) for the detection of FMD virus (FMDV). The modular system integrates both nucleic acid extraction and downstream real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). The analytical sensitivity of this assay was determined using serially diluted culture grown FMDV, and the performance of the assay was evaluated using a selected range of FMDV positive and negative clinical samples of bovine, porcine and ovine origin. The robustness of the assay was evaluated in an international inter-laboratory proficiency test and by deployment into an African laboratory. It was demonstrated that the system is easy to use and can detect FMDV with high sensitivity and specificity, roughly on par with standard laboratory methods. This cartridge-based automated real-time RT-PCR system for the detection of FMDV represents a reliable and easy to use diagnostic tool for the early and rapid disease detection of acutely infected animals even in remote areas. This type of system could be easily deployed for routine surveillance within endemic regions such as Africa or could alternatively be used in the developed world. © 2017 The Authors.

In order to improve the random access (RA) throughput of massive access machine-to-machine (M2M) communications over LTE networks, we propose a collision-aware resource access (CARA) scheme to reduce the collisions on the granted physical resource blocks (PRBs). In CARA, the evolved Node B exploits early collision detection of preambles at the first message and informs the MTCDs in the corresponding random access response (RAR) message if it can detect the collision successfully. The collided MTCDs then contend for PRBs access using an appropriate probability for efficient use of granted PRBs. Analytical and numerical performance evaluations of the CARA show that the RA throughput can be improved in comparison with the traditional RA procedure. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Such types of ad hoc networks are popularly known as flying ad hoc networks (FANETs). The FANET nodes have 2 prominent characteristics—collaboration and cooperation. Trust plays an important role in predicting the behavior of such nodes. Researchers have proposed various methods (direct and indirect) for calculation of the trust value of a given node in ad hoc networks, especially in mobile ad hoc networks and vehicular ad hoc networks. The major characteristic that differentiates a FANET from other ad hoc networks is the velocity of the node; as a result, there are frequent losses in connection and topology change. Therefore, the existing methods of trust calculation are not efficient and effective. In this paper, a fuzzy-based novel trust model has been proposed to handle the behavioral uncertainty of FANET nodes. Nodes are classified using a multicriteria fuzzy classification method based on node's behavior and performance in the fuzzy and complex environment. Quality of service and social parameter (recommendation) are considered for evaluating the trust value of each node to segregate the selfish and malicious nodes. With the node classification, FANET nodes are rewarded or punished to transform node behavior into a trust value. Compared with the existing trust techniques, the simulation results show that the proposed model has better adaptability, accuracy, and performance in FANETs.

This class approximates platforms endowed with noncollinear rotors that can modify the orientation of the total thrust in a body frame. If made possible by the force constraints, the proposed SE(3)-based control strategy achieves the independent tracking of position-plus-orientation trajectories. The method, which is proven using a Lyapunov technique, deals seamlessly with both underactuated and fully actuated platforms, and guarantees at least the position tracking in the case of an unfeasible full-pose reference trajectory.

Aiming at estimation for motion elements of multiple underwater targets, a Clustering Statistic Hough Transform (CSHT) method is proposed in order to overcome the false alarm and missing detection effects as well as positioning errors of the sonar data and improve the accuracy and reliability of feature extraction. First, the distance-direction data from the multi-beam forward-looking sonar mounted on the unmanned underwater vehicle are transformed to position curves of multiple targets in the earth-fixed frame, and the position curves appear to be sampling points that form the data space. Second, parameter space is constructed by applying Hough transform to the sampling points in the data space, and then the votes of each cell in the rasterized parameter space are accumulated. Finally, fuzzy iterative self organizing data analysis techniques algorithm clustering method is exploited for extraction of multiple peaks in the parameter space to realize estimation for motion elements. The application of CSHT method in the underwater multiple targets tracking system is further explained in this paper. Simulation results demonstrate that CSHT method is insensitive to environment noise, false alarm and missing detection effects of the sonar and offers favorable estimation accuracy and tracking performance, indicating engineering reliability. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas (MOBAs) - also known as Action Real-Time Strategy (ARTS) games - are video games in which each player controls a single character in one of two competing teams; goal of the game is to destroy the antagonist team. In both genres, players’ characters typically exploit their special abilities, which contribute to the overall strategy of their faction or team. Social interactions among players are at the core of both these game types, and a careful design of the game social architecture is a key factor in determining the success of a specific product. The attention of researchers and practitioners has, till now, focused mainly on several game features, while others have been considered secondary, possibly underestimating their importance in terms of the game overall quality. For instance, in MMOGs, loot items (a type of in-game reward) are not distributed evenly, and the competition for getting the best prize, often, is left in the hands of the players. To handle this issue, players have created resource allocation algorithms called Looting Systems (LS). Generally, the adoption of a specific LS is based on a gentlemen's agreement among the players, and the respect of its outcomes largely depends on mutual trust. Quite recently, ad hoc forms of LS have been introduced also into MOBAs. This topic has received moderate attention by the scientific community, anyway, we sustain that a LS could influence the players’ behaviour and, if mismanaged, possibly the survival of the whole community of players in a game. Hence, detecting and tracking the hidden social effects of apparently minor features could become a critical factor in the development of games genres which heavily depend on the quality of social interactions among players. To tackle this issue, we present a simulative study - based on Agent-Based Model (ABM) techniques - of the effects of the adoption of different LSs on heterogeneous player bases. The final goal of our study is to provide several guidelines and hints about the design of LSs to game designers working on MMOs or MOBAs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Novel attacks and changing laws lead to security issues that did not necessarily rise from a flawed initial design, but also when the system fails to keep up with a changing environment. Thus, security requires maintenance throughout the operation phase. Ongoing adaptations in response to changed security knowledge are inevitable. A necessary prerequisite for such adaptations is a good understanding of the security-relevant parts of the system and the security knowledge. We present a model-based framework for supporting the maintenance of security during the long-term evolution of a software system. It uses ontologies to manage the system-specific and the security knowledge. With model queries, graph transformation and differencing techniques, knowledge changes are analyzed and the system model is adapted. We introduce the novel concept of Security Maintenance Rules to couple the evolution of security knowledge with co-evolutions of the system model. As evaluation, community knowledge about vulnerabilities is used (Common Weakness Enumeration database). We show the applicability of the framework to the iTrust system from the medical care domain and hence show the benefits of supporting co-evolution for maintaining secure systems. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, communication with unmanned vehicles are subject to attack and compromise. Such attacks have been reported as early as 2009, when a Predator UAV's video stream was compromised. Since UAVs extensively utilize autonomous behavior, it is important to develop an autopilot system that is robust to potential cyber-attack. In this paper, we present a biometric system to encrypt communication between a UAV and a computerized base station. This is accomplished by generating a key derived from a user's EEG Beta component. We first extract coefficients from Beta data using Legendre's polynomials. We perform encoding of the coefficients using Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem encoding and then generate a key from a hash function. The key is used to encrypt the communication between XBees. Also we have introduced scenarios where the communication is attacked. When communication with a UAV is attacked, a safety mechanism directs the UAV to a safe home location.

The integration of energy storage gives dispatchability to the variable renewable generation while the combination of different generation technologies can reduce the costs. However, the design of reliable and cost competitive hybrid solar power plants requires the careful balancing of trade-offs between financial and technical performance. This is made more complicated by the dependence on a larger number of parameters compared to conventional plants and due to the integration of TES which requires that the operational profile is optimised for every design. This contribution presents a two-stage, multi-objective optimisation framework which combines multi-objective linear programming methods for the operational optimisation with multi-objective genetic algorithms for the design optimisation. The operational optimisation which is performed for every design point needs to be performed with linear programming methods. Here an automated scalarisation method is developed for the linear programming method which enables the multi-objective optimisation of the operational profile. This enables the evaluation of the trade-offs between financial and technical performance in both the design and operational optimisation, which is required to design reliable and cost competitive sustainable energy systems. The two-stage multi-objective optimisation is applied to analyse and improve the design of the hybrid solar power plant Atacama-1. It is demonstrated that balancing the trade-off between financial and technical performance is key to increase the competitiveness of solar energy and that it is possible to simultaneously increase dispatchability and decrease the levelised cost of energy. This shows that the operational and design optimisations have to be directly linked in order to exploit the synergies of hybrid systems. Thus the optimisation framework presented in this study can improve the decision making in the design of hybrid solar power plants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

The framework uses a Viola-Jones classifier trained to detect sewer inlets in aerial images with a ground sampling distance of 3-3.5 cm/pixel. The detections are then projected into three-dimensional space where they are clustered and reclassified to discard false positives. The method is evaluated by cross-validating results from an image cloud of 252 UAV images captured over a 0.57-km2 study area with 228 sewer inlets.

This is especially relevant to the cardiovascular system, for example the circadian mechanism orchestrates rhythms in heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac contractility, metabolism, gene and protein abundance over the 24-h day and night cycles. Conversely, disturbing circadian rhythms (e.g. via shift work, sleep disorders) increases cardiovascular disease risk, and exacerbates cardiac remodelling and worsens outcome. Notably, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important contributors to heart disease, especially the pathophysiologic damage that occurs after myocardial infarction (MI, heart attack). However, little is known about how the circadian mechanism, or rhythm desynchrony, is involved in these key pathologic stress responses. This review summarizes the current knowledge on circadian rhythms in the cardiovascular system, and the implications of rhythm disturbances for cardiovascular health. Furthermore, we highlight how free radical biology coincides with the pathogenesis of myocardial repair and remodelling after MI, and indicate a role for the circadian system in the oxidative stress pathways in the heart and brain after MI. This fusion of circadian biology with cardiac oxidative stress pathways is novel, and offers enormous potential for improving our understanding and treatment of heart disease. © 2017 The Authors","Review","Final","Scopus"

Samples are taken from mice fed with normal or fructose-enriched diets provided either in aqueous solution or in solid form and analyzed at three stages of the dietary intervention (1, 6, and 12 weeks). Automated Untargeted and Targeted fingerprinting for 2D data elaboration is adopted for the most inclusive data mining of GC×GC patterns. The UT fingerprinting strategy performs a fully automated peak-region features fingerprinting and combines results from pre-targeted compounds and unknowns across the sample-set. The most informative metabolites, with statistically relevant differences between sample groups, are obtained by unsupervised multivariate analysis (MVA) and cross-validated by multi-factor analysis (MFA) with external standard quantitation by GC-MS. Results indicate coherent clustering of mice urine signatures according to dietary manipulation.

For instance, a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is required to facilitate the local data exchange and therefore improve the automation level in automated driving applications. In this paper, we inspect the performance of two different air interfaces (i.e., LTE-Uu and PC5) which are proposed by the third generation partnership project to enable the V2X communication. With these two air interfaces, the V2X communication can be realized by transmitting data packets either over the network infrastructure or directly among traffic participants. In addition, the ultra-high reliability requirement in some V2X communication scenarios cannot be fulfilled with any single transmission technology (i.e., either LTE-Uu or PC5). Therefore, we discuss how to efficiently apply multi-radio access technologies (multi-RAT) to improve the communication reliability. In order to exploit the multi-RAT in an efficient manner, both the independent and the coordinated transmission schemes are designed and inspected. Subsequently, the conventional uplink is also extended to the case where a base station can receive data packets through both the LTE-Uu and PC5 interfaces. Moreover, different multicast-broadcast single-frequency network area mapping approaches are also proposed to improve the communication reliability in the LTE downlink. Last but not least, a system level simulator is implemented in this paper. The simulation results do not only provide us insights on the performances of different technologies but also validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-RAT scheme. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This attack can be detected by comparing the features extracted from the traffic happening to the heuristic and proper data set. The comparison done is not only by comparing the distribution of the data transferred but also looking at the correlation between each instrument. The correlation is needed since several instruments might work dependently while others might work independently. Data that are compared in the analysis are the features of each instrument from the traffic which are number of command transfer, number of handshake transfer, and the ratio of command transfer to the command transfer median from the samples.

Such attacks compromise the basic premise of hardware root of trust. Over the past decade, significant research efforts have been directed to carefully analyze the trust issues arising from hardware Trojans and to protect against them. This vast body of work often needs to rely on well-defined set of trust benchmarks that can reliably evaluate the effectiveness of the protection methods. In recent past, efforts have been made to develop a benchmark suite to analyze the effectiveness of pre-silicon Trojan detection and prevention methodologies. However, there are only a limited number of Trojan inserted benchmarks available. Moreover, there is an inherent bias as the researcher is aware of Trojan properties such as location and trigger condition since the current benchmarks are static. In order to create an unbiased and robust benchmark suite to evaluate the effectiveness of any protection technique, we have developed a comprehensive framework of automatic hardware Trojan insertion. Given a netlist, the framework will automatically generate a design with single or multiple Trojan instances based user-specified Trojan properties. It allows a wide variety of configurations, such as the type of Trojan, Trojan activation probability, number of triggers, and choice of payload. The tool ensures that the inserted Trojan is a valid one and allow for provisions to optimize the Trojan footprint (area and switching). Experiments demonstrate that a state-of-the-art Trojan detection technique provides poor efficacy when using benchmarks generated by our tool.

It employs both state and output feedback control techniques in designing a nonlinear ℋ∞ controller such that the autonomous underwater vehicle tracks the desired depth profile. The diving control problem is formulated as a disturbance attenuation problem, in view of achieving the desired performance by attenuating the internal as well as the external disturbances by ensuring internal stability and robustness. Two Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs inequalities have been formulated in the form of a Taylor series technique to determine solutions to the control algorithms. The solution of the first Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs inequality renders a state feedback control law whereas the second inequality is exploited to design a nonlinear observer for estimating the autonomous underwater vehicle states in order to realize an output feedback controller. These control algorithms are implemented firstly using the MATLAB/Simulink environment and then, the experimental validation of the developed control algorithm has been performed in order to ensure the effectiveness of the control scheme. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","Article","Final","Scopus"

For instance, a UAV can be used to embed a flying base station providing an on-demand nomadic access to network services. A UAV can also be used to wirelessly recharge out-of-battery ground devices. In this paper, we aim to deal with both data collection and recharging depleted ground Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices through a UAV station used as a flying base station. To extend the network lifetime, we present a novel use of UAV with energy harvesting module and wireless recharging capabilities. However, the UAV is used as an energy source to empower depleted IoT devices. On one hand, the UAV charges depleted ground IoT devices under three policies: (1) low-battery first scheme; (2) high-battery first scheme; and (3) random scheme. On the other hand, the UAV station collects data from IoT devices that have sufficient energy to transmit their packets, and in the same phase, the UAV exploits the Radio Frequency (RF) signals transmitted by IoT devices to extract and harvest energy. Furthermore, and as the UAV station has a limited coverage time due to its energy constraints, we propose and investigate an efficient trade-off between ground users recharging time and data gathering time. Furthermore, we suggest to control and optimize the UAV trajectory in order to complete its travel within a minimum time, while minimizing the energy spent and/or enhancing the network lifetime. Extensive numerical results and simulations show how the system behaves under different scenarios and using various metrics in which we examine the added value of UAV with energy harvesting module. © 2018 by the authors.

"Dynamic modeling of indole glucosinolate hydrolysis and its impact on auxin signaling","2018","Frontiers in Plant Science","10.3389/fpls.2018.00550","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046904219&doi=10.3389%2ffpls.2018.00550&partnerID=40&md5=4235b9d366f58dcd40635c2f3599ec30","Plants release chemicals to deter attackers. Arabidopsis thaliana relies on multiple defense compounds, including indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate (I3G), which upon hydrolysis initiated by myrosinase enzymes releases a multitude of bioactive compounds, among others, indole-3-acetonitrile and indole-3-acetoisothiocyanate. The highly unstable isothiocyanate rapidly reacts with other molecules. One of the products, indole-3-carbinol, was reported to inhibit auxin signaling through binding to the TIR1 auxin receptor. On the contrary, the nitrile product of I3G hydrolysis can be converted by nitrilase enzymes to form the primary auxin molecule, indole-3-acetic acid, which activates TIR1. This suggests that auxin signaling is subject to both antagonistic and protagonistic effects of I3G hydrolysis upon attack. We hypothesize that I3G hydrolysis and auxin signaling form an incoherent feedforward loop and we build a mathematical model to examine the regulatory network dynamics. We use molecular docking to investigate the possible antagonistic properties of different I3G hydrolysis products by competitive binding to the TIR1 receptor. Our simulations reveal an uncoupling of auxin concentration and signaling, and we determine that enzyme activity and antagonist binding affinity are key parameters for this uncoupling. The molecular docking predicts that several I3G hydrolysis products strongly antagonize auxin signaling. By comparing a tissue disrupting attack – e.g., by chewing insects or necrotrophic pathogens that causes rapid release of I3G hydrolysis products – to sustained cell-autonomous I3G hydrolysis, e.g., upon infection by biotrophic pathogens, we find that each scenario gives rise to distinct auxin signaling dynamics. This suggests that plants have different defense versus growth strategies depending on the nature of the attack. © 2018 Vik, Mitarai, Wulff, Halkier and Burow.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Such areas where m-health systems have been extensively deployed include monitoring of long-term health conditions such as cardio-vascular diseases and pulmonary disorders, as well as detection of changes from baseline measurements of such conditions. Asthma is one of the respiratory conditions with growing concern across the globe due to the economic, social and emotional burden associated with the ailment. The management and control of asthma can be improved by consistent monitoring of the condition in real-time since attack could occur anytime and anywhere. This paper proposes the use of smartphone equipped with built-in sensors, to capture and analyze early symptoms of asthma triggered by exercise. The system design is based on decision support system (DSS) techniques for measuring and analyzing the level and type of patient’s physical activity as well as weather conditions that predispose asthma attack. Preliminary results show that smartphones can be used to monitor and detect asthma symptoms without other networked devices. This would enhance the usability of the health system while ensuring user’s data privacy, and reducing the overall cost of system deployment. Further, the proposed system can serve as a handy tool for a quick medical response for asthmatics in low-income countries where there is limited access to specialized medical devices and shortages of health professionals.

One of the more common aircraft-relative wind instruments is the multihole probe (MHP). While the MHP is accurate and simple to use, two main drawbacks exist: 1) the MHP airdata system can cost several times that of the sUAS and 2) the probe itself is often exposed to damage during routine operations. Flush airdata systems (FADS) are an alternative approach and utilize pressure ports flush with the aircraft surface. This removes any external components, thereby mitigating the risk of damage to the airdata system. The work presented details the implementation of a FADS for sUAS. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were used to determine the port locations of the FADS. Airframe locations were sorted based on the total sensitivity over a range of angles of attack and sideslip. The FADS was calibrated in flight using an onboard MHP. Multilayer feedforward neural networks were employed to produce estimates of the angle of attack and sideslip, while static and stagnation ports on the fuselage measured airspeed. Results from flight testing show errors in angle of attack and sideslip were unbiased. Additionally, 97.9% of the errors in airspeed were within 1 m s-1 of the MHP, while 93.8% and 87.3% of the angle of attack and sideslip errors, respectively, were within 1°. Flight tests show that a FADS can be calibrated in flight and that it is an effective method for measuring the aircraft-relative wind from small UAS. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

While managing such events is dangerous, the release of hazardous materials, such as toxic chemicals, into the atmosphere is particularly challenging. Upon arrival at a scene, response teams must quickly identify the hazardous substance and the contaminated area to limit exposure to nearby population centers. For airborne toxins, this assessment is complicated by environmental conditions, such as changes in wind speed and direction that can cause hazardous, aerial plumes to move dynamically. Without a way to dynamically monitor and assess atmospheric conditions during these events, response teams must conservatively predict the extent of the contaminated area and then orchestrate evacuations and reroute traffic to ensure the safety of nearby populations. In this paper, we propose outfitting swarms of drones with Internet of Things (IoT) sensor platforms to enable dynamic tracking of hazardous aerial plumes. Augmenting drones with sensors enables emergency response teams to maintain safe distances during hazard identification, minimizing first response team exposure. Additionally, we integrate sensor-based particulate detection with autonomous drone flight control providing the capability to dynamically identify and track the boundaries of aerial plumes in real time. This enables first responders to visually identify plume movement and better predict and isolate the impact area.

The system exploits the capabilities of a high-performance CPU/GPU embedded system in order to provide on-board high-frequency pose estimation enabling autonomous takeoff and landing. The system is evaluated extensively with lab and field tests using a custom quadrotor. The autonomous landing is successfully demonstrated, through experimental tests, using the proposed algorithm. The results show that the system is able to provide precise pose estimation with a framerate of at least 30 fps and an image resolution of 640×480 pixels.

The model considers groundwater flow, transport of groundwater age and the influence of a fault on the flow system and its implications for groundwater quality. By including deep and shallow flow systems, the study helps fill a knowledge gap with respect to intermediate flow systems and the role they would play during potential energy resource development including shale gas exploitation from the Utica Shale. Physical and chemical hydrogeological data, including an analysis of 14C in dissolved inorganic carbon in sampled groundwater, supported a regional conceptual flow model forming the basis for numerical simulations. The numerical model is first calibrated to regional piezometry through a semi-automated workflow using the inverse model PEST. Although some evidence for deeper regional flow exists, the area appears to be dominated by local flow systems on maximum length scales of about 5 km, with significant flow through the top 40 to 60 m of the fractured sedimentary rock aquifer. This regional-scale flow model is also supported by the local hydrogeochemical signatures. Simulated mean groundwater ages show young shallow water of < 100 years with rapid increases in age with depth suggesting diffusion-controlled age evolution. Groundwater age is likely being perturbed in the vicinity of the Jacques Cartier River fault, which can act as both a barrier and a preferential pathway, provided permeability contrasts with the surrounding rock are at least two orders of magnitude. © 2018, © 2018 Canadian Water Resources Association.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Strategy performance is compared on two surveillance and pursuit tasks that require optimal control: the maximization of expected range while maintaining altitude within given limits, and the maximization of expected range while following a moving ground vehicle within a prescribed distance and maintaining altitude within given limits. Both tasks involve flight management decisions of glider airspeed and the time-to-spend climbing in a randomly encountered thermal. The first strategy is stochastic drift counteraction optimal control (SDCOC), a dynamic programming method that relies on a model. Here, SDCOC uses a computationally inexpensive yet accurate environment model that reflects transition probabilities between updrafts and downdrafts as well as thermal locations and strengths based on existing glider flight data. The second strategy is selective evolutionary generation, a model-free Markov chain Monte Carlo method that is not subject to the curse of dimensionality, efficiently searches for an optimal control in an online and tunable fashion, and easily adapts to a dynamic environment. However, this strategy requires a tolerance for learning and decision-space exploration. Both strategies perform satisfactorily, and showcase an environment/decision-space exploitation-exploration tradeoff. © 2017 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It was recently shown that for monotone bistable systems, this problem admits easy-to-implement open-loop solutions in terms of temporal pulses (i.e., step functions of fixed length and fixed magnitude). In this paper, we develop this idea further and formulate a problem of convergence to an equilibrium from an arbitrary initial point. We show that the convergence problem can be solved using a static optimization problem in the case of monotone systems. Changing the initial point to an arbitrary state allows building closed-loop, event-based or open-loop policies for the switching/convergence problems. In our derivations, we exploit the Koopman operator, which offers a linear infinite-dimensional representation of an autonomous nonlinear system and powerful computational tools for their analysis. Our solutions to the switching/convergence problems can serve as building blocks for other control problems and can potentially be applied to non-monotone systems.

The functionally important reticulated platelet fraction and reticulocytes could play a role. Objectives: We performed a prospective, multi-centre, observational analytical study comparing full blood count parameters and platelet production/turnover/activation markers in patients with asymptomatic versus recently symptomatic moderate (≥ 50–69%) or severe (≥ 70–99%) carotid stenosis. Patients/methods: Data from 34 asymptomatic patients were compared with 43 symptomatic patients in the ‘early phase’ (≤ 4 weeks) and 37 of these patients in the ‘late phase’ (≥ 3 months) after TIA/ischaemic stroke. Reticulated platelets were quantified by whole blood flow cytometry and reticulated platelets and red cell reticulocytes by ‘automated assays’ (Sysmex XE-2100™). Bilateral simultaneous transcranial Doppler ultrasound monitoring classified patients as micro-embolic signal (MES)+ve or MES−ve. Results: Mean platelet count was higher in early (216 × 109/L; P = 0.04) and late symptomatic (219 × 109/L; P = 0.044) than asymptomatic patients (194 × 109/L). Mean platelet volume was higher in early symptomatic than asymptomatic patients (10.8 vs. 10.45 fl; P = 0.045). Automated assays revealed higher % reticulated platelet fractions in early (5.78%; P < 0.001) and late symptomatic (5.11%; P = 0.01) than asymptomatic patients (3.48%). Red cell reticulocyte counts were lower in early (0.92%; P = 0.035) and late symptomatic (0.93%; P = 0.036) than asymptomatic patients (1.07%). The automated % reticulated platelet fraction was also higher in early symptomatic than asymptomatic MES−ve patients (5.7 vs. 3.55%; P = 0.001). Discussion: The combination of increased platelet counts and a shift towards production of an increased population of larger, young, reticulated platelets could contribute to a higher risk of first or recurrent cerebrovascular events in recently symptomatic versus asymptomatic carotid stenosis, including those who are MES−ve. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The key is to develop an algorithm to fuse the data from multiple radiological and 3D vision sensors as one system. The system under development at the University of Florida is being assessed with various types of radiological detectors and widely available visual sensors. A series of experiments were devised utilizing two EJ-309 liquid organic scintillation detectors (one primary and one secondary), a Microsoft Kinect for Windows v2 sensor and a Velodyne HDL-32E High Definition LiDAR Sensor which is a highly sensitive vision sensor primarily used to generate data for self-driving cars. Each experiment consisted of 27 static measurements of a source arranged in a cube with three different distances in each dimension. The source used was Cf-252. The calibration algorithm developed is utilized to calibrate the relative 3D-location of the two different types of sensors without need to measure it by hand; thus, preventing operator manipulation and human errors. The algorithm can also account for the facility dependent deviation from ideal data fusion correlation. Use of the vision sensor to determine the location of a sensor would also limit the possible locations and it does not allow for room dependence (facility dependent deviation) to generate a detector pseudo-location to be used for data analysis later. Using manually measured source location data, our algorithm-predicted the offset detector location within an average of 20 cm calibration-difference to its actual location. Calibration-difference is the Euclidean distance from the algorithm predicted detector location to the measured detector location. The Kinect vision sensor data produced an average calibration-difference of 35 cm and the HDL-32E produced an average calibration-difference of 22 cm. Using NaI and He-3 detectors in place of the EJ-309, the calibration-difference was 52 cm for NaI and 75 cm for He-3. The algorithm is not detector dependent; however, from these results it was determined that detector dependent adjustments are required. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This paper describes the results of a test flight campaign to demonstrate an autonomous soaring system that generates a dynamic map of lift sources (thermals) in the environment and uses this map for on-line flight planning and decision making. The aircraft is based on a commercially available radio-controlled glider; it is equipped with an autopilot module for low-level flight control and on-board computer that hosts all autonomy algorithms. Components of the autonomy algorithm include thermal mapping, explore/exploit decision making, navigation, optimal airspeed computation, thermal centering control, and energy state estimation. A finite state machine manages flight behaviors and switching between behaviors. Flight tests at Aberdeen Proving Ground resulted in 7.8 h flight time with the autonomous soaring system engaged, with three hours spent climbing in thermals. Postflight computation of energy state and frequent observations of groups of birds thermalling with our aircraft indicate that it was effectively exploiting available energy. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Traditionally, self-driving car uses Lidar, camera or fusion of the two kinds of sensors for sensing the environment. However, single Lidar or camera-based approaches will miss crucial information, and the fusion-based approaches often consume huge computing resources. We firstly propose a conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs)-based deep learning model that can rebuild rich semantic scene images from upsampled Lidar point clouds only. This makes it possible to remove cameras to reduce resource consumption and improve the processing rate. Simulation on the KITTI dataset also demonstrates that our model can reestablish color imagery from a single Lidar point cloud, and is effective enough for real time sensing on autonomous driving vehicles. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

A key element of these plans is NASA's Deep Space Gateway in cislunar space. Architectures for the Gateway should provide flexibility and resiliency to meet the objectives of multiple partners and demonstrate technologies for future missions. NASA's top priority objective for the Gateway is to serve as a waypoint for transits to the Mars vicinity and beyond. A second priority is technology and operation demonstrations, as identified in published NASA cislunar objectives, including the selection and testing of next generation spacecraft and life support systems. These demonstrations will support readiness for riskier long duration deep space transit missions. International partners have expressed interest in use of the Gateway as an outpost for crewed lunar sorties. For the multiple commercial and public/private partnerships that might have interest in use of the Gateway to supplement lunar surface exploration and exploitation; this unique platform could support communications, telerobotics, and even sample return. Boeing's cislunar proving ground architecture and operation concept address NASA's two fundamental goals, providing a lunar Gateway for Mars exploration and providing a testbed for technology and operations demonstrations, while also enabling possibilities for international and commercial partners. The Boeing architecture is based upon the heavy lift capability of the Space Launch System (SLS) and the associated capability to co-manifest a 10t element with Orion on a single launch to cislunar space, allowing relevant cargo to arrive with every cislunar crew. Key technology and operations demonstrations include deep space environment mitigations, deep space life support, electric propulsion, automated rendezvous & docking, operating with communications lag, and telerobotic operations. The Gateway is a flexible platform that can be positioned in optimal orbits for deep space proving ground objectives, lunar surface operations and Mars mission aggregation and departure point. This paper describes Boeing's Gateway architecture concept and analyzes how the architecture enables both exploration objectives and proving ground objectives. Using elements built with proven Boeing commercial and human spaceflight technologies, a flexible architecture is created to support known and future objectives based on open internal and external integration concepts. The concept relies heavily on standardization of interfaces such as data, power, docking, rendezvous, and communication. These standards allow for multiple commercial and international partners to develop and integrate their own exploration elements and technology demonstrations. The Boeing architecture is also focused on crew safety, including radiation exposure protection & contingency EVA capabilities. The Boeing architecture demonstrates that near term exploration objectives, such as lunar surface interactions, can be accomplished while demonstrating and preparing for full Mars mission capability. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

A leader and predecessor following (LPF) control architecture is known to allow string stable platooning with shorter safety gaps between vehicles as compared with predecessor following schemes. General LPF strategies, however, require the exact knowledge of spacing policies of predecessor vehicles for correctly specifying a spacing with respect to the leader. It follows that arbitrary spacing policies in ad hoc platoons prevent the applicability of classical LPF control structures. It is shown in this paper that it is possible to exploit the advantages of LPF architectures in multi-brand platoons without a priori knowledge of spacing policies of predecessors. The unknown spacing policies are replaced by a virtual one, which serves as an input to a two degree of freedom LPF controller. The resulting control structure enables the organization of ad hoc platoons consisting of vehicles with different spacing policies. Computer simulations are presented to illustrate the statements. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The UAS is expected to provide many promising applications such as intelligent transportation system, disaster management, search and rescue, public safety, smart delivery, wild species monitoring, and wireless service area extension. More specifically, as a part of the wireless service extension, we deal with the information dissemination and collection using a UAV in this paper. In this application, because the UAV communicates with each CH (Cluster Head) to collect data from sensor nodes or to disseminate information to the sensor nodes, well-behaved and qualified nodes should be elected as CHs and their integrity should be preserved. Even though a UAV makes the information dissemination and collection process efficient in a WSN, we can make the UAV help the election of new CHs to mitigate the threat of compromised CHs. To this aim, we first propose a UAV-aided CH election framework where a UAV delivers the critical information collected from sensors to the sink, and the sink reselects a set of well-behaved and qualified CHs considering the information. Then, we classify the existing security-driven CH election schemes into several categories and explain the principle of each category and its representative schemes. For each representative scheme, we also explain how to adapt it into the UAV-aided CH election framework. Next, we identify some desirable security properties that a CH election scheme should provide and reveal the security level that each representative scheme reaches for the desirable security properties. Next, we compare communication and computation overhead of the security-driven CH election schemes in terms of the big O notation.

In this paper, we introduce proactive anomaly detection to a use-case of hijacked connected cars to improve cyber-resilience. First, we manifest the opportunity of behavioral profiling for connected cars from recent literature covering related underpinning technologies. Then, we design and utilize a new data set file for connected cars influenced by the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast surveillance technology used in the aerospace industry to facilitate data collection and sharing. Finally, we simulate the analysis of travel routes in real time to predict anomalies using predictive modeling. Simulations show the applicability of a Bayesian estimation technique, namely, Kalman filter. With the analysis of future state predictions based on the previous behavior, cyber-threats can be addressed with a vastly increased time window for a reaction when encountering anomalies. We discuss that detecting real-time deviations for malicious intent with the predictive profiling and behavioral algorithms can be superior in effectiveness than the retrospective comparison of known-good/known-bad behavior. When quicker action can be taken while connected cars encounter cyberattacks, more effective engagement or interception of command and control will be achieved. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To achieve this goal, we propose a stereo visual-inertial odometry approach using a multistate constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF). In contrast with the conventional MSCKF, in which an inertial navigation system (INS) propagates the vehicle motion, and then the propagation is corrected by measurements of salient features extracted from images of a single camera, we update the propagation with observations extracted from images of a stereo pair of cameras. This way, additional constraints across the stereo pairs of images are exploited to improve the pose estimation. Experimental results on several KITTI datasets show that the stereo MSCKF outperforms the mono one achieving an average positioning error of 0.9% of the trajectory length compared to 1.3% for the mono approach and 2.5% for INS-only integration. These results show that visual-inertial odometry has a promising potential for vehicle positioning in short periods of GNSS signal outage. © 2016 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, the capacity of wireless backhaul is limited. In this paper, UAV assisted secure transmission for scalable videos in hyper-dense networks via caching is studied. In the proposed scheme, UAVs can replace SBSs to provide video streaming to mobile users in some small cells. To reduce the pressure of wireless backhaul, UAVs and SBSs are both equipped with caches to store scalable videos at off-peak time. To facilitate UAVs, a single antenna is equipped at each UAV, and thus, only the precoding matrices of SBSs should be cooperatively designed to manage interference. On the other hand, the SBSs replaced by UAVs will be idle. Thus, in order to guarantee the secure transmission, the idle SBSs can be further exploited to generate jamming signal to disrupt the eavesdropping, without affecting the legitimate transmission.

In this case, the customers (i.e., who are sharing the AV) and the AV all should come into the picture to verify each other. However, When a user requests for a ride share or rent, the responding AV/IoT device does not have the sufficient capability to store, process, or verify each other. In the existing security solutions, every AV/IoT device typically needs to rely on a trusted third party, which invokes another trust issue.

"Automated monitoring compared to standard care for the early detection of sepsis in critically ill patients","2018","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD012404.pub2","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049017507&doi=10.1002%2f14651858.CD012404.pub2&partnerID=40&md5=f3267f090eb9616a079168045dc4d1ee","Background: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that is usually diagnosed when a patient has a suspected or documented infection, and meets two or more criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The incidence of sepsis is higher among people admitted to critical care settings such as the intensive care unit (ICU) than among people in other settings. If left untreated sepsis can quickly worsen; severe sepsis has a mortality rate of 40% or higher, depending on definition. Recognition of sepsis can be challenging as it usually requires patient data to be combined from multiple unconnected sources, and interpreted correctly, which can be complex and time consuming to do. Electronic systems that are designed to connect information sources together, and automatically collate, analyse, and continuously monitor the information, as well as alerting healthcare staff when pre-determined diagnostic thresholds are met, may offer benefits by facilitating earlier recognition of sepsis and faster initiation of treatment, such as antimicrobial therapy, fluid resuscitation, inotropes, and vasopressors if appropriate. However, there is the possibility that electronic, automated systems do not offer benefits, or even cause harm. This might happen if the systems are unable to correctly detect sepsis (meaning that treatment is not started when it should be, or it is started when it shouldn't be), or healthcare staff may not respond to alerts quickly enough, or get 'alarm fatigue' especially if the alarms go off frequently or give too many false alarms. Objectives: To evaluate whether automated systems for the early detection of sepsis can reduce the time to appropriate treatment (such as initiation of antibiotics, fluids, inotropes, and vasopressors) and improve clinical outcomes in critically ill patients in the ICU. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; ISI Web of science; and LILACS, clinicaltrials.gov, and the World Health Organization trials portal. We searched all databases from their date of inception to 18 September 2017, with no restriction on country or language of publication. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared automated sepsis-monitoring systems to standard care (such as paper-based systems) in participants of any age admitted to intensive or critical care units for critical illness. We defined an automated system as any process capable of screening patient records or data (one or more systems) automatically at intervals for markers or characteristics that are indicative of sepsis. We defined critical illness as including, but not limited to postsurgery, trauma, stroke, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, burns, and hypovolaemic or haemorrhagic shock. We excluded non-randomized studies, quasi-randomized studies, and cross-over studies. We also excluded studies including people already diagnosed with sepsis. Data collection and analysis: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: time to initiation of antimicrobial therapy; time to initiation of fluid resuscitation; and 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included: length of stay in ICU; failed detection of sepsis; and quality of life. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome. Main results: We included three RCTs in this review. It was unclear if the RCTs were three separate studies involving 1199 participants in total, or if they were reports from the same study involving fewer participants. We decided to treat the studies separately, as we were unable to make contact with the study authors to clarify. All three RCTs are of very low study quality because of issues with unclear randomization methods, allocation concealment and uncertainty of effect size. Some of the studies were reported as abstracts only and contained limited data, which prevented meaningful analysis and assessment of potential biases. The studies included participants who all received automated electronic monitoring during their hospital stay. Participants were randomized to an intervention group (automated alerts sent from the system) or to usual care (no automated alerts sent from the system). Evidence from all three studies reported 'Time to initiation of antimicrobial therapy'. We were unable to pool the data, but the largest study involving 680 participants reported median time to initiation of antimicrobial therapy in the intervention group of 5.6 hours (interquartile range (IQR) 2.3 to 19.7) in the intervention group (n = not stated) and 7.8 hours (IQR 2.5 to 33.1) in the control group (n = not stated). No studies reported 'Time to initiation of fluid resuscitation' or the adverse event 'Mortality at 30 days'. However very low-quality evidence was available where mortality was reported at other time points. One study involving 77 participants reported 14-day mortality of 20% in the intervention group and 21% in the control group (numerator and denominator not stated). One study involving 442 participants reported mortality at 28 days, or discharge was 14% in the intervention group and 10% in the control group (numerator and denominator not reported). Sample sizes were not reported adequately for these outcomes and so we could not estimate confidence intervals. Very low-quality evidence from one study involving 442 participants reported 'Length of stay in ICU'. Median length of stay was 3.0 days in the intervention group (IQR = 2.0 to 5.0), and 3.0 days (IQR 2.0 to 4.0 in the control). Very low-quality evidence from one study involving at least 442 participants reported the adverse effect 'Failed detection of sepsis'. Data were only reported for failed detection of sepsis in two participants and it wasn't clear which group(s) this outcome occurred in. No studies reported 'Quality of life'. Authors' conclusions: It is unclear what effect automated systems for monitoring sepsis have on any of the outcomes included in this review. Very low-quality evidence is only available on automated alerts, which is only one component of automated monitoring systems. It is uncertain whether such systems can replace regular, careful review of the patient's condition by experienced healthcare staff. © 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.","Review","Final","Scopus"

The TIME study aims to determine if morning or evening dosing of antihypertensive medications is more effective in preventing heart attacks and strokes. The cardiovascular end points in TIME are identified by individual-level linkage to routinely collected hospital admissions and mortality data; these data are supplemented with participant-completed follow-up questionnaires, administered online. This substudy will provide information regarding the relative acceptability of morning and evening dosing of antihypertensives that will be essential should the TIME study results prompt doctors to consider advising particular dosing times to their patients. Methods and analysis TIME participants are aged over 18 years and prescribed at least one antihypertensive drug, taken once a day. They are self-enrolled and consented on the secure TIME website (www.timestudy.co.UK) and then randomised to dosing time. Study follow-up is conducted by automated email. Average participant follow-up is expected to be 4 years. Participants in the sleep substudy are asked to complete an online sleep quality questionnaire at baseline, after 3 months and annually. This includes a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and an Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The primary outcome of the TIME Sleep substudy is sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. Secondary outcomes include sleep quantity and duration, and an analysis of any association between sleep quality and the main outcome measures of the TIME study (heart attack, stroke and vascular death). © 2018 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article).

At the preliminary design stage, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of its maneuverability. The calculation of the hydrodynamic derivatives accurately is the key. At present, the most popular method to calculate the hydrodynamic derivatives is ship model experiment. But it needs complex equipment and costs lots of money and time. Adopting numerical simulation method to calculate the hydrodynamic derivatives can overcome these disadvantages. In this paper, the numerical simulation of the autonomous and remotely-operated vehicle (ARV) at different drift and attack angles is carried out by using in-house solver named naoe-FOAM-SJTU[1] based on SST-DES method, which is developed from OpenFOAM, to predict the hydrodynamic derivatives. The hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the ARV can be obtained through numerical calculation. By regression, the hydrodynamic derivatives are attained, which form the basis for motion simulation according to submarine 6-DOF motion model. Results show that the hydrodynamic derivatives of ARV can be calculated by numerical simulation method efficiently, which can be used to predict the maneuverability of underwater vehicle and guide us to design ARV. © 2018, Editorial Office of Journal of Hydrodynamics.

As the cost of UAVs is decreasing with novel technologies, their popularity is increasing rapidly in surveillance, disaster management, agriculture, military operations, etc. The recent trend of collaborative operations of a network of UAVs to achieve a common objective has attracted the researchers as well as commercial vendors. It has revolutionized the means of data collection to maximize mission performances. However, the collaborative UAVs, with respect to the mission objective, need to be resilient to the unavailability of one or more UAVs that can be caused due to cyberattacks or technical failures. As UAVs can easily be targeted by adversaries, these devices need to maintain safe communication with each other while avoiding fuel outage and mid-air collisions, thus reducing the possibilities of being hacked but remain undetected. In this work, we present a formal framework that takes different UAV parameters in a UAV network, resiliency requirements, and resource constraints as the input, and verifies for the resiliency threats. Each threat specifies if k or less number of UAVs fail, whether the rest of the network still can maintain successful communication. We illustrate the execution of this framework with an example case study. We evaluate the proposed framework to demonstrate the relationships between different parameters of a network and its resiliency. We also evaluate the framework in terms of the resiliency analysis performance and scalability. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Development of a geothermal reservoir usually requires a system of wells, pipelines and pumping equipment and control of such a system is quite complicated. In this regard, use of unmanned aerial vehicle is relevant. Two test unmanned aerial vehicle based infrared surveys have been conducted at the Khankala field (Chechen Republic) with the Khankala geothermal plant operating at different regimes: during the first survey – with, and the second – without reinjection of used geothermal fluid. Unmanned aerial vehicle Geoscan 201 equipped with digital (Sony DSX-RX1) and thermal imaging (Thermoframe-MX-TTX) cameras was used. Besides different images of the geothermal plant obtained by the surveys, 13 thermal anomalies have been identified. Analysis of the shape and temperature facilitated determination of their different sources: fire, heating systems, etc., which was confirmed by a ground reconnaissance.

To solve this problem, a feature fusion algorithm based on the combination of the bottom visual features and high-level visual features was proposed to classify the UAV target objects. The algorithm first extracted the underlying visual features and high-level visual features of the target object by using visual feature descriptors and Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE). Then, the principal component analysis (PAC) method was used to reduce the dimensionality of the global features. Finally, the global feature response was sent to the softmax regression model to complete the recognition and classification of the target object of the UAV.

However, at high altitudes, acquiring the channel state information (CSI) for HAPs, which is a key requirement to perform beamforming, is challenging. In this paper, by exploiting an interference alignment (IA) technique, a novel method for achieving the maximum sum-rate in HAP-based communications without CSI is proposed. In particular, to realize IA, a multiple-antenna tethered balloon is used as a relay between multiple HAP drones and ground stations (GSs). Here, a multiple-input multiple-output X network system is considered. The capacity of the considered M × N X network with a tethered balloon relay is derived in closed-form. Simulation results corroborate the theoretical findings and show that the proposed approach yields the maximum sum-rate in multiple HAPs-GSs communications in absence of CSI. The results also show the existence of an optimal balloon's altitude for which the sum-rate is maximized. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The studies are based on simulations with 3GPP-specified radio channel models including path loss, shadowing and fast fading effects. The considered positioning approach exploits measurement of Time-Of-Arrival (TOA) and Angle-Of-Departure (AOD), which are estimated from beamformed NR synchronization signals. Based on the given measurements and the assumed train movement model, the train position is tracked by using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is able to handle the non-linear relationship between the TOA and AOD measurements, and the estimated train position parameters. It is shown that in the considered scenario the TOA measurements are able to achieve better accuracy compared to the AOD measurements. However, as shown by the results, the best tracking performance is achieved, when both of the measurements are considered. In this case, a very high, sub-meter, tracking accuracy can be achieved for most (>75%) of the tracking time, thus achieving the positioning accuracy requirements envisioned for the 5G NR.

However, neither the overuse of hash function, or additional symmetric encryption, can truly increase the overall security. Instead, extra computation cost degraded the performance.

Even worse, user's identity can be parsed in insecure environment, even became traceable. Aiming to protect identity, a lightweight mutual authentication scheme is proposed. Redundant operations are removed, which make the verification process more explicit. It gains better performance with average cost compared to other similar schemes.

Against this backdrop, we present the case of an autonomous grassroots-monitoring network that took the initiative to protect their forest, in a context, where no external incentives and rule enforcement power were provided. The aim was to analyze the socio-demographic and economic backgrounds, motivations and achievements of forest monitors, compared to non-monitors in the same communities. A total of 137 interviews were conducted in four villages bordering Prey Lang forest in Cambodia. We used binary logit models to identify the factors that influenced the likelihood of being a monitor. Results show that there were few (22%, n = 30) active monitors. Active monitors were intrinsically motivated forest-users, and not specifically associated with a particular gender, ethnicity, or residence-time in that area. The most common interventions were with illegal loggers, and the monitors had a general feeling of success in stopping the illegal activities. Most (73%, n = 22) of them had been threatened by higher authorities and loggers. Our results show that despite the lack of power to enforce rules, absence of external funding and land-ownership rights, and enduring threats of violence and conflicts, autonomous community monitoring may take place when community members are sufficiently motivated by the risk of losing their resources. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

An Autonomous Drift Control (ADC) system based on a hierarchical control architecture is proposed to achieve this task. Specifically, the ADC consists of a high level layer that generates the state references and feedforward inputs to follow a reference path at a given body slip angle, and a low level Model Predictive Controller that coordinates the action of an Active Front Steering (AFS) system and four individual electric motors to track the upper level drift references. The performance of the proposed system is assessed in a Multi-Actuated Ground Vehicle (MAGV) using the simulation software IPG-CarMaker.

To achieve autonomous line patrolling, magnetic sensors can be placed on the UAV and magnetic field data can be used to determine the relative position between UAV and transmission lines. To realize real-time patrolling, the speed of calculation and line position recognition is expected to be fast, so machine learning algorithm is considered as a good option.

In order to realize free, time-optimal motion of autonomous vehicles through such complex environments, this paper presents a novel motion planning approach. The approach combines a global path planner with a local trajectory generator. The global planner finds a path through the complete environment, taking only the stationary obstacles into account. The local trajectory generator computes a detailed trajectory in a local frame around the global path, accounting for both stationary and moving obstacles. This trajectory is parameterized as a spline, and is obtained by solving an optimal control problem. In order to always include the latest information about the environment, the optimal control problem is solved online with a receding horizon. The paper demonstrates the potential of the proposed method with extensive numerical simulations. In addition, it presents an experimental validation in which a KUKA youBot moves through an obstructed environment.

However, these handover AKA protocols are vulnerable to malicious security attacks, suffer from privacy preservation, key escrow problem and key forward/ backward secrecy (KFS/ KBS). Moreover, these protocols exhibit high overhead and bandwidth consumption during the authentication process. To avoid these problems, we propose an efficient handover AKA protocol by using the double trap-door chameleon hash function in the wireless network. The proposed protocol takes the advantage of trap-door hash key holder to allows the network access. Hence, the proposed handover AKA protocol accommodates all the security features and provides the robust security. Moreover, the protocol avoids the key escrow problem, preserves the privacy of the communication entities and maintains the KFS/KBS. In addition, the formal simulation and security analysis of the proposed protocol are carried out using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The security analysis shows that the protocol is free from various known attacks. Furthermore, the performance analysis of the protocol is carried out in terms of communication and computation overhead.

Methods: Three hundred and one patients with type 2 diabetes underwent retinal photography with Remidio 'Fundus on phone' (FOP), a smartphone-based device, at a tertiary care diabetes centre in India. Grading of DR was performed by the ophthalmologists using International Clinical DR (ICDR) classification scale. STDR was defined by the presence of severe non-proliferative DR, proliferative DR or diabetic macular oedema (DME). The retinal photographs were graded using a validated AI DR screening software (EyeArt™) designed to identify DR, referable DR (moderate non-proliferative DR or worse and/or DME) or STDR. The sensitivity and specificity of automated grading were assessed and validated against the ophthalmologists' grading. Results: Retinal images of 296 patients were graded. DR was detected by the ophthalmologists in 191 (64.5%) and by the AI software in 203 (68.6%) patients while STDR was detected in 112 (37.8%) and 146 (49.3%) patients, respectively. The AI software showed 95.8% (95% CI 92.9-98.7) sensitivity and 80.2% (95% CI 72.6-87.8) specificity for detecting any DR and 99.1% (95% CI 95.1-99.9) sensitivity and 80.4% (95% CI 73.9-85.9) specificity in detecting STDR with a kappa agreement of k = 0.78 (p < 0.001) and k = 0.75 (p < 0.001), respectively.

The number of applications is increasing: from search and rescue, security, surveillance to science and research and unmanned cargo systems. A limiting factor for drone exploitation is that for the energy storage, normally, a battery is used and this solution affects flight time. A possible solution could be the utilization of fuel cells. This paper focuses on the utilization of fuel cells power as an alternative solution for drone propulsion. The aim of the study is to determine when it is more appropriate, in terms of mass, to use a battery or a hybrid (fuel cell + battery) system to power drones. To compare the different systems, a numerical simulation model has been developed in order to choose the best power system once the drone operation profile has been defined. The model allows comparing different type of fuels and battery systems. The data to tune the model have been taken from commercial products, today already available. The simulation model considers a light-weight open-air cathode PEM (Polymer Exchange Membrane) fuel cell. The stack power output is chosen according to the mission profile and rages from 200 W to 1000 W. The presented results show that, for the considered drone segment, multirotor drones with weight of 7 kg at take-off, lithium batteries are still the best choice for time flight shorter than about 1 h. A hybrid system, appears to be interesting for longer flights. For example, it has been calculated that a hybrid quadcopter drone with a mass of 7 kg, considering a flight profile that requires 1089 Wh can be powered with a 4.4 kg hybrid system composed by a 500 W and 1.4 kg PEM fuel cell system, 1.9 kg hydrogen composite pressure vessel and a 0.8 kg lithium battery. The same amount of energy can be stored in a lithium battery with a weight of about 6.6 kg. These means a weight saving of more than 30%. The hybrid system, in term of weight, is even more convenient for flight profiles that require more energy. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Article","Final","Scopus"

The chance of survival from this emergency increases if the victims receive early basic life support (BLS) including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and, if available, defibrillation using automated external defibrillator (AED). This emergency occurs mostly out-of-hospital. Consequently, lay rescuers are the first to react before medical personnel arrives. BLS training is one of the keys providing readiness for bystanders which lead to improving cardiac arrest outcome. Use of feedback devices during BLS training has been shown to improve the performance of learners. Despite the fact that there is a large number of applications in the market aiming to support BLS training, surprisingly, none of them is designed specifically to illustrate data from feedback devices and follow the standard guidelines. This paper discusses the development of a performance visualization model for BLS training with the use of sensor-embedded CPR manikin and AED trainer.

Particularly with the proliferation of unmanned systems, lightweight passive sensors could allow the remote detection of supercooled liquid. A three-dimensional radiative transfer model is utilized to determine the feasibility of a forward-viewing passive sensor for remotely detecting hazardous icing conditions. An analysis of simulated passive microwave spectra for a forward-viewing passive sensor finds dependencies on the liquid water content, cloud distance, and temperature, and sensitivity is noted across the millimeter-wave spectrum. Spectral flattening in the shoulders of molecular resonances corresponds to the presence of clouds, while saturated brightness temperatures near the transition lines are linked to the ambient temperature. A principal component analysis shows significant information content at G -band near the water vapor molecular transition, suggesting compact radiometer systems to detect and range supercooled liquid are feasible. Additional information content may be available at K -a-band, suggesting such observations would be useful when size and mass are not constrained. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Resource constrained mobile phones are designed to provide position, velocity and time to the end user even in the most challenging environments, where the GNSS signal is hardly available in the first place. This approach pursues usability and energy efficiency rather than security, thus leaving the smartphones exposed to potential vulnerabilities. Spoofing attacks are becoming a serious threat to applications that rely on GNSS: building a GNSS spoofer barely requires some basic knowledge and a few hundred euros. Differently from autonomous GNSS receivers, mobile devices have access to redundant positioning information (Assisted GNSS (A-GNSS), sensors, etc.) that can be useful for security purposes. The aim of this paper is to point out some simple expedients and cross checks that do not require modifications to the devices hardware, allowing to enhance security at a minimum cost, increasing their resilience to spoofing attacks. To this purpose, we first assess whether currently available smartphones already employ these checks for security purposes. We exploit our GNSS signal generator to carry out a systematic test campaign on several devices from different brands. In the test results the inconsistency between the GNSS signal and other information sources was never reported to the user. Indeed, the result of a spoofing attack was often the computation of fake PVT coordinates, or in the best case, a denial of service with unknown cause. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Wireless-enabled vehicles along with infrastructure units on the road are connected with traffic management centers that use intelligent data analysis tools to efficiently manage city's traffic. However, such wireless connectivity can make the ITS networks vulnerable to security threats; thus, impacting the application's reliability. On the other hand, the use of robust security techniques could hamper applications' quality of service (QoS). To understand the interplay between these two conflicting requirements, this article reviews the security and QoS design challenges in the ITS aspect of smart cities. Using an experimental test-bed, we evaluate the standard compliant security processing delays, develop an on-line tool that presents detailed security benchmark results, and study the impact of security on QoS using simulation results. We also discuss how machine learning based adaptive signature verification techniques can enhance QoS in ITS.

The Vehicular ad hoc Networks and the de facto vehicular networking standard IEEE 802.11p communication protocol are key tools for the deployment of platooning applications, since the cooperation among vehicles is based on a reliable communication structure. However, vehicular networks can suffer different security threats. Indeed, in collaborative driving applications, the sudden appearance of a malicious attack can mainly compromise: (i) the correctness of data traffic flow on the vehicular network by sending malicious messages that alter the platoon formation and its coordinated motion; (ii) the safety of platooning application by altering vehicular network communication capability. In view of the fact that cyber attacks can lead to dangerous implications for the security of autonomous driving systems, it is fundamental to consider their effects on the behavior of the interconnected vehicles, and to try to limit them from the control design stage. To this aim, in this work we focus on some relevant types of malicious threats that affect the platoon safety, i.e. application layer attacks (Spoofing and Message Falsification) and network layer attacks (Denial of Service and Burst Transmission), and we propose a novel collaborative control strategy for enhancing the protection level of autonomous platoons. The control protocol is designed and validated in both analytically and experimental way, for the appraised malicious attack scenarios and for different communication topology structures. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is shown by using PLEXE, a state of the art inter-vehicular communications and mobility simulator that includes basic building blocks for platooning. A detailed experimental analysis discloses the robustness of the proposed approach and its capabilities in reacting to the malicious attack effects. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Since manual test data generation is quite inefficient and even impractical, automated test data generation has been realized to produce an appropriate subset of input data to carry out effective software testing in reasonable times. This paper presents a memetic ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm for structural test data generation. The proposed approach incorporates (1+1)-evolution strategies (ES) to improve the search functionality of ants in local moves and enhance search exploitation. Moreover, we have introduced a novel definition of the pheromone functionality in the way that it discourages ants from choosing mostly covered paths of the program to reinforce search exploration. Given that branch coverage is considered as the coverage criterion, two fitness functions are used accordingly for our proposed algorithm. The first fitness function is a Boolean function which is particularly defined to maximize branch coverage. It outputs one if a given solution is successful in traversing at least a yet uncovered branch; otherwise, it returns zero. The second fitness function is formulated according to the complexity of branches covered. The value of the second fitness function is not taken into account for solutions whose Boolean function value equals one. For these solutions, the decision-making process of ants is merely carried out based on the first fitness function. The experimental results indicate the superiority of our memetic ACO algorithm relative to existing test data generation techniques in terms of both branch coverage and convergence speed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, any adversarial node with the 3D movement capability poses a significant threat to these networks as the adversary can position itself to attack the crucial links. An adaptive beamnulling antenna is used to spatially filter out signal coming from a certain direction that can maintain the links active without requiring additional spectrum. However, determining the beamnull region is very challenging for jammer with mobility. This paper presents a distributed mechanism where nodes measure the jammer's direction in a discrete interval and determine the optimal beamnull for the next interval. Kalman filter based tracking mechanism is used to estimate the most likely trajectory of the jammer from noisy observation of the jammer's position. A beam null border is determined by calculating confidence region of jammer's current and next position estimates. An optimization goal is presented to determine the optimal beam null that minimizes the number of deactivated links while maximizing the higher value of confidence for keeping the jammer inside the null. The framework works in the physical layer and can work with any upper layer protocol. The survivability of a 3D mesh network with a mobile jammer is studied through simulation that validates an 96.65% reduction in the number of jammed nodes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

A common critique aims at the limited validation of the tests as well as the risk of psycho-social stress or adaption of incorrect behavior by users triggered by misleading health information. Here, we examine in detail the specific role of advertising communication of DTC GT companies from a medical ethical perspective. Our argumentative analysis departs from the starting point that DTC GT operates at the intersection of two different contexts: medicine on the one hand and the market on the other. Both fields differ strongly with regard to their standards of communication practices and the underlying normative assumptions regarding autonomy and responsibility. Methods: Following a short review of the ethical contexts of medical and commercial communication, we provide case examples for persuasive messages of DTC GT websites and briefly analyze their design with a multi-modal approach to illustrate some of their problematic implications. Results: We observe three main aspects in DTC GT advertising communication: (1) the use of material suggesting medical professional legitimacy as a trust-establishing tool, (2) the suggestion of empowerment as a benefit of using DTC GT services and (3) the narrative of responsibility as a persuasive appeal to a moral self-conception. Conclusions: While strengthening and respecting the autonomy of a patient is the focus in medical communication, specifically genetic counselling, persuasive communication is the normal mode in marketing of consumer goods, presuming an autonomous, rational, independent consumer. This creates tension in the context of DTC GT regarding the expectation and normative assessment of communication strategies. Our analysis can even the ground for a better understanding of ethical problems associated with intersections of medical and commercial communication and point to perspectives of analysis of DTC GT advertising. © 2018 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

LSS can serve as strategic outpost to support a variety of manned and unmanned mission, or may carry scientific payloads for astronomical observations. The paper focuses on analysing LSS in the Earth-Moon system, exploring dynamical structures that are available within a multi-body gravitational environment. Coupling between attitude and orbital dynamics is investigated, with particular interest on the gravity gradient torque exerted by the two massive attractors. First, natural periodic orbit-attitude solutions are obtained; a LSS that exploits such solutions would benefit of a naturally periodic body rotation synchronous with the orbital motion, easing the effort of the attitude control system to satisfy pointing requirements. Then, the solar radiation pressure is introduced into the fully coupled dynamical model and its effects investigated, discovering novel periodic attitude solutions. Benefits of periodic behaviours that incorporate solar radiation pressure are discussed, and analysed via the variation of some parameters (e.g reflection/absorption coefficients, position of the centre of pressure). As a final step to refine the current perturbed orbit-attitude model, a structure flexibility is also superimposed to a reference orbit-attitude rigid body motion via a simple, yet effective model. The coupling of structural vibrations and attitude motion is preliminarily explored, and allows identification of possible challenges, that may be faced to position a LSS in a periodic orbit within the Earth-Moon system. © 2018 IAA","Article","Final","Scopus"

Different sensing architectures are presented in terms of filtering schemes, with the focus set on measurement equations and the relevant covariance matrices. The concept of generalized dilution of precision is introduced as a way to predict the son positioning accuracy resulting from available GNSS observables and cooperative measurements, and can thus be used to individuate optimal formation geometries and navigation performance bounds. Both numerical simulations in different scenarios, and first results from experimental datasets, demonstrate a good consistency with the achieved navigation accuracy.

In addition, the DLR is working on the integration of drones into unsegregated airspace in several national and international projects. One of the key elements for a safe integration of drones is the positioning capability of the air vehicle. On the one hand it is required for geofencing applications in order to create no-fly zones and on the other hand it is required to generate an airspace management for unmanned traffic. In recent years, the Performance Based Navigation (PBN) concept was introduced for manned aviation to exploit the navigation performance of modern satellite navigation and to manage the available airspace. One approach for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) is obviously to transfer the PBN concept for drone applications. However, as drones usually use commercial off the shelf equipment that is usually not certified for aviation applications, the question is how the basic principle can be transferred. In this work, we used a commercial octocopter (MikroKopter MK Okto XL 6S12 ARF) to assess the horizontal Navigation System Error (NSE) as well as the lateral Total System Error (TSE) while using different GNSS receivers. The horizontal navigation is based on GNSS in stand-alone mode or using SBAS augmentation and a compass for directional information aid.

Furthermore, directionalization via MIMO-based beamforming can boost the transmission range by utilizing Channel State Information (CSI). However, the high mobility and flight conditions of drones can threaten the ability to receive accurate CSI in time to achieve such gains. In this work, we design a UAV-based software defined radio (SDR) platform and perform a measurement study to characterize the air-to-ground channel between the aerial platforms and a terrestrial user in practical scenarios such as hovering, encircling, and linear topologies. Our experiments cover multiple carrier frequencies, including cellular (900MHz and 1800MHz) and WiFi (5GHz) bands. Furthermore, we address three baseline issues for deploying drone-based beamforming systems: channel reciprocity, feedback overhead, and update rate for channel estimation. Numerical results show that explicit CSI feedback can increase throughput by 123.9% over implicit feedback and the optimal update rate are similar across frequencies, underscoring the importance of drone-based beamfoming design. We additionally analyze the reciprocity error and find that the amplitude error remained steady while the phase error depends on mobility.

Existing hospitals, care centers, and other institutions currently provide care for many physically disabled and elderly patients. For these patients to go outside in the fresh air, they must necessarily leave their designated care areas, but this poses a risk of falls and other accidents, which can be particularly challenging to prevent or respond to the given staffing limitations. Such incidents can cause further physical and mental deterioration. Many studies have sought to minimize rescue response times by first establishing the incident location before alerting staff to respond. However, this approach does not guarantee minimized response times. This paper proposes an approach to allow medical staff to quickly arrive at the scene of an accident with patients and staff using mobile devices to automatically alert a central server of their current locations. In response to an accident notification, the server immediately alerts medical staff in closest proximity to the incident to respond, with the staff devices providing clear directions to reach the patient in distress, thus minimizing response times.

Therefore, the anti-collision function is vital to the UAV during flight. In order to ensure that the UAV can fly more stably, safely and can timely response, this paper proposed a set of four-axis aircraft which includes Arduino micro-controller, rotary anti-collision ultrasonic and the mobile WIFI control system.

The interest of wide-angles images for 3D modelling is confirmed by the introduction of fisheye models in several commercial software packages. The paper exploits the different mathematical models implemented in the most famous commercial photogrammetric software packages, highlighting the different processing pipelines and analysing the achievable results in terms of checkpoint residuals, as well as the quality of the delivered 3D point clouds. A two-step approach based on the creation of undistorted images has been tested too. An experimental test has been carried out using a Parrot Bebop 2 UAS by performing a flight over an historical complex located near Piacenza (Northern Italy), which is characterized by the simultaneous presence of horizontal, vertical and oblique surfaces. Different flight configurations have been tested to evaluate the potentiality and possible drawbacks of the previously mentioned UAS platform. Results confirmed that the fisheye images acquired with the Parrot Bebop 2 are suitable for 3D modelling, ensuring accuracies of the photogrammetric blocks of the order of the GSD (about 0.05 m normal to the optic axis in case of a flight height equal to 35 m).

It is of a highly technical nature with reliance on robotic systems to deliver intervention, engagement of diverse expertise, and early adoption of digital approaches to optimize and execute the application of this highly effective cancer treatment. As a localized intervention, the dependence on sensitive, specific, and accurate imaging to define the extent of disease, its heterogeneity, and adjacency to normal tissues directly affects the therapeutic ratio. Image-based in vivo temporal monitoring of the response to treatment enables adaptation and further affects the therapeutic ratio. Thus, more precise intervention will enable fractionation schedules that better interoperate with advances such as immunotherapy. In the data set–rich era that promises precision and personalized medicine, the radiation oncology field will integrate these new data into highly protocoled pathways of care that begin with multimodality prediction and enable patient-specific adaptation of therapy based on quantitative measures of the individual's dose–volume temporal trajectory and midtherapy predictions of response. In addition to advancements in computed tomography imaging, emerging technologies, such as ultra-high-field magnetic resonance and molecular imaging will bring new information to the design of treatments. Next-generation image guided radiation therapy systems will inject high specificity and sensitivity data and stimulate adaptive replanning. In addition, a myriad of pre- and peritherapeutic markers derived from advances in molecular pathology (eg, tumor genomics), automated and comprehensive imaging analytics (eg, radiomics, tumor microenvironment), and many other emerging biomarkers (eg, circulating tumor cell assays) will need to be integrated to maximize the benefit of radiation therapy for an individual patient. We present a perspective on the promise and challenges of fully exploiting imaging data in the pursuit of personalized radiation therapy, drawing from the presentations and broader discussions at the 2016 American Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology–National Cancer Institute workshop on Precision Medicine in Radiation Oncology (Bethesda, MD). © 2018","Article","Final","Scopus"

Exact quantification of the disease severity on different spatial scales is crucial for monitoring, management and resistance breeding activities. Based on the distinct yellow discolouration of attacked needles, it was investigated whether image analysis of digital photographs can be used to quantify disease severity and to improve phenotyping compared to conventional assessment in terms of time, effort and application range. The developed protocol for preprocessing and analysis of digital RGB images enabled identification of disease symptoms and healthy needle areas on images obtained in ground surveys (total number of analysed images n = 62) and by the use of a semiprofessional quadcopter (n = 13). Obtained disease severities correlated linearly with results obtained by manual counting of healthy and diseased needles for all approaches, including images of individual branches with natural background (R2 = 0.87) and with black background (R2 = 0.95), juvenile plants (R2 = 0.94), and top views and side views of entire tree crowns of adult trees (R2 = 0.98 and 0.88, respectively). Results underline that a well-defined signal related to needle bladder rust symptoms of Norway spruce can be extracted from images recorded by standard digital cameras and using drones.

Via the NextGen initiative, implementation of ADS-B technology across the US is planned in stages between 2012 and 2025. ADS-B's automatic one second epoch packet transmission exploits on-board GPS-derived navigational information to provide position information, as well as other information including vehicle identification, ground speed, vertical rate and track angle. The purpose of this technology is to improve surveillance data accuracy and provide access to better situational awareness to enable operational benefits such as shorter routes, reduced flight time and fuel burn, and reduced traffic delays, and to allow air traffic controllers to manage aircraft with greater safety margins. Other than the limited amount of information bits per packet that can be sent, ADS-B's other hard-limit limitation is capacity. Small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) can utilize limited ADS-B transmission power, in general, thus allowing this technology to be considered for use within a combined NAS and sUAS environment, but the potential number and density of sUAS predicted for future deployment calls into question the ability of ADS-B systems to meet the resulting capacity requirement. Hence, studies to understand potential limitations of ADS-B to fulfill capacity requirements in various sUAS scenarios are of great interest. In this paper we, validate/improve on, previous work performed by the MITRE Corporation concerning sUAS power and capacity in a sUAS and General Aviation (GA) mixed environment. In addition, we implement its inherent media access control layer capacity limitations which was not shown in the MITRE paper. Finally, a simple detect and avoid (DAA) algorithm is implemented to display that ADS-B technology is a viable technology for a mixed NAS/sUAS environment even in proposed larger mixed density environments. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Finding the right compound from a high-throughput screening (HTS) that could be optimized to a drug candidate is no simple task. Selecting meaningful compounds from a multitude of commercially available compounds is critical; over the years Institut Pasteur Korea (IPK), whose mission is to eliminate the global threat of infectious disease, had built a selected chemical library of commercially available and proprietary compounds sensitive to encompass structural diversity aspect. To obtain structural diversity, lead-like Bemis–Murcko substructures were generated from IPK legacy collections, and those compounds with different Bemis–Murcko substructures were selected. Furthermore, structural fingerprints were used to select diverse subsets of compounds. Based on the analyses of whole structures and substructures, we selected a diverse set to utilize against several infectious diseases models provided at IPK. We implemented a strategic approach to managing the chemical library by taking into consideration the stability of compounds while maintaining compounds integrity.

To perform blind deconvolution, which is also called blind image recovery, the blur kernel and image are represented by groups of sparse domains to exploit the local and nonlocal information such that a novel joint deblurring approach is conceived. In the proposed approach, the group sparse regularization on both the blur kernel and image is provided, where the sparse solution is promoted by ℓ1-norm. In addition, the reweighted data fidelity is developed to further improve the recovery performance, where the weight is determined by the estimation error. Moreover, to reduce the undesirable noise effects in group sparse representation, distance measures are studied in the block matching process to find similar patches. In such a joint deblurring approach, a more sophisticated two-step interactive process is needed in which each step is solved by means of the well-known split Bregman iteration algorithm, which is generally used to efficiently solve the proposed joint deblurring problem. Finally, numerical studies, including synthetic and real images, demonstrate that the performance of this joint estimation algorithm is superior to the previous state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both objective and subjective evaluation standards.

Our proposed algorithm uses two types of UAVs: global and local UAVs to collaboratively find the best deployment position in a dynamically changing environment. To obtain terrestrial network connectivity information and extract high-level network topology, we exploit the concept of strongly connected component in graph theory. Based on the understanding from a global point view, global UAVs recommend the most effective deployment positions to local UAVs so that they are deployed as relays in more critically disrupted areas.

However, UAV mobility can threaten the ability to maintain robust transmissions in practical deployments. On one hand, advanced software methodologies and extensive experiments are required to ensure safe and autonomous flights. On the other hand, to unlock additional capacity in drone communications, additional techniques must be leveraged such as directionality via MIMO-based beamforming, requiring accurate channel information to be fed back in- flight. Software defined radio (SDR) platforms play a major role in filling these gaps in multiple frequency bands, customizable design, and performance characterization. In this work, we present the hardware setup as well as software architecture of our proposed testbed leveraged for two different applications: autonomous mobility and beamforming. In the autonomous mobility case, we build a robust UAV-control framework on a customizable drone platform using MAVLink.

Because of the low cost of COTS sUAS and the prior success of these uses, this trend is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to the need to counter the malicious usage of sUAS (i.e., rogue sUAS). Researchers, the armed forces, and technologists have all proposed disparate solutions to this problem. There are no comprehensive and compact solutions capable of effectively tracking, identifying, and actively neutralizing the threats associated with rogue sUAS.

Given that their abandonment impoverishes territories and communities and raises natural, especially hydrogeological hazards, and that their deactivation leads to a loss of cultural identity, this paper aims to study rapid mapping systems for their detection. Since a deep relation between high land division and the use of terraces for the exploitation of territories has been recognized, a first detection method is based on cadastral maps. The joint use of regional-scale digital elevation models (DEMs) and cadastral dataset polygons, based on a model that typically uses GIS analyses, identifies areas with a high probability of terracing. A second method is based on the use of new technologies for very high-scale data collection. The DEM models derived from UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) photogrammetry, given their ability to determine the micro-topographical characterization of the terrain as well as the most expensive on-site techniques, can be considered an excellent low-cost means by which to locate terraced heritage. The proposed work includes comparative testing between methods implying GIS-based analysis of slope models. It aims to highlight the effectiveness of using both methods: regional-scale DEMs and cadastral maps to detect a high probability of terrace localization, and DEMs derived from the use of low-altitude aerial data and structure from motion (SfM) algorithms, which have greatly and effectively increased the use of aerial drone photogrammetry. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

Vehicular Floating Car Data (FCD) collection is a major representative of this paradigm. Massive data collection from floating vehicles is the key to Intelligent Transportation Systems. We address the design and performance evaluation of a data collection protocol for the use case of periodic data collection. We target robustness, optimizing the amount of data and the value of the collection period, keeping in mind the goals of autonomous node operation and minimal coordination effort. From a system point of view, we believe that best solutions should jointly exploit the Long Term Evolution (LTE) cellular access network and the Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) based Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET). Through a detailed comparative analysis, we show that such a hybrid approach offers superior performance, especially as for offloading the cellular radio access. A lightweight signaling procedure is designed, based on the DSRC VANET, which is able to avoid most of the duplicated data records, even if a distributed operation approach is pursued. The impact of the proposed protocol on the VANET load is evaluated and proved to be quite small, so that it does not interfere with other VANET-specific messages. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The lack of an established UAS benchmark for Detect, Sense and Avoid Systems put the preponderance of avoidance efforts on manned aircraft pilots to visually see and avoid potential collision threats. The small size, unusual configurations, and diverse operational applications of unmanned systems make UAS platforms difficult to visually identify. This paper sought to determine the mean visibility distance of small UAS systems (sUAS) to an alerted pilot flying a general aviation aircraft in visual meteorological conditions (VMC). The study evaluated mean visibility distance to various small UAS platforms based on a scripted set of UAS convergence conditions. The study utilized a quantitative, experimental design in which a general aviation aircraft was flown into a UAS operations area. Study pilots were instructed to locate a flying UAS aircraft without bearing assistance. Both the UAS and manned aircraft were assigned vertically de-conflicted altitudes with the UAS aircraft executing a series of converging and crossing courses relative to the manned aircraft. The distance at which the pilot visually located the UAS platform was timestamped and electronically recorded via a GPS tracking device. The various conditions were statistically analyzed to determine significant visibility differences among the various convergence conditions. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

As such systems grow ubiquitous, there is a commensurate need to protect against potentially catastrophic harm. System-level testing in simulation is a particularly promising approach for assuring robotics systems, allowing for more extensive testing in realistic scenarios and seeking bugs that may not manifest at the unit-level. Ideally, such testing could find critical bugs well before expensive field-testing is required. However, simulations can only model coarse environmental abstractions, contributing to a common perception that robotics bugs can only be found in live deployment. To address this gap, we conduct an empirical study on bugs that have been fixed in the widely used, open-source ArduPilot system. We identify bug-fixing commits by exploiting commenting conventions in the version-control history. We provide a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the bugs, focusing on characterising how the bugs are triggered and how they can be detected, with a goal of identifying how they can be best identified in simulation, well before field testing. To our surprise, we find that the majority of bugs manifest under simple conditions that can be easily reproduced in software-based simulation. Conversely, we find that system configurations and forms of input play an important role in triggering bugs. We use these results to inform a novel framework for testing for these and other bugs in simulation, consistently and reproducibly. These contributions can inform the construction of techniques for automated testing of robotics systems, with the goal of finding bugs early and cheaply, without incurring the costs of physically testing for bugs in live systems. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, as the data generated by these sensor nodes usually flow through open channel, so there are higher chances of various types of attacks either on the nodes or on to the data captured by these nodes. In this paper, we aim to design a new elliptic curve cryptography–based user authenticated key agreement protocol in a hierarchical WSN so that a legal user can only access the streaming data from generated from different sensor nodes. The proposed scheme is based upon 3-factor authentication, as it applies smart card, password, and personal biometrics of a user (for ticket generation). The proposed scheme maintains low computation cost for resource-constrained sensor nodes, as it uses efficient 1-way cryptographic hash function and bitwise exclusive-OR operations for secure key establishment between different sensor nodes. The security analysis using the broadly accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic, formal security verification using the popular simulation tool (automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications), and informal security show that the proposed scheme is resilient against several well-known attacks needed for a user authentication scheme in WSNs. The comparison of security and functionality requirements, communication and computation costs of the proposed scheme, and other related existing user authentication schemes shows the superior performance of the proposed scheme.

The UMTS authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol was the first protocol proposed to authenticate the communication entities in the UMTS network. The protocol fulfills the security demands such as mutual authentication, integrity and confidentiality. However, the existing UMTS-AKA protocol is susceptible to network vulnerabilities that leads to impersonation, denial of service, man in the middle and identity catching attack on the UMTS network. In view of these congenital vulnerabilities of UMTS-AKA, several AKA protocols were proposed by the researchers but these protocols fail to overcome all the security weakness. Moreover, none of the existing UMTS-AKA protocol overcome the single key exposure problem. To overcome these problems, we introduced the security enhanced and computationally efficient (SEACE) protocol for UMTS networks. The proposed protocol preserves the privacy of the MS, resolves the single key exposure problem and avoids all the identified attacks from the communication network. The security analysis of the SEACE-AKA protocol is carried out using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The analysis shows that the protocol achieves security goals and secure against various known attacks. The performance analysis of the proposed protocol with existing AKA protocols shows that the SEACE-AKA protocol generates less overhead and fulfills all security requirements of the UMTS network. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Further, only the links between the UAV and ground devices are evaluated, without assumption of a wide information diffusion range. Herein, we propose a novel multihop D2D communication method that exploits UAV technology and uniquely designed virtual cells to achieve information diffusion to remote areas. Moreover, we establish a model to evaluate the trade-off between the UAV flight energy consumption and the communication performance between the UAV and mobile devices.

Also, this is a special case of secret sharing, because secret data cannot be extracted from any stego image. In the literature, the frequencies of occurrence of secret data were used as reference information for data encoding, in which most digits were transformed into smaller ones. The encoding strategy can effectively decrease the modification level of the pixel. However, only limited literature has analyzed the relationship between the adjacent secret data. In this paper, we proposed an exclusive-or (XOR)-based encoding method to convert the neighboring values, thereby reducing the distortion. Since there are significant similarities between the two stego images and the original image, the first stego image is stored on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to avoid a hacker's interception attack. The second stego image on the UAV is sent to the command station. After completion of the UAV mission, the proposed method extracts the secret data from the two stego images to identify whether the second stego image has been tampered with. © 2018 by the author.","Article","Final","Scopus"

CAN allows electronic control units (ECUs) to communicate with each other. ECUs control various function of vehicle systems such as engine and transmission control. Therefore, CAN and ECUs are the high priority targets by hackers. If the CAN and the connected components are attacked, the vehicle may cause serious malfunction and fatal accidents. However, it is hard to find out the exact CAN messages to send and control the vehicle as intended by hackers. Likewise, vehicle security researchers have the same problem to find out the exact meaning of CAN messages to detect sophisticated attacks as well as attackers. It is relatively easy to detect the simple pattern of attacks such as denial of service (DoS) attack. However, CAN specification information is private information of car OEMs, to reveal the exact meaning of CAN messages, we need to analyze the messages by reverse engineering techniques, which is time-consuming and laborious tasks. To solve this problem, we developed the Automated CAN Analyzer (ACA). The ACA has automated reverse engineering functions which can help to analyze the relationship between the response data from a diagnostic query of on-board diagnostics II (OBD-II) and the related CAN traffic data. Furthermore, it supports the automated attack function that can inject fake messages into CAN bus based on pre-analyzed CAN message information. Researchers can easily confirm whether the reverse engineering results are correctly working or not through the provided automated attack function. As a result, the ACA could lower the barriers to entry to in-vehicle network research. To evaluate the ACA, we applied our approach to two real vehicles, Hyundai YF Sonata (2010 model) and KIA Soul (2014 model). In this paper, we can find out the meaning of CAN messages on both vehicles with the help of the ACA. Additionally, since modern vehicles are all equipped with OBD-II, our approach can be applied to most vehicle widely. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Firstly, multi-hop D2D links are established to extend the coverage of UAV emergency networks with limited transmit power.

In the context of security and law enforcement, recently the number of accidents and incidents involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have increased significantly with million of dollars losses being reported. Therefore, research on (DoA) estimation for the localization of intruding UAVs is crucial to develop systems to avoid these losses in the future. Previous works on (DoA) estimation via received signal strength (RSS) value used a conformal antenna array over a platonic solid geometry and applied the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm. Since MUSIC is proposed for omni directional antennas, when the antenna has a high directivity, MUSIC is no longer suitable for RSS-based algorithms. In a previous work, we proposed a novel algorithm for RSS-based (DoA) estimation. In this paper, we propose an enhanced framework using arrays of directional antennas for (DoA) estimation with the motivation of localizing drones exploiting their transmitted NTSC signal. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework for different angular spacing between the antennas on the array. We evaluate its the performance for two different directivity gain patterns of the antennas. Finally, we validate our framework experimentally using off-the-shelf antennas and acquire signals using a software defined radio (SDR) in a measurement campaign.

Automated synthesis of approximate circuits is performed via functional approximation, in which various parts of the target circuit are extensively examined with a library of approximate components/transformations to trade off the functional accuracy and computational budget (i.e., power). However, as the number of possible approximate transformations increases, traditional search techniques suffer from a combinatorial explosion due to the large branching factor. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for automated synthesis of approximate circuits from either structural or behavioral descriptions. We adapt the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), as a stochastic search technique, to deal with the large design space exploration, which enables a broader range of potential possible approximations through lightweight random simulations.

Fast, robust and accurate simulation of the complex hydrogen behavior in the nuclear containment is the first but critical step for hydrogen risk mitigation. GASFLOW-MPI is a widely used CFD numerical tool which provides the fast and reliable prediction, because of its parallel computational capability and well-validated models. However, due to its manual input-card based mesh generation, the whole meshing process is slow and lacks user friendliness. Therefore, a fast automatic mesh generation module is of importance and profit for practical industrial applications. Nowadays, Computer Aid Design (CAD) has become the formal standard for project design and preview. In this work, a mesh generation module is developed for GASFLOW-MPI, which directly uses the CAD file as the input for automatic mesh generation. The module exploits a voxelization-based method, which seeks to generate a Cartesian mesh by tracing rays directed into the geometry. The complexity of the mesh generation algorithm is also analyzed. Three models, including a toy problem, a steam generator compartment model, and a complex full scale reactor containment model are used to validate the new developed automated mesh generation module. The results show that meshes are generated at fast construction speed and well match the original CAD models. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

In particular, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) together with highly-directional multi-antenna transmission techniques in mmWave frequency bands are utilized for improving spectral efficiency.

We propose two approaches: One derived from a deterministic UCB-like method and the other relying on Thompson sampling.

As it contains ten flexible rotational bonds, the possible spatial conformations have been identified theoretically. The spectral signatures of monomer and dimer structures of chlorambucil and the frequency shifts due to non-covalent interactions (NCIs) have been illustrated using FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra. The bond correlation between carbon and hydrogen nuclei of chlorambucil has been obtained using 2D-HSQC NMR spectrum. The assignments of harmonic normal modes have been done in order to find the vibrational contributions of each functional group. Besides the spectroscopic studies, the electron density based quantum topological atoms in molecule analysis have been performed to explore the possible interactions between the non-bonded atoms. The reduced density gradient and isosurface plots have been used in this study to understand the strength of NCIs. The charge delocalization patterns of monomer and dimer structures were explained so as to investigate the chemical stability profile. The active sites for the electrophilic and nucleophilic attack on the monomer conformers have been determined by applying Hirshfeld charges and atomic spin densities into Fukui and Parr functions, respectively. From the automated docking analysis, it is found that chlorambucil interacts with the aldo-keto reductase family 1 (AKR1B1, AKR1B10, AKR1B15) and FAD-linked sulfhydryl oxidase ALR proteins through strong hydrogen bonds and shows a potential inhibition. In order to take into account the interactions ranging from short to long range, the modern density functionals viz.

This article proposes an intelligent image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control method for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

The weak handling of this gain, affect the maintaining of tracked features in the area of view. Unlike the classical VS scheme that requires a known value of gain, selected in a heuristic way, which lead the controller to fall in the velocity convergence problem. We adjust an adaptive gain value by the use of a fuzzy logic controller. The proposed controller exploits the error between feature vectors and its derivative as inputs. Furthermore, we design an intelligent based-fuzzy logic method for gain tuning of PD controllers applied for handling the heading and position of the quadrotor.

Firstly, we employ a jammer detection method combining the Received Signal Strength (RSS) with Packet Error Rate (PER). After the jammer is detected, our designed RSS based jammer localization algorithm is presented, which can estimate the jammer position and jamming signal power simultaneously. However, localization noises often exist in practical scenarios, and therefore the estimated jammer information is usually with uncertainties. To overcome these uncertainties, we propose a robust path planning method of successful jammer evasion. More specifically, the proposed method can guarantee the worst-case performance so that the communication quality can be always better than a certain level under all possible uncertainties.

These vehicles have been growing in popularity among hobbyist and also as industrial solutions for specific activities. The flying characteristics and the absence of a crew on board of these devices allow them to perform a wide variety of activities, which can be inaccessible to humans or may threat their life. Despite the advantages, they also bring up major concerns regarding security breaches in the flight controller software, which may lead to security (e.g., vehicle hijacking by attackers), safety (e.g., crashing the vehicle into a planned area or building), or privacy (e.g., eavesdropping or stealing video footage) problems. GPS spoofing is one the main threat of UAVs. The predictability and knowledge of GPS signal properties, create conditions to attackers to assume control of the UAV and use it for their own objectives. In this paper the GPS spoofing effect on UAV is analyzed through a series of tests, under a simulation environment.

Thus, it is critical that a driver be made situationally aware as quickly as possible in those conditions where he or she may not be paying full attention. Recent research suggests that specific cues about upcoming hazards (e.g., “crosswalk ahead”) can increase the drivers’ situation awareness during these safety-critical take-over situations when compared with a general cue (“take over control”). The current study examines whether this increased situation awareness which occurs as a result of more specific cues translates into improved hazard mitigation performance within the same limited time window. Method: Fifty-seven drivers were randomly assigned to one of five between-subjects conditions (one control condition and four experimental auditory cue conditions) that varied in the specificity of information provided about an upcoming hazard. The four experimental conditions included a period of conditional automated driving where the driver was engaged in a driving-irrelevant task and looked away from the forward roadway prior to a take-over request. Drivers in the fifth condition had no cue and drove manually throughout. The same six simulator scenarios were used in all five conditions to evaluate how well the driver mitigated a hazard. The average velocity, standard deviation of velocity, and average absolute acceleration were recorded along with the glance behaviors of drivers. Results: In general, during the 4 s prior to a latent hazard (following the alerting cues in the automated driving conditions), the more likely a driver was to glance towards a latent hazard, the more likely the driver was to reduce his or her speed. Moreover, analyses focusing solely on hazard mitigation behavior revealed patterns that mirrored the glance behavior results. Specifically, drivers that were presented with cues that described the environments in which hazards were likely to occur were more likely to demonstrate vehicle behaviors that were consistent with speed reductions (lower velocity, higher speed variability, and higher absolute acceleration) than were drivers who were presented general cues or cues about the identity of the upcoming hazards. Conclusion: Even in as little as 4 s prior to a potential hazard, cues that inform the driver of the environment in which the hazard is likely to occur increase the likelihood that the driver mitigates the crash compared with drivers who are provided general information or threat identity information. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this letter, we develop a search-based trajectory planning algorithm that exploits the quadrotor maneuverability to generate sequences of motion primitives in cluttered environments. We model the quadrotor body as an ellipsoid and compute its flight attitude along trajectories in order to check for collisions against obstacles. The ellipsoid model allows the quadrotor to pass through gaps that are smaller than its diameter with nonzero pitch or roll angles. Without any prior information about the location of gaps and associated attitude constraints, our algorithm is able to find a safe and optimal trajectory that guides the robot to its goal as fast as possible. To accelerate planning, we first perform a lower dimensional search and use it as a heuristic to guide the generation of a final dynamically feasible trajectory.

Given relatively slow dynamics associated with the state of charge and temperature response in electrified vehicles with large batteries, a long prediction/planning horizon is needed to achieve improved energy efficiency benefits. In this paper, we develop a two-layer Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for battery thermal and energy management of electric vehicle (EV), aiming at improving fuel economy through real-time prediction and optimization. In the first layer, the long-term traffic flow information and an approximate model reflective of the relatively slow battery temperature dynamics are leveraged to minimize energy consumption required for battery cooling while maintaining the battery temperature within the desired operating range. In the second layer, the scheduled battery thermal and state of charge (SOC) trajectories planned to achieve long-term battery energyoptimal thermal behavior are used as the reference over a short horizon to regulate the battery temperature. Additionally, an intelligent online constraint handling (IOCH) algorithm is developed to compensate for the mismatch between the actual and predicted driving conditions and reduce the chance for battery temperature constraint violation. The simulation results show that, depending on the driving cycle, the proposed two-layer MPC is able to save 2.8 - 7.9% of the battery energy compared to the traditional rule-based controller in connected and automated vehicle (CAV) operation scenario. Moreover, as compared to a single layer MPC with a long horizon, the two-layer structure of the proposed MPC solution reduces significantly the computing effort without compromising the performance. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The transportation of these valuable resources greatly depends on pipelines; however, pipeline leakages have huge economic and environmental impacts warranting an effective operational methodology for pipeline monitoring. We proposed a method for mapping soil contamination due to pipeline leakage in Dixonville, Alberta, Canada. In particular, very high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery and electromagnetic induction (EM) surveying data were analyzed using a hierarchical object-based random forest (RF) algorithm. In level-1 classification, a land cover map was produced using UAV data. Next, all land cover classes, excluding contaminated soil, were masked out. In level-2 classification, the contaminated soil class was further partitioned into three subclasses representing varying degrees of contamination. Specifically, we proposed a salinity index, named the normalized salinity index, to detect areas of soil contamination. The salinity index proposed herein, as well as several other salinity indices and UAV bands, were used as input features for level-2 classification. An overall classification accuracy of about 77% was achieved for level-2 classification using the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the synergistic use of high spatial resolution UAV imagery and EM data is very promising for detecting soil contamination and examining ecosystem disturbance due to pipeline leakage. © 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Article","Final","Scopus"

An ensemble Kalman filter is employed to assimilate the dropwindsonde observations at the vortex scale. With the assimilation of GH dropwindsondes, TCs generally exhibit fewer position and intensity errors, a better wind-pressure relationship, and improved representation of integrated kinetic energy in the analyses. The resulting track and intensity forecasts with all the cases generally show a positive impact when GH dropwindsondes are assimilated. The impact of GH dropwindsondes is further explored with cases stratified by intensity change and presence of crewed aircraft data. GH dropwindsondes demonstrate a larger impact for nonsteady-state TCs [non-SS; 24-h intensity change larger than 20 kt (~10 m s-1)] than for steady-state (SS) TCs. The relative skill from assimilating GH dropwindsondes ranges between 25% and 35% for either the position or intensity improvement in the final analyses overall, but only ~5%-10% for SS cases alone. The resulting forecasts for non-SS cases show higher skill for both track and intensity than SS cases. In addition, the GH dropwindsonde impact on TC forecasts varies in the presence of crewed aircraft data. An increased intensity improvement at long lead times is seen when crewed aircraft data are absent. This demonstrates the importance of strategically designing flight patterns to exploit the sampling strengths of the GH and crewed aircraft in order to maximize data impacts on TC prediction. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To mitigate attacks, remote attestation (RA) has emerged as a distinct security service that aims at detecting malware presence on an embedded device. Most prior RA schemes focus on attesting a single device and do not scale. In recent years, schemes for collective (group or swarm) RA have been designed. However, none is applicable to autonomous and dynamic network settings.

It does not only provide raw material and food, but also provides large employment opportunities. Therefore, agriculture requires modern technology for increasing the productivity. In this context, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) could be utilized for monitoring the climatic parameters such as (temperature, humidity, light, carbon dioxide, soil moisture, acidity etc.) in an agriculture field. The climatic parameters are very important in terms of growth, quality and productivity of crops. But, any kind of interception, modification, insertion, and deletion on these parameters can have negative effect on crop. Therefore, security and privacy are important issues in agriculture field. In this regard, we design a novel remote user authentication scheme using wireless sensor networks for agriculture monitoring. The protocol is validated through Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic and also simulated using Automated Validation Information Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. We formally analyze the security of the scheme using random oracle model. In addition, the informal security analysis shows that the proposed protocol is secure and resists various kinds of malicious attacks.

We start with a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) on ImageNet as the base network for initialization. We then adapt this network to the structure of one-shot video object segmentation (OSVOS) to obtain the parent network, which is trained on 50 X-ray angiography sequences for extracting blood vessels. Finally, the model is further fine-tuned using 10 specific coronary angiography sequences to achieve real-time vascular segmentation.

Due to increased demand, the allocated spectrum at the 5.9 GHz band for vehicular communication cannot be used efficiently for larger payloads to improve cooperative sensing, safety, and mobility. To achieve higher data rates, the millimeter-wave (mmWave) automotive radar spectrum at 76-81 GHz band can be exploited for communication. However, instead of employing spectral isolation or interference mitigation schemes between communication and radar, we design a joint system for vehicles to perform both functions using the same waveform. In this paper, we propose radar processing methods that use pilots in the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform. While the radar receiver exploits pilots for sensing, the communication receiver can leverage pilots to estimate the time-varying channel. The simulation results show that proposed radar processing can be efficiently implemented and meet the automotive radar requirements.

In addition to designing strategies that seek to prevent such negative events, it is vital that an autonomous system remains able to achieve its control objective even if the system partially loses control authority. While loss of authority limits the system's control capabilities, it may be possible to use the remaining authority in such a way that the system's control objectives remain achievable. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal design for an autonomous system with discrete-time linear dynamics where the available control actions depend on adversarial input produced as a result of loss of authority. The central question is how to partition the set of control inputs that the system can apply in such a way that the system state remains within a safe set regardless of an adversarial input limiting the available control inputs to a single partition elements. We interpret such a problem first as a variant of a safety game, and then as a problem of existence of an appropriate edge labeling on a graph. We obtain conditions for existence and a computationally efficient algorithm for determining a system design and a control policy that preserve system safety. We illustrate our results on two examples: a damaged autonomous vehicle and a method of communication over a channel that ensures a minimal running digital sum. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To be specific, it explores the 3-D antenna gain in the air-to-ground links and uses the Matérn hardcore point process to guarantee the safety distance between the randomly deployed UAV base stations. In addition, we propose the transmit jamming strategy to improve the secrecy performance in which part of UAVs send jamming signals to confound the eavesdroppers.

Besides conventional PKI function for security, SCMS features privacy protection mechanisms. SCMS will become the largest PKI in the word and considers efficiency in its design. However, SCMS itself becomes the target of security attacks, leading to safety-of-life risk in connected and autonomous vehicles. Securing SCMS will undergo battles as new threats emerge, which needs to update defense such as misbehavior detection. Some challenges remain open, like efficient distribution of certificate revocation lists. In addition, certain solutions, like butterfly key expansion, do not withstand post-quantum cryptanalysis. This paper presents an SCMS Emulation Lab (EmuLab) designed at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. EmuLab facilitates research to strengthen SCMS security with a functional SCMS framework. Two sets of experiments on EmuLab demonstrate how pseudonym certificates work and how SCMS self-heals when a root certificate authority is compromised. Emulation supplements field tests for proof-of-concept at a large scale with no danger to life. Its high fidelity provides more realistic results than that offered by simulation on experimenting new defense mechanics.

However, the modules based on computer vision suffer from the performance degradation problem, when there is distribution discrepancy between the practically captured data and the training data. In this paper, we address this problem by learning an one-step transformation to bridge the discrepancy from source domain to target domain. Since the feature space learned by labeled source data is well-trained, the target data firstly are directly mapped to this feature space. With regard the domain discrepancy, the distribution of source and target features need to be further aligned. We model the aligning process as an one-step transformation and implement it as one layer convolutional neural network. In order to effectively learn the one-step transformation, a new adversarial loss function is proposed to minimize the Wasserstein distance of involving domains and the prediction error simultaneously. The experiments are conducted on six datasets, including the challenging traffic-related data,e.g. traffic sign images and the pedestrian fisheye images captured by the cameras installed in a moving vehicle. The results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed method in comparison with other eight classical recognition methods. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) play the principal role in learning high level feature representations from visual inputs. It is crucial to know how reliable those neural networks are as human lives can be at stake. Recent experiments on the robustness of CNNs show that they are highly susceptible to small adversarial perturbations. Due to the increasing popularity of mobile devices, there is a significant demand for CNN models which are smaller enough to run on a mobile device without sacrificing the accuracy. Although recent researches have been successful at achieving smaller models with comparable accuracy on standard image datasets, their robustness to adversarial attacks has not been studied. However, massive deployment of smaller models on millions of mobile devices stresses importance of their robustness. In this work, we study how robust such models are with respect to state-of-the-art compression techniques such as quantization. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) insights to achieve smaller and robust models (2) a compression framework which is adversarial-aware. Our findings reveal that compressed models are naturally more robust than compact models. This provides an incentive to perform compression rather than designing compact models. Additionally, the latter provides benefits of increased accuracy and higher compression rate, up to 90×. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The motivating example is localizing a team of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), where GPS is not available to all agents, acoustic range-only measurements are common, and compass bias as well as environmental disturbances must be overcome. Significant work has been done in cooperative localization, however the idea of localization under the described conditions has not received much attention.

We then reduce the observability matrix to a metric that we exploit for planning observability maximizing agent trajectories under sensor bias and environmental disturbance.

An array of 106 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), CO, CH4, and CO2 were analyzed and compared between the aerial samples (300-m height) and the ground-level samples in pairs to inspect for vertical mixing of the trace gases at a coastal site under three different meteorological conditions of local circulation, frontal passage, and high-pressure peripheral circulation. A rather homogeneous composition was observed for the sample pairs immediately after the frontal passage, indicating a well-mixed condition below 300 m. In contrast, inhomogeneous mixing was observed for the sample pairs under the other two conditions (local circulation and high-pressure peripheral circulation), suggesting different layers of air masses. Furthermore, information of unique source markers, composition profiles, and lifetimes of compounds were used to differentiate the origins of the air masses aloft and at the surface to substantiate the observed inhomogeneity. The study demonstrates that, with the availability of the near-surface aerial sampling coupling with in-laboratory analysis, detailed compositions of trace gases can now be readily obtained with superior data quality.

Conventional sweep monitoring method provides balanced coverage but cannot adapt to variable situations, such as the return of UAVs for refueling. This paper proposes a pheromone-based method for UAV swarm anti-piracy monitoring. In this method, the environment is modeled by a pheromone map, and the motion of UAVs is guided by the strength of pheromones. A ship-centered convening mechanism is proposed to increase the chance of finding pirates by taking the interactions between pirates and merchant ships into account. A prediction-reservation mechanism is proposed to improve the deficiencies of the implicit intention propagation mechanism when the ship-centered convening mechanism is used. Simulation experiments are conducted to study the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method reduces the success rate of pirate attack by 8% at most compared to the sweep method, and that the prediction-reservation mechanism performs better than the implicit intention propagation mechanism, especially with large number of UAVs. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Based on the Discriminative Correlation Filter (DCF) algorithm, this paper proposes a new tracking algorithm DCF-GA (Discriminative Correlation Filter with Generation of Adversarial example) to achieve anti-occlusion in the scenario of UAV. Firstly, we design a mask selection strategy to generate the adversarial example with occlusion, which can enhance the antiocclusion performance of our algorithm. The response losses of DCF reveal the impacts of adversaries so that they are used to select an appropriate mask. And then, we provide an optimization scheme of object feature selection based on the singular values extracted from histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) feature and convolutional neural network (CNN) feature respectively. Moreover, to overcome the scale changes of the object image, a multidimensional templates set is proposed and the best one is determined by the maximum of their DCF responses. Finally, we add the background patches around the region of interest (ROI) into the sample set to suppress the background clutter. The tracking algorithm we proposed in this paper is compared with some other algorithms in both the UAV video sequence and the OTB dataset.

There are legal issues with the operation of these vehicles in nonsegregated airspace, and a pressing requirement to solve these issues is the development and testing of reliable and safe mechanisms to avoid collision in flight. In this article, we describe a sense and avoid subsystem developed for a maritime patrol unmanned air system. The article starts with a description of the unmanned air system, that was developed specifically for maritime patrol operations, and proceeds with a discussion of possible ways to guarantee that the unmanned air system does not collide with other flying objects. In the system developed, the position of the unmanned air system is obtained by the global positioning system and that of other flying objects is reported via a data link with a ground control station. This assumes that the detection of those flying objects is done by a radar in the ground or by self-reporting via a traffic monitoring system (such as automatic identification system). The algorithm developed is based on game theory. The approach is to handle both the procedures, threat detection phase and collision avoidance maneuver, in a unified fashion, where the optimal command for each possible relative attitude of the obstacle is computed off-line, therefore requiring low processing power for real-time operation.

We exploit the two UAVs' trajectories as new design degrees of freedom to not only enhance the downlink energy transfer performance, but also mitigate the uplink inter-user interference. Under this setup, we maximize the uplink common (minimum) throughput of the two users over a finite UAV mission period, by optimizing the two UAVs' trajectories, jointly with the wireless resource allocation, subject to the UAVs' maximum flying speed and collision avoidance constraints, as well as the users' energy neutrality constraints.

As new scheduling algorithms are being developed particularly to leverage and accommodate connected and autonomous vehicles, there is increased potential for cyber-attacks on TSC that can undermine the benefits of new algorithms. Attackers can learn the behavior of scheduling algorithms and launch attacks to get scheduling priority and/or to create traffic panic and congestion. These attacks can compromise the system and significantly increase traffic delay and make TSC completely ineffective. In this paper, we compare the performance of different backpressure-based scheduling algorithms when they are under attack. We consider four different backpressure-based schemes, namely, delay-based, queue-based, sum-of-delay-based, and hybrid scheme that combines delay-based and queue-based schemes. We consider time spoofing attacks where individual vehicles arriving at an intersection can alter their arrival times. Through detailed simulation analysis we show that while the delay-based scheme has better fairness performance, it is more vulnerable to time spoofing attacks than the other schemes. We explore drawbacks of the delay-based scheme under different scenarios including non-homogeneous arrivals both for isolated intersection as well as multiple intersections.

A technique called over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged to be a promising solution for high-mobility sensing, which integrates functional computation (e.g., averaging and geometric mean) and multi-access by exploiting analog waveform addition. Targeting high-mobility sensing, the technique supports ultra-fast simultaneous access and function computation. In this paper, building on multi-antenna AirComp, we present a new frame-work of wirelessly powered (WP) AirComp to enable UAVs for simultaneous data aggregation and wirelessly powering sensors, where wireless power solves a key design challenge of battery recharging for many sensors. The key feature of WP-AirComp is the leverage of down-link wireless power transfer (WPT) as an additional design dimension for reducing the sum computation error in up-link AirComp. Designing the framework involves the joint optimization of power control, energy beamforming and AirComp equalization. To derive a practical solution, we recast the non-convex problem into equivalent outer and inner problems for (inner) wireless power control and energy beamforming and (outer) AirComp equalization, respectively. The former is solved in closed form while the latter via semi-definite relaxation, which is shown to reach the global optimum with high probability. The solution reveals that the optimal power beams point to the WPT channels, and the optimal power allocation tends to equalize the round-trip attenuation over sensors. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The proposed scheme exploits the location information of multiple UAVs and adapts the transmit power based on the UAV distance from the transmitting base station (BS). The location information enables the BS to dynamically adapt the transmit power over the UAVs entire flight time to maximize the average sum rate. The average sum rate and power allocated to the UAVs during the flight time are used as the performance metrics. In addition, the proposed scheme is compared with the fixed power allocation scheme, and the results give useful insight into UAV location-aware communication. The simulation results show that at low transmit power, a sum rate improvement can be achieved when the adaptive power transmission scheme is applied as compared to a fixed transmit power schemes. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

If one vehicle is compromised and suddenly brakes, these AVs will most likely be unable to prevent a collision. In this work, we propose a proactive approach to platooning security: Autonomous Vehicle contracts, in which AVs are architected to use secure enclaves to enforce agreed-upon driving rules, such as a restriction not to brake harder than a certain threshold while the contract is in effect. We explore whether AV contracts will be feasible in worst-case emergency situations while simultaneously under attack, when it is imperative to return full autonomy to AVs as soon as possible. Through our prototype contract implementation using Intel SGX enclaves, including measurement from real-world testing of wireless On-Board Units (OBUs), we show that AV contracts can be quickly and safely terminated in the event of an emergency while retaining a false positive rate of under 0.001% per 10 hours of use. We find that individual autonomy can be returned to the vehicles of an 8-vehicle platoon under contract within 1.5 seconds of an attack, including both detection and safe vehicle separation. Smaller platoons are even quicker. Consequently, automobile manufacturers may find the additional safety offered by AV contracts to provide a net benefit. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Inter-genus exchange of genetic information is of utmost importance in this context. Objectives: Here, to the best of our knowledge, we describe the first detection and characterization of a KPC-2-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Germany. Methods: Characterization of the isolate was performed using MALDI-TOF MS, automated microdilution and MLST. Carbapenemase detection was performed using phenotypic and genotypic assays. The bla                             KPC-2                             -carrying plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli NEB® 10-beta. The purified plasmid DNA was sequenced using the Illumina technique. Results: The isolate expressed ST235 and was resistant to carbapenems.

By exploring the distinct properties of the undetectable and indistinguishable attacks to a CPS, novel explicit criteria on the detectability and distinguishability of the CPS under attack are proposed in terms of the r-resilient observability. This enables us to explicitly characterize the undetectable and/or indistinguishable attacks to the CPS. Then based on such characterization, we propose a finite time detector to solve the attack detection problem and a finite time alarm event driven supervised estimator to solve the secure state estimation problem, separately. Theoretical analysis shows that, the proposed detector and estimator can detect attacks and estimate the state within a prescribed finite time, respectively.

The process becomes laborious when the annotation is done manually for the availability of a large number of text corpora. Hence, future automated extraction systems will be essential for groups of experts such as doctors and medical practitioners as well as non-experts such as patients, to ensure enhanced clinical decision-making for improving healthcare systems. Such extraction systems can be developed using medical concepts and concept-related features as the part of a structured corpus. The latter can assist in assigning the category and sentiment to each of the medical concepts and their lexical contexts. These categories and sentiment assignments constitute semantic relations of medical concepts, with their context, represented by sentences of the corpus. This paper presents a new domain-based knowledge lexicon coupled with a machine learning approach to extract semantic relations. This is done by assigning category and sentiment of the medical concepts and contexts. The categories considered in this research, are diseases, symptoms, drugs, human_anatomy, and miscellaneous medical terms, whereas sentiments are considered as positive and negative. The proposed assignment systems are developed on the top of WordNet of Medical Event (WME) lexicon. The developed lexicon provides medical concepts and their features, namely Parts-Of-Speech (POS), gloss (descriptive explanation), Similar Sentiment Words (SSW), affinity score, gravity score, polarity score, and sentiment. Several well-known supervised classifiers, including Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and support vector-based Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) have been applied to evaluate the developed systems. The proposed approaches have resulted in a concepts clustering application by identifying the semantic relations of concepts. The application provides potential exploitation in several domains, such as medical ontologies and recommendation systems. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

X-ray examination technology is a nondestructive screening method that enables the contents and internal structures of objects to be viewed without destroying the packaging or the external structures. Owing to its speed and efficiency compared to manual inspection, this technology is especially useful for the inspection of checked luggage and cargo, especially for inspecting items that cannot be disassembled. This paper presents developed training software for automated X-ray image recognition for checked luggage. To obtain the optimum classification result, an algorithm is designed using the C++ language. In Taiwan, the intensity of X-ray equipment is 10 times that of a typical X-ray baggage inspection machine. The use of reflected thermal neutrons in this equipment can reveal the presence of drugs, weapons, or explosives that are hidden in luggage. Using the Harris corner detection method and the speeded-up robust features (SURF) algorithm, the corner and feature points are obtained.

Specifically, we propose a novel coalition formation approach of the PSN users, following a Chinese Restaurant Process that jointly considers their communication interest, physical distance, and energy availability. To further improve energy efficiency, we rely on the Wireless Powered Communications technique, enabling PSN users to harvest energy from a mobile Unmanned Vehicle (UV)-assisted base station. Then each user transmits its data in a two-step fashion through the coalition-head that is connected to. Users optimal transmission powers are obtained by formulating the corresponding power control problem as a non-cooperative, distributed game among users, concluding to a unique Nash equilibrium. Finally, a dynamic framework that calculates the optimal location of the mobile base station is devised, towards maximizing the PSN's energy availability and prolonging the system's lifetime. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through modeling and simulation under several scenarios, and its superiority is demonstrated. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This paper proposes a new path planning algorithm for fixed wing UAVs based on genetic algorithm (GA) and Dubins curve theory. Path planning is treated as a global optimization problem under certain constraints, including the velocity vectors of initial and goal points and the minimum turning radius of UAVs. Dubins curve theory is utilized to satisfy the velocity vector constraints. GA is utilized to generate the shortest threats avoidance path in a 2D environment. A new encoding scheme is proposed, taking into account initial circles, goal circles, threats circles and the positional relationship between the path and these circles. The 2D Dubins path is converted to Dubins airplane path by adding a flight-path angle to it. The algorithm was tested in a complex flight environment and the planned path was tracked by a 6DOF Simulink model of a fixed wing UAV. Results show that the algorithm can generate shortest threats avoidance path in a complicated 3D environment and meanwhile satisfy constraints mentioned above. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences 2018.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this study, we evaluated a new RSI/mechanical ventilation protocol in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock. Methods: We included consecutive adult patients who were transferred to the emergency department. The RSI protocol included 5 phases: preoxygenation, pretreatment, induction/paralysis, intubation, and mechanical ventilation (PPIIM). A posteriori, we selected historical patients managed with standard RSI as a control group. The primary outcome was hemodynamic derangement or hypoxemia from enrollment until intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Results: We studied 31 consecutive patients who were intubated using the PPIIM protocol and 22 historical controls. We found significant differences in systolic (85.32 ± 4.23 vs 71.72 ± 7.98 mm Hg; P < 0.0001), diastolic (58.84 ± 5.84 vs 39.05 ± 5.63 mm Hg; P < 0.0001), and mean arterial pressure (67.71 ± 4.90 vs 49.90 ± 5.66 mm Hg; P < 0.0001), as well as in partial pressure of oxygen (85.80 ± 19.82 vs 164.73 ± 43.07 mm Hg; P < 0.0001) between the PPIIM and control group at 5 minutes of automated ventilation.

However, the further adoption of UAVs has been significantly impeded by an overwhelming public outcry over the privacy implications of drone technology. While lawmakers have attempted to establish standards for drone use (e.g., No-Fly-Zones (NFZs)), at present a general technical mechanism for policy enforcement eludes state-of-the-art drones. In this work, we propose that Proof-of-Alibi (PoA) protocols should serve as the basis for enforcing drone privacy compliance. We design and implement AliDrone, a trustworthy PoA protocol that enables individual drones to prove their compliance with NFZs to a third party Auditor. AliDrone leverages trusted hardware to produce cryptographically-signed GPS readings within a secure enclave, preventing malicious drone operators from being able to forge geo-location information. AliDrone features an adaptive sampling algorithm that reacts to NFZ proximity in order to minimize the processing cost. Through laboratory benchmarks and field studies, we demonstrate that AliDrone provides strong assurance of geo-location while imposing an average of 1.5% overhead on CPU utilization and 0.3% of memory consumption. AliDrone thus enables the further proliferation of drone technology through the introduction of a trustworthy and accountable compliance mechanism. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, there are a lack of comprehensive data from many countries in this region determining historic and current MDR prevalence. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a leading cause of both acute infant diarrhea and traveler's diarrhea in Nepal. The MDR prevalence and associated resistance mechanisms of ETEC isolates responsible for enteric infections in Nepal are largely unknown. Methods: A total of 265 ETEC isolates were obtained from acute diarrheal samples (263/265) or patient control samples (2/265) at traveler's clinics or regional hospitals in Nepal from 2001 to 2016. Isolates were screened for antibiotic resistance, to include extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production, via the Microscan Automated Microbiology System. ETEC virulence factors, specifically enterotoxins and colonization factors (CFs), were detected using multiplex PCR, and prevalence in the total isolate population was compared to ESBL-positive isolates. ESBL-positive isolates were assessed using multiplex PCR for genetic markers potentially responsible for observed resistance. Results: A total of 118/265 (44.5%) ETEC isolates demonstrated resistance to ≥2 antibiotics. ESBL-positive phenotypes were detected in 40/265 isolates, with isolates from 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2016 demonstrating ESBL prevalence rates of 1.5, 34.5, 31.2, and 35.0% respectively. No difference was observed in overall enterotoxin characterization between the total ETEC and ESBL-positive populations. The CFs CS2 (13.6%), CS3 (25.3%), CS6 (30.2%), and CS21 (62.6%) were the most prevalent in the total ETEC population. The ESBL-positive ETEC isolates exhibited a higher association trend with the CFs CS2 (37.5%), CS3 (35%), CS6 (42.5%), and CS21 (67.5%). The primary ESBL gene identified was bla CTX-M-15 (80%), followed by bla SHV-12 (20%) and bla CTX-M-14 (2.5%). The beta-lactamase genes bla TEM-1 (40%) and bla CMY-2 (2.5%) were also identified. It was determined that 42.5% of the ESBL-positive isolates carried multiple resistance genes. Conclusion: Over 30% of ETEC isolates collected post-2013 and evaluated in this study demonstrated ESBL resistance. Persistent surveillance and characterization of enteric ETEC isolates are vital for tracking the community presence of MDR bacterial species in order to recommend effective treatment strategies and help mitigate the spread of resistant pathogens. © 2018 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

In particular, UAVs are used for rescue systems, disaster detection, and military purposes, as well as for leisure and commercial purposes. UAVs that are controlled over networks by ground control stations (GCS) can provide various services with expanded activity area. It is thus of critical importance to investigate the vulnerability of the drone system. In this paper, we focus on UAVs controlled by GCS over networks. We analyze the vulnerability of the micro-air-vehicle communication (MAVLink) protocol, which is one of the most widely adopted communication protocols for GCS-based control of UAVs. Then, by exploiting the vulnerability of the MAVLink protocol, we propose an attack methodology that can disable an ongoing mission of a UAV. Our empirical study confirms that the proposed attack can stop the attacked UAV and disable the mission. © 2018 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, a novel waveform called a random orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (R-OFDM) pair is proposed. The proposed signal exploits ideal orthogonality by randomly selecting different subsets of a full-band OFDM signal. The compressive sensing (CS) technique is applied for HRRP reconstruction due to the sparse property of the proposed waveform. To further utilize the information of different polarization channels, the joint CS reconstruction algorithm called a fully polarization-simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (FP-SOMP) is proposed instead of the single polarization-OMP algorithm by exploiting row-sparsity of different polarization channels. Both numerical simulations and measured unmanned aerial vehicle data experiments demonstrate that the R-OFDM pair and the CS-based FP-SOMP algorithm are qualified for simultaneous polarimetric HRRP reconstruction. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The chip has open chambers in vertically mobile top layers and rotationally mobile bottom layers to exploit surface tension in biochemical solutions, and implements control over fluid motion. To manipulate biomolecules, a vertically mobile tip with a permanent magnet at the top layer performs collection, transport, release, and dispersion of magnetic beads.

This is distinctively different from existing works typically under the assumption of either two-dimensional (2-D) or deterministic trajectories, and particularly interesting to applications such as surveillance and air combat. The key idea is that we geometrically derive the probability distributions of the UAV-to-UAV (U2U) distances which, by exploiting the Jensen's inequality, can be translated to the closed-form bounds for the capacity between UAVs, and between UAVs and ground stations. Another important aspect is that we extrapolate the idea to dense UAV networks, and analyze the impact of network densification, imperfect channel state information, and interference from ground transmitters on the capacity. Corroborated by simulations, our analysis shows that a U2U link with random 2-D trajectories is superior in terms of capacity due to its short average link distance. It is also revealed that a UAV-to-ground link can incur substantially lower capacity than a U2U link even in the case the 3-D coverage of the UAVs is the same, as the result of its longer average link length. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To deal with such problem, we propose a Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning technique that leverages the history of sensor data and control inputs to predict the goal of sensor spoofing attacks, determine which sensors are compromised, and recover the system. We also propose an active exploration framework to improve the convergence rate of the intention inference before reaching undesired states.

This paper proposes COTA, a system to improve speed and reliability of customer support for end users through automated ticket classification and answers selection for support representatives. Two machine learning and natural language processing techniques are demonstrated: one relying on feature engineering (COTA v1) and the other exploiting raw signals through deep learning architectures (COTA v2). COTA v1 employs a new approach that converts the multi-classification task into a ranking problem, demonstrating significantly better performance in the case of thousands of classes. For COTA v2, we propose an Encoder-Combiner-Decoder, a novel deep learning architecture that allows for heterogeneous input and output feature types and injection of prior knowledge through network architecture choices. This paper compares these models and their variants on the task of ticket classification and answer selection, showing model COTA v2 outperforms COTA v1, and analyzes their inner workings and shortcomings. Finally, an A/B test is conducted in a production setting validating the real-world impact of COTA in reducing issue resolution time by 10 percent without reducing customer satisfaction. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic healthcare-associated pathogen with high rates of morbidity and mortality and an extensive range of resistance mechanisms. This study describes the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of P. aeruginosa isolates from patients with bacteraemia submitted by sentinel laboratories in South Africa from 2014 to 2015. Methodology: Organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were done using automated systems. Molecular methods were used to detect common resistance genes and mechanisms. Results: Overall the susceptibility was high for all antibiotics tested with a decrease over the two-year period. There was no change in the MIC50 and MIC90 breakpoints for all antibiotics from 2014 to 2015. The MIC50 was within the susceptible breakpoint range for most antibiotics and the MIC90 was within the susceptible breakpoint range for colistin only. Phenotypically carbapenem non-susceptible isolates harboured the following plasmid-mediated genes: blaVIM (n = 81, 12%) and blaGES (n = 6, 0.9%); blaNDM (n = 4, 0.6%) and blaOXA-48 and variants (n = 3, 0.45%). Porin deletions were observed in one meropenem non-susceptible isolate only, and multi-drug resistance efflux pumps were expressed in the majority of the non-susceptible isolates investigated. BlaVEB-1, blaIMP and blaKPC were not detected. Conclusion: The prevalence of resistance to commonly used antibacterial agents was low for P. aeruginosa isolates and similarly, tested resistance mechanisms were detected in a relatively small proportion of isolates. Findings in this study represent baseline information for understanding antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in P. aeruginosa isolates from blood.

To deal with these challenges, a path planning algorithm that can learn the terrain environment and generate the motion policy to plan an optimal path is developed. A hierarchical structure is adopted for path planning to achieve the optimal result in a global manner, as well as avoid the curse of dimensionality.

"Navy force structure and shipbuilding plans: Background and issues for congress","2018","Defense Economics: Recent Progress and Remaining Challenges","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058321953&partnerID=40&md5=dc4720cf311ab9231dc55baa2b2225bc","The current and planned size and composition of the Navy, the rate of Navy ship procurement, and the prospective affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plans have been oversight matters for the congressional defense committees for many years. The Navy's proposed FY2018 budget, as amended on May 24, 2017, requests the procurement of nine new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, two Virginia-class attack submarines, two DDG-51 class destroyers, two Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs), one TAO-205 class oiler, and one towing, salvage, and rescue ship. On December 15, 2016, the Navy released a new force-structure goal that calls for achieving and maintaining a fleet of 355 ships of certain types and numbers. Key points about this new 355-ship force-level goal include the following: • The 355-ship force-level goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted by the Navy in 2016. The Navy conducts an FSA every few years, as circumstances require, to determine its force-structure goal. • The new 355-ship force-level goal replaces a 308-ship force-level goal that the Navy released in March 2015. The actual size of the Navy in recent years has generally been between 270 and 290 ships. • The figure of 355 ships appears close to an objective of building toward a fleet of 350 ships that was announced by the Trump campaign organization during the 2016 presidential election campaign. The 355-ship goal, however, reflects the national security strategy and national military strategy that were in place in 2016 (i.e., the Obama Administration's national security strategy and national military strategy). • Compared to the previous 308-ship force-level goal, the new 355-ship force-level goal includes 47 additional ships, or about 15% more ships. More than 47 ships, however, would need to be added to the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan to achieve and maintain the Navy's 355-ship fleet, unless the Navy extends the service lives of existing ships beyond currently planned figures and/or reactivates recently retired ships: • CRS estimates that 57 to 67 ships would need to be added to the Navy's FY2017 30-year (FY2017-FY2046) shipbuilding plan to achieve the Navy's 355-ship fleet and maintain it through the end of the 30-year period (i.e., through FY2046). • The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that 73 to 77 ships would need to be added to the Navy's FY2018 30-year (FY2018-FY2047) shipbuilding plan to achieve the Navy's 355-ship fleet and maintain it not only through the end of the 30-year period (i.e., through FY2047), but another 10 years beyond the end of the 30-year period (i.e., through FY2057). • Even with increased shipbuilding rates, achieving certain parts of the 355-ship forcelevel goal could take many years. CBO estimates that the earliest the Navy could achieve all elements of the 355-ship fleet would be 2035. Extending the service lives of existing ships and/or reactivating retired ships could accelerate the attainment of certain parts of the 355-ship force structure. • Procuring the additional ships needed to achieve and maintain the Navy's 355- ship fleet would require several billion dollars per year in additional shipbuilding funds: • CRS estimates that procuring the 57 to 67 ships that would need to be added to the Navy's FY2017 30-year shipbuilding plan to achieve the Navy's 355- ship fleet and maintain it through FY2046 would notionally cost an average of roughly $4.6 billion to $5.1 billion per year in additional shipbuilding funds over the 30- year period, using today's shipbuilding costs. • CBO estimates that procuring the 73 to 77 ships that would need to be added to the Navy's FY2018 30-year shipbuilding plan to achieve the Navy's 355- ship fleet and maintain it through FY2057 would cost, in constant FY2017 dollars, an average of $5.4 billion per year in additional shipbuilding funds over the 30-year period. • The above additional shipbuilding funds are only a fraction of the total costs that would be needed to achieve and maintain the Navy's 355-ship fleet instead of the Navy's previously envisaged 308-ship fleet. CBO estimates that, adding together both shipbuilding costs and ship operation and support (O & S) costs, the Navy's 355-ship fleet would cost an average of about $11 billion to $23 billion more per year in constant FY2017 dollars than the Navy's previously envisaged 308-ship fleet. This figure does not include additional costs for manned aircraft, unmanned systems, and weapons. • If defense spending in coming years is not increased above the caps established in the Budget Control Act of 2011, or BCA (S. 365/P.L. 112-25 of August 2, 2011), as amended, achieving and maintaining a 355-ship fleet could require reducing funding levels for other Department of Defense (DOD) programs. • Navy officials have stated that, in general, the shipbuilding industrial base has the ability to take on the additional shipbuilding work needed to achieve and maintain a 355-ship fleet, and that building toward the 355-ship goal sooner rather than later would be facilitated by ramping up production of existing ship designs rather than developing and then starting production of new designs. • Depending on the number of additional ships per year that might be added to the Navy's shipbuilding effort, building the additional ships that would be needed to achieve and maintain the 355-ship fleet could create thousands of additional manufacturing (and other) jobs at shipyards, associated supplier firms, and elsewhere in the U.S. economy. • Navy officials have indicated that, prior to embarking on a fleet expansion, they would first like to see additional funding provided for overhaul and repair work to improve the readiness of existing Navy ships, particularly conventionally powered surface ships, and for mitigating other shortfalls in Navy readiness. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, the serious interference among UAVs and multiple D2D pairs is more challenging than the terrestrial case because UAVs are changing the networks topology frequently over time. In this paper, the power control optimization is investigated for D2D communications underlaying UAV-assisted access systems, where a UAV-enabled BS serves multiple users, and the remaining users communicate with each other with the assistance of the UAV, also referred to as D2D pairs. With the aim of throughput maximization, we need to address a non-convex optimization. To this end, difference of two convex functions (D.C.) programming is invoked to solve the formulated optimization, which can obtain suboptimal solutions. Considering the UAV's limited energy and low computational capability, we further design a low-complexity power control algorithm by exploiting the Hessian matrix's structure. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms perform quite well for all considered scenarios. Both of them can improve the system throughput dramatically. Moreover, the low-complexity algorithm produces almost the same throughput as the D.C. programming method with much lower computation burden. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, past approaches assume full state measurements or a centralized controller, which is not found in networked LTI systems with subcontrollers. Since generally the entire system is neither controllable nor observable by a single subcontroller, communication of sensor measurements is required to ensure closed-loop stability. The possibility of attacking the communication channel has not been explicitly considered by previous watermarking schemes, and requires a new design. In this paper, we derive a statistical watermarking test that can detect both sensor and communication attacks. A unique (compared to the non-networked case) aspect of the implementing this test is the state-feedback controller must be designed so that the closed-loop system is controllable by each sub-controller, and we provide two approaches to design such a controller using Heymann's lemma and a multi-input generalization of Heymann's lemma. The usefulness of our approach is demonstrated with a simulation of detecting attacks in a platoon of autonomous vehicles. Our test allows each vehicle to independently detect attacks on both the communication channel between vehicles and on the sensor measurements. © 2018 AACC.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To better exploit the potential of these technologies, there is a need to develop more efficient and accessible analysis workflows and focus more efforts on the distinct challenge of mapping submerged vegetation. We present a straightforward workflow developed to monitor emergent and submerged invasive water soldier (Stratiotes aloides) in shallow waters of the Trent-Severn Waterway in Ontario, Canada. The main elements of the workflow are: (1) collection of radiometrically calibrated multispectral imagery including a near-infrared band; (2) multistage segmentation of the imagery involving an initial separation of above-water from submerged features; and (3) automated classification of features with a supervised machine-learning classifier. The approach yielded excellent classification accuracy for emergent features (overall accuracy = 92%; kappa = 88%; water soldier producer's accuracy = 92%; user's accuracy = 91%) and good accuracy for submerged features (overall accuracy = 84%; kappa = 75%; water soldier producer's accuracy = 71%; user's accuracy = 84%). The workflow employs off-the-shelf graphical software tools requiring no programming or coding, and could therefore be used by anyone with basic GIS and image analysis skills for a potentially wide variety of aquatic vegetation monitoring operations. © 2018 by the authors.

On one hand, the UAV charges the depletion ground IoT devices starting initially with those with battery level under a certain threshold. On the other hand, the UAV station collects data from IoT devices that have sufficient energy to transmit their packets, and in the same phase, the UAV exploits the RF signals transmitted by IoT devices to extract and harvest energy. Furthermore, and as the UAV station has a limited coverage time due to its known energy constraint, we investigate in this work the trade- off between both times that the UAV reserves to devices in order to recharge them and to collect data. Numerical results evaluate different metrics of performances in which we examine the added value of UAV with energy harvesting module. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

These systems generate new flight paths over populated areas. While they can improve flight efficiency, the increased noise associated with these novel flight patterns potentially pose serious health threats to the overflown communities. In this case study, we estimated the monetary benefits relative to health losses associated with one significant change in flight patterns at LaGuardia Airport, year-round use of “TNNIS Climb”, which happened in 2012 as a result of flight automation in New York City. Prior to that, the use of the TNNIS Climb was limited to the U.S. Open tennis matches. Methods: We developed a decision-analytic model using Markov health states to compare the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained associated with the limited use of TNNIS (old status quo) and the year-round use of TNNIS (current status quo). The TNNIS Climb increases airplane noise to above 60 decibels (dB) over some of the most densely populated areas of the city. We used this increased exposure to noise as the basis for estimating ground-level health using data from sound monitors. The total costs (including both direct and indirect costs), QALYs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated for the limited versus the year-round use of the TNNIS Climb. Results: The incremental lifetime costs and QALYs per person exposed to noise associated with the limited versus the year-round use of TNNIS was $11,288, and 1.13, respectively. Therefore, the limited use of TNNIS had an ICER of $10,006/QALY gained relative to the year-round of TNNIS. Our analyses were robust to changes in assumptions and data inputs. Conclusions: Despite increases in efficiency, flight automation systems without a careful assessment of noise might generate flight paths over densely populated areas and cause serious health conditions for the overflown communities. © 2018 by the authors.

Embedding computation at the edge of the network allows to reduce the overall latency compared to vehicle-to-cloud and significantly trim the complexity of vehicle-to-vehicle communication. To demonstrate the efficiency of our solution, we apply these principles on an augmented reality head-up display.

This becomes more prominent when the user crowd moves dynamically in space creating a sporadic usage pattern like in universities, conference halls, disaster scenarios and so on. In such situation, there arises need for the efficient usage of WiFi channels so as to avoid the signal interference among devices and maintain the Quality of Service. It becomes essential to find a mechanism that caters for the dynamically changing demands by identifying areas with high spectrum usage and thus providing better WiFi coverage. The concept of floating access points play a key role in this domain whereby Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) acting as APs can move around to cover the hot zones and solve the problem of network congestion in those zones. Floating AP is one of the numerous applications that UAVs can offer and it addresses a very important issue of load balancing among the access points. As much as this concept is novel and appealing, it is of prime importance to analyze the feasibility of its deployment and operation which is what we are trying to achieve through this paper. Before launching these mobile APs, we aim to understand the dynamic spectrum usage over space, time and channels. The temporal and spatial analysis helps us to identify places that are highly congested at any given time. The channel usage pattern determines channels that are over utilized and under utilized in the congested areas. The sudden spike in the network usage also lets us detect any malicious activities going around and thus preventing the risk of getting attacked. Our goal is to use this information to deploy the floating APs during appropriate times into the congested locations and dynamically reconfigure the deployed floating APs so as to evenly distribute load across all available WiFi channels. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Once detected, the VSI team verifies the signals and issues early warning reports to French animal health authorities when potential threats to France are detected. To improve detection of signals from online news sources, we designed the Platform for Automated extraction of Disease Information from the web (PADI-web). PADI-web automatically collects, processes and extracts English-language epidemiological information from Google News. The core component of PADI-web is a combined information extraction (IE) method founded on rule-based systems and data mining techniques. The IE approach allows extraction of key information on diseases, locations, dates, hosts and the number of cases mentioned in the news. We evaluated the combined method for IE on a dataset of 352 disease-related news reports mentioning the diseases involved, locations, dates, hosts and the number of cases. The combined method for IE accurately identified (F-score) 95% of the diseases and hosts, respectively, 85% of the number of cases, 83% of dates and 80% of locations from the disease-related news. We assessed the sensitivity of PADI-web to detect primary outbreaks of four emerging animal infectious diseases notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). From January to June 2016, PADI-web detected signals for 64% of all primary outbreaks of African swine fever, 53% of avian influenza, 25% of bluetongue and 19% of foot- and-mouth disease.

However, it is difficult to achieve high fidelity and smoothness at the same time by using a single navigation approach. Moreover, the state-of-the-art integrated navigation approach mostly exploits Kalman filter, which depends heavily on the accurate positioning results of GNSS. To find a feasible alternative, an integrated navigation approach based on optimal motion trajectory matching is proposed in this paper. The motion trajectory matching is based on an optimization framework, which minimizes the deviation of the raw positioning results between the inertial navigation system and global positioning system. For verification, experiments are carried out in the environment with bad positioning conditions due to tall buildings and woods blocking effects.

The UAV employs the radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) to charge the users in the downlink, and the users use the harvested RF energy to send independent information to the UAV in the uplink. Unlike the conventional WPCN with fixed APs, the UAV-enabled WPCN can exploit the mobility of the UAV via periodic trajectory design, jointly with the transmission resource allocation optimization, to improve the system performance. In particular, we aim to maximize the uplink common (minimum) throughput among all ground users over a finite UAV's flight period, subject to its maximum speed constraint and the users' energy neutrality constraints. The resulting problem is non-convex and thus difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this challenge, we first consider an ideal case without the maximum UAV speed constraint, and obtain the optimal solution to the relaxed problem. The optimal solution shows that the UAV should successively hover above a finite number of ground locations for downlink WPT, as well as above each of the ground users for uplink communication. Next, based on the above multi-location-hovering solution, we propose a successive hover-and-fly trajectory, jointly with the downlink and uplink power allocations, to find an efficient suboptimal solution to the problem with the maximum UAV speed constraint. Numerical results show that the proposed UAV-enabled WPCN achieves significant common throughput gain over the conventional WPCN with a fixed-location AP. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Assessing the role of UAVs in swarming air combat system, as well as analyzing corresponding combat factors is a crucial part in weapon development evaluation and military equipment system construction. System Dynamics (SD) theory is a good method to study the defense system by analyzing the feedbacks of the battle, but at present the application of SD theory in defense is limited. This paper established a SD model by dividing the attack weapons into Red and Blue army for swarming UAVs air combat system to simulate the combat process. Taking the characteristics of swarming UAVs into consideration and drawing lessons to the concept of Lanchester equation and operational loop, the causality diagrams and the stock-flow chart are constructed in the SD model. The simulation results reflect that the UAVs play an important role and can share the responsibility of high-value weapons in the air combat system.

In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based summarization method that takes advantage of the domain-specific knowledge and a well-established data mining technique called frequent itemset mining. Methods: Our summarizer exploits the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to construct a concept-based model of the source document and mapping the document to the concepts. Then, it discovers frequent itemsets to take the correlations among multiple concepts into account. The method uses these correlations to propose a similarity function based on which a represented graph is constructed. The summarizer then employs a minimum spanning tree based clustering algorithm to discover various subthemes of the document. Eventually, it generates the final summary by selecting the most informative and relative sentences from all subthemes within the text. Results: We perform an automatic evaluation over a large number of summaries using the Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metrics. The results demonstrate that the proposed summarization system outperforms various baselines and benchmark approaches. Conclusion: The carried out research suggests that the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge and frequent itemset mining equips the summarization system in a better way to address the informativeness measurement of the sentences. Moreover, clustering the graph nodes (sentences) can enable the summarizer to target different main subthemes of a source document efficiently. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of the summarization systems in the biomedical domain. © 2018","Article","Final","Scopus"

Automatically identified borders were efficiently adjudicated using our “just-enough-interaction” graph-based segmentation approach that allows to efficiently correct local and regional segmentation errors without slice-by-slice retracing of borders. Results: A total of 50 patients with paired baseline and follow-up OCT studies were included. After registration of baseline and follow-up pullbacks, a total of 356 ± 89 frames were analyzed per patient. During the first post-transplant year, significant reduction in the mean luminal area (p = 0.028) and progression in mean intimal thickness (p = 0.001) were observed. Proximal parts of imaged coronary arteries were affected more than distal parts (p < 0.001). High levels of LDL cholesterol (p = 0.02) and total cholesterol (p = 0.031) in the first month after HTx were the main factors associated with early CAV development. Conclusions: Our novel, highly automated 3D OCT image analysis method for analyzing intimal and medial thickness in HTx recipients provides fast, accurate, and highly detailed quantitative data on early CAV changes, which are characterized by significant luminal reduction and intimal thickness progression as early as within the first 12 months after HTx. © 2018 International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation","Article","Final","Scopus"

One potential area is the rapid proliferation and sophistication of automated and remote systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs are already used to deliver blood to remote military locations in Afghanistan and defibrillators to those that need them in the USA and Sweden. An area of future opportunity would be to facilitate rapid evacuation of wounded personnel from high intensity, high threat, remote and austere areas directly to specialist care. Such a capability would reduce threat to human life while allowing rapid extraction of casualties from high risk or inaccessible environments straight back to Role 3 care, all of which in these situations is either not possible or carries too much risk using conventional aerial assets. The article aims to highlight a potential future capability, stimulate debate and reflection, all of which is essential for innovation and future organisational development. The potential uses and benefits of UAVs are highlighted including both the challenges and rewards of utilising UAVs for casualty evacuation. Key benefits are reduced risk to human life, cost, ability to insert into areas conventional aircraft cannot and the rapidity of transfer. Challenges are likely to be airspace management, decisions on appropriate level of care to deliver during transit and ultimately user acceptability. The article also highlights that in order to maximise our ability to exploit new technologies, all arms and trades within the military must be involved in collective research and development. Furthermore, sensible corroboration with private companies will further enhance our ability to acquire products that best serve our needs. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

Cross-arranged 8-way ultrasonic sensors were used to detect the boundaries of the ridge road and obstacles on the ridge road. The same obstacle matching, obstacle type criterion and trajectory prediction model of dynamic obstacle were put forward. The AGV lateral position deviation and heading deviation angle were used as inputs of fuzzy controller to obtain expected guidance angle of AGV front wheel, which provided a referenced heading angle for wheeled AGV to bypass obstacles. Based on the rolling optimization principle, the obstacle avoidance navigation strategies of adjusting heading deviation angle and vehicle speed were proposed, and the AGV navigation algorithm of bypassing static obstacles, avoiding dynamic obstacles by deceleration or parking of AGV were designed. The software of LabVIEW was used to develop the obstacle avoidance navigation algorithm program, and navigation data was sent to the PLC to control AGV steering in real-time. Simulation experiments showed that the navigation algorithm can make the AGV track with the mode of deviation rectification along preset path of ridge road, which can guide the AGV to avoid collision with obstacles on the ridge road, which verified the effectiveness of the navigation algorithms.

Dynamic soaring for UAVs have mostly been confined in literature to fixed configurations. In order to analyze the extent to which dynamic soaring is influenced by different morphologies, an innovative concept of integrating dynamic soaring with morphing capabilities is introduced. Moreover, optimal soaring trajectories are generated for two basic wing morphologies: variable sweep and variable span. Three-dimensional point-mass UAV equations of motion and nonlinear wind gradient profile are used to model the flight dynamics. Parametric characterization of the key performance parameters is performed to determine the optimal platform configuration during various phases of the maneuver. Results presented in this paper indicate 15% lesser required wind shear by the proposed span morphology and 14% lesser required wind shear by the proposed sweep morphology, in comparison to their respective fixed wing counterparts. This shows that the morphing UAV can perform dynamic soaring in an environment, where fixed configuration UAVs might not, because of lesser available wind shears. Apart from this, span morphology reduced drag by 15%, lift requirement by 11% and angle of attack requirement by 20%, whereas increased the maximum velocity by 6.2%, normalized energies by 9% and improved loitering parameters (approximately 10%), in comparison to fixed span configurations. Similarly, sweep morphology guaranteed 20% drag reduction, 16% lesser angle of attack requirement and improved loitering performance over the fixed sweep configurations. The results achieved from this study strongly support the idea of integrating dynamic soaring with morphing capabilities and its potential benefits. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","Article","Final","Scopus"

Myocardial Infarction also termed as heart attack, happens when the flow of blood decreases or ceases to the heart or a part of it, causing trauma to the muscles of the heart. Early diagnosis of heart attack, getting immediate medical help with remote monitoring and end user notification is aimed in this paper. Broad pathological Q- wave, inversion of T- wave, elevated ST-segment in electrocardiogram (ECG) are the predominant features that must be taken into consideration while foretelling MI. Morphological changes namely ST-segment diversion and T-wave changes are inspected for any potential threat of MI. This paper suggests a novel approach in identifying the variation in ST segment by Wavelet transform, gradient decent methods, and some custom algorithms. Wavelet transform of the live ECG signals obtained from these leads disintegrates recorded wave into sub-bands of different order. Wavelet transform is an efficient method in capturing time and frequency simultaneously. Baseline wandering reduction, denoising and filtering of the live ECG and detection of PQRST positions on the ECG is executed primarily. Identification of various segments namely ST, PT, PQ etc. and implementing various algorithms for any anomalies in ST-segment which deviates beyond a threshold with reference to the normal sinus rhythm is noticed.

Each AUV has to localise and track targets (submarines) robustly and precisely. This can be realised by a bistatic sonar configuration. The precise knowledge of the bistatic system parameters is mandatory for target tracking. These are in particular the positions of the acoustic sources, transmission times, and the position and heading of the AUV sonar sensor. However, these parameters often are not precisely known, e.g. for non-cooperative acoustic sources or due to navigation uncertainties of the AUV. Therefore, the authors consider the inverse problem, i.e. they estimate the bistatic system parameters by exploiting sonar echoes from known stationary 'targets' like wrecks or small islands. Their implementation of the estimation method is based on the multihypothesis tracking technique. Results are discussed for two applications: The first one is estimation of the parameters of a non-cooperative source. The second application focuses on the estimation of the receiver parameters; in particular they show that their approach can be used to increase robustness of AUV navigation.

In this paper, an Electricity Market Model with Electric Vehicles (EMMEV) was developed, exploiting an agent-based model that analyzes how carbon reduction policy in transportation may increase the number of Electric Vehicles and how that would influence electricity price. Agents are Energy Service Providers (ESCOs) which can distribute fuels and their objective is to maximize their profit. In this paper, the EMMEV is used to analyze the impacts of the Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), a performance-based policy instrument, on electricity prices and EV sales volume. The agents in EMMEV are regulated parties in LCFS should meet a certain Carbon Intensity (CI) target for their distributed fuel. In case they cannot meet the target, they should buy credits to compensate for their shortfall and if they exceed it, they can sell their excess. The results, considering the assumptions and limitations of the model, show that the banking strategy of the agents contributing in the LCFS might have negative impact on penetration of EVs, unless there is a regular Credit Clearance to trade credits.

Supervised classification methods can be exploited to translate the UAV data into such basemaps. However, these methods require labeled training samples, the collection of which may be complex and time consuming. Existing spatial datasets can be exploited to provide the training labels, but these often contain errors due to differences in the date or resolution of the dataset from which these outdated labels were obtained. In this paper, we propose an approach for updating basemaps using global and local contextual cues to automatically remove unreliable samples from the training set, and thereby, improve the classification accuracy. Using UAV datasets over Kigali, Rwanda, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, we demonstrate how the amount of mislabeled training samples can be reduced by 44.1% and 35.5%, respectively, leading to a classification accuracy of 92.1% in Kigali and 91.3% in Dar es Salaam. To achieve the same accuracy in Dar es Salaam, between 50000 and 60000 manually labeled image segments would be needed.

In friendly jamming confidential information is obscured from eavesdroppers through the use of opportunistic jamming on the part of the parties engaged in communication. Secure location verification enables the infrastructure in an ITS to verify the position claims of a vehicle in an adversarial setting. We present a method for effectively using friendly jamming and distance bounding together to verify the location and velocity of vehicles, and detect any deviation of claims by a 'prover' vehicle that is trying to prove its position and velocity to the infrastructure. The technique can be used to verify velocity and position claim of a vehicle, while keeping the feasible velocity and position lie by an attacker in a negligible range.

This scenario aligns with the secure deployment of body area networks, IoT, medical devices, industrial automation sensors, autonomous vehicles, and others. We develop VERSE, a physical-layer group message integrity verification primitive that effectively detects advanced wireless signal manipulations that can be used to launch man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks over wireless. Without using shared secrets to establish authenticated channels, such attacks are notoriously difficult to thwart and can undermine the authentication and key establishment processes. VERSE exploits the existence of multiple devices to verify the integrity of the messages exchanged within the group. We then use VERSE to build a bootstrapping protocol, which securely introduces new devices to the network. Compared to the state-of-the-art, VERSE achieves in-band message integrity verification during secure pairing using only the RF modality without relying on out-of-band channels or extensive human involvement. It guarantees security even when the adversary is capable of fully controlling the wireless channel by annihilating and injecting wireless signals. We study the limits of such advanced wireless attacks and prove that the introduction of multiple legitimate devices can be leveraged to increase the security of the pairing process. We validate our claims via theoretical analysis and extensive experimentations on the USRP platform. We further discuss various implementation aspects such as the effect of time synchronization between devices and the effects of multipath and interference.

We restrict to well-formed Jinja bytecode programs that only make use of non-recursive methods. The analysis can handle programs with cyclic data only if the termination behaviour is independent thereof. We exploit a term-based abstraction of programs within the abstract interpretation framework. The proposed transformation encompasses two stages. For the first stage we perform a combined control and data flow analysis by evaluating program states symbolically, which is shown to yield a finite representation of all execution paths of the given program through a graph, dubbed computation graph. In the second stage we encode the (finite) computation graph as a term rewrite system. This is done while carefully analysing complexity preservation and reflection of the employed transformations such that the complexity of the obtained term rewrite system reflects on the complexity of the initial program.

We investigate how the UAV should optimally exploit its mobility via trajectory design to maximize the amount of energy transferred to all ERs during a finite charging period. First, we consider the maximization of the sum energy received by all ERs by optimizing the UAV's trajectory subject to its maximum speed constraint. Although this problem is non-convex, we obtain its optimal solution, which shows that the UAV should hover at one single fixed location during the whole charging period. However, the sum-energy maximization incurs a 'near-far' fairness issue, where the received energy by the ERs varies significantly with their distances to the UAV's optimal hovering location. To overcome this issue, we consider a different problem to maximize the minimum received energy among all ERs, which, however, is more challenging to solve than the sum-energy maximization. To tackle this problem, we first consider an ideal case by ignoring the UAV's maximum speed constraint, and show that the relaxed problem can be optimally solved via the Lagrange dual method. The obtained trajectory solution implies that the UAV should hover over a set of fixed locations with optimal hovering time allocations among them. Then, for the general case with the UAV's maximum speed constraint considered, we propose a new successive hover-and-fly trajectory motivated by the optimal trajectory in the ideal case and obtain efficient trajectory designs by applying the successive convex programing optimization technique. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed designs under different setups, as compared with benchmark schemes. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

We introduce a new method to perform accurate SOC estimation for Li-ion batteries using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM). We showcase the LSTM-RNN's ability to encode dependencies in time and accurately estimate SOC without using any battery models, filters, or inference systems like Kalman filters. In addition, this machine-learning technique, like all others, is capable of generalizing the abstractions it learns during training to other datasets taken under different conditions. Therefore, we exploit this feature by training an LSTM-RNN model over datasets recorded at various ambient temperatures, leading to a single network that can properly estimate SOC at different ambient temperature conditions. The LSTM-RNN achieves a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.573% at a fixed ambient temperature and an MAE of 1.606% on a dataset with ambient temperature increasing from 10 to 25 °C. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

On the other hand, as the most popular mobile platform, Android also attracts lots of attackers' attention. As a result, more and more Android malicious apps appear in the wild, which poses a serious threat to user's security and privacy. To such massive volume of Android malware, automated UI testing techniques have become the mainstream solutions because of the detection efficiency and accuracy. However, all existing UI testing techniques treat the Activity as the basic unit of UI interactions and cannot carry out a fine-grained analysis for Fragments. Due to the lack of Fragment-level analysis, the path coverage is usually quite limited. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose FragDroid, a novel automated UI testing framework supporting both Activity and Fragment analysis. To achieve the Fragment-level testing, we design the Activity & Fragment Transition Model (AFTM) to simulate the internal interactions of an app, and ATFM could be utilized to generate test cases automatically through UI interactions. With the assist of AFTM, FragDroid achieves accessing most Activities and Fragments contained in the app along with the capability of detecting arbitrary API calls. We implemented a prototype of FragDroid and evaluated it on 15 popular apps. The results show FragDroid successfully covered 66% Fragments and the corresponding API calls of testing apps. Also, the traditional approaches have to miss at least 9.6% of API calls invoked in Fragments. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, there are also complicated aerodynamic coupling effects in a BWB UAV and nonlinear interferences between its multiple control effectors. These uncertainties pose great challenges to the flight control. Traditional gain scheduling control law and simple linear combination allocation of multiple control effectors fail to provide satisfactory performance confronting the above challenges. In this paper, an incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion based control allocation (INDICA) approach is implemented to a BWB UAV for the purpose of improving the robustness of the control system and exerting the full effectiveness of redundant control effectors. This approach is embedded in a dual-looped attitude control law, exploiting time scale separation principle. The control effectors are allocated efficiently based on a re-distributed pseudo-inverse algorithm in an incremental form, where the actuator limits and nonlinear axis-coupling effects of multiple effectors are taken into account. A fault reconstruction strategy for control effectors is also designed based on the INDICA. The results show that the INDICA controller follows the attitude command accurately while reducing the dependence on model accuracy.

This is a challenging scenario due to the existence of multiple, large, and independently moving objects in the environment, which often leads to an excessive portion of outliers and results in erroneous motion estimation. Existing algorithms cannot cope with such situations well. This paper proposes a new algorithm for relative pose estimation using a multi-camera system with multiple non-overlapping cameras. The method works robustly even when the number of outliers is overwhelming. By exploiting specific prior knowledge of the autonomous driving scene, we have developed an efficient 4-point algorithm for multi-camera relative pose estimation, which admits analytic solutions by solving a polynomial root-finding equation, and runs extremely fast (at about 0.5 μs per root). When the solver is used in combination with a new random sample consensus sampling scheme by exploiting the conjugate motion constraint, we are able to quickly prune unpromising hypotheses and significantly improve the chance of finding inliers. Experiments on synthetic data have validated the performance of the proposed algorithm. Tests on real data further confirm the method's practical relevance. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It has two unique attributes namely integrity and diversity. But most of the previous studies on automated MI diagnosis algorithm didn't utilize these two attributes simultaneously. In this paper, a novel Multiple-Feature-Branch Convolutional Neural Network (MFB-CNN) is proposed for automated MI detection and localization using ECG. Each independent feature branch of the MFB-CNN corresponds to a certain lead. Individual features of a lead can be learned by a feature branch, exploiting the diversity among the 12 leads. Global fully-connected softmax layer can exploit the integrity, summarizing all the feature branches. Based on deep learning framework, no hand-designed features are required for analysis. Furthermore, patient-specific paradigm is adopted to manage the inter-patient variability, which is a significant challenge for automated diagnosis. Also, class-based experiment (regardless of the inter-patient variability) is performed. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the ECG data from PTB diagnostic database. It can achieve a good performance in MI diagnosis. For class-based MI detection and localization, the average accuracies are up to 99.95% and 99.81%, respectively; for patient-specific experiment, the average accuracies of MI detection and localization are 98.79% and 94.82%, respectively.

We aim to characterize the capacity region of this new type of BC over a given UAV flight duration, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and transmit power/rate allocations over time, subject to the UAV's maximum speed and maximum transmit power constraints.

Any delay in intervention during an emergency often culminates into a poor outcome. Early electrical defibrillation is one of the most important interventions in patients with cardiac arrest. This study aimed to conduct a clinical audit of defibrillator devices at an urban public sector hospital in Johannesburg. Methods All defibrillator devices within various areas of the hospital were assessed. Device characteristics were recorded into a data collection sheet and subjected to further analysis. Results This study assessed 112 out of 123 areas in the hospital with a total of 143 defibrillators comprising 139(97.2%) manual external defibrillators (MED) and four(2.8%) automated external defibrillators (AED). MEDs were located in the general wards (n=52, 37.4%), theatre complex (n=25, 17.9%), high dependency areas (n=27, 19.4%) and non-sleepover areas (n=35, 25.2%).

The overall system is uncertain and has independent subsystem dynamics but coupling objectives and state constraints. Waterborne AGVs determine their actions in a parallel way, while still minimizing an overall cost function and respecting coupling constraints robustly by communicating within a neighborhood. Our first contribution is the proposal of the system robustness level for the cost-effective robust distributed model predictive control (RDMPC) for waterborne AGVs. Cost-effective RDMPC models the price of robustness by explicitly considering uncertainty and system characteristics in a tube-based robust control framework. The second contribution is an efficient integrated branch bound (BB) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) algorithm for solving the cost-effective RDMPC problem. The algorithm exploits special ordered variable sets and combining branching criteria with intermediate ADMM results conducting smart search in BB. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for cooperative distributed waterborne AGVs with cost-effective robustness. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Most people would say it looks just like a turtle, but an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that can normally recognize turtles saw it differently. Most of the time, it thought the turtle was a rifle. Similarly, it saw a 3D-printed baseball as an espresso. These are examples of ""adversarial attacks""—subtly altered images, objects, or sounds that fool AIs without setting off human alarm bells. Impressive advances in AI—particularly machine learning algorithms that can recognize sounds or objects after digesting vast training data sets—have spurred the growth of living room voice assistants and autonomous cars. But these AIs are surprisingly vulnerable to being spoofed. At the ICML meeting, adversarial attacks were a hot subject, with researchers reporting novel ways to trick AIs as well as new ways to defend them. Somewhat ominously, one of the conference's two best paper awards went to a study suggesting protected AIs aren't as secure as their developers might think. © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved.","Article","Final","Scopus"

A conceptual framework defining the vehicle lane positioning on an arbitrary road network is introduced. The proposed model-based feedback scheme, receiving as main inputs a recent observation set and the current vehicle state, returns the vehicle level lane position. Various decision-making criteria are conceived each is associated with low algorithmic complexity and thus reduced computational cost. A prioritization criteria policy is defined selecting the most appropriate constraints to be satisfied at each decision time. Since a minimum number of trustworthy, sensor available information is exploited the need for additional, costly devices is substantially decreased. Depending upon the reference vehicle context and data reliability no solution or even multiple responses may be implied in which case the more reliable answer should be selected. Alternatives to compensate the case of no lane identification are proposed. The algorithm performance is evaluated and its effectiveness is illustrated in both qualitative and quantitative terms. Complex ground truth are utilized incorporating multiple traffic conditions and types of road infrastructure. Metrics on the correctness and precision of the suggested scheme, estimation failure, entry validation etc. are presented. © 2018 AACC.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To further increase the network interoperability, many emerging network protocols, such as opportunistic mobile network routing protocols, integrated social network into communication network through utilizing social mobility and opportunistic carry and forward routing algorithms. However, in practical harsh environment such as a battlefield, the uncertainty of social mobility and complexity of vulnerable environment due to unpredictable physical and cyber attacks from enemy, would seriously affect the effectiveness and practicality of these emerging network protocols. This paper proposes a GT-SaRE-MANET (Game Theoretic Situation-aware Robot Enhanced Mobile Ad-hoc Network)routing protocol that adopt the online game theoretic reinforcement learning technique to design the mobility of multi-robot as well as handle the uncertainty and potential physical and cyber attack at tactical edge. Firstly, a set of game theoretic mission oriented metrics has been introduced to describe the interrelation among network quality, multi-robot mobility as well as potential attacking activities. Then, a distributed multi-agent game theoretic reinforcement learning algorithm has been developed. It will not only optimize GT-SaRE-MANET routing protocol and the mobility of multi-robots online, but also effectively avoid the physical and/or cyber attacks from enemy by using the game theoretic mission oriented metrics. The effectiveness of proposed design has been demonstrated through computer aided simulation and hardware experiments. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The commoditization of hardware has reduced unit costs, thereby lowering the barriers to entry to the field of aerial swarm robotics. A key enabling technology for swarms is the family of algorithms that allow the individual members of the swarm to communicate and allocate tasks amongst themselves, plan their trajectories, and coordinate their flight in such a way that the overall objectives of the swarm are achieved efficiently. These algorithms, often organized in a hierarchical fashion, endow the swarm with autonomy at every level, and the role of a human operator can be reduced, in principle, to interactions at a higher level without direct intervention. This technology depends on the clever and innovative application of theoretical tools from control and estimation. This paper reviews the state of the art of these theoretical tools, specifically focusing on how they have been developed for, and applied to, aerial swarms. Aerial swarms differ from swarms of ground-based vehicles in two respects: they operate in a three-dimensional space and the dynamics of individual vehicles adds an extra layer of complexity. We review dynamic modeling and conditions for stability and controllability that are essential in order to achieve cooperative flight and distributed sensing. The main sections of this paper focus on major results covering trajectory generation, task allocation, adversarial control, distributed sensing, monitoring, and mapping. Wherever possible, we indicate how the physics and subsystem technologies of aerial robots are brought to bear on these individual areas. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Most of the existing authentication schemes consider single-server environments and require multiple registrations of the same user for multiple servers. Moreover, most of these schemes do not consider biometric template revocation and error correction for noisy biometric signals. In addition, the existing schemes have several weaknesses, including stolen smart card attack, lack of user anonymity, user impersonation attack, and non-diversification of biometric data. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a new three-factor authenticated key agreement scheme using a fuzzy commitment approach. The three factors used in the proposed scheme are the user's password, smart card, and personal biometrics. The security of the proposed scheme is verified using a formal security analysis under the broadly accepted Real-Or-Random model for the session key security. The widely accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic is also applied for mutual authentication between a legally registered user and a server, and formal security verification using the broadly accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications is performed for the proposed scheme through simulation to show that it is secure. In addition, the informal security analysis of the proposed scheme shows that the scheme can resist other known attacks. Finally, a comparative study of the proposed scheme with the existing related schemes is conducted to measure the tradeoff among the security and functionality features and the communication and computation costs. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

One of the important factors affecting lift on the wing is the aspect ratio of the wing. The theory shows that the use of wings with infinite span length (infinite wing) is the most ideal wing design, but in fact it is impossible to make wings of infinite length. Therefore the wing's length is limited and made with dimensions proportional to the fuselage length of the aircraft. The span length of the aircraft is limited, making a three-dimensional separation on the wing tip section which will form a secondary flow, where this flow gives loss on the performance of the aircraft as it reduces the effective area of the wing and increase the wing drag. One modification on the aircraft wing to reduce the impact of the vortex tip is the use of the winglet on the tip portion of the wing. This has been widely applied to the latest commercial aircraft to improve the efficiency of the aircraft and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). The study using numerical simulation was done with simulation software with 3D geometric configuration. The geometry of the model is UAV wing Eppler 562 with chord length of 0.36 m, swept angle 0°and modification of whitcomb winglet with cant angle 90°. The was performed at inlet airflow of 10 m / s and the pressure at the outlet was 0 Pa (gage). The turbulent modeling used is k-ω SST. Discrete method is hybrid mesh with boundary layer mesh method. The results of flow visualization show that withcomb winglet can improve wing performance effectively at high angles of attack, especially at angle α = 8°and α = 10°, which CL/CD higher than airfoil without winglet.

All such online services are provided remotely facilitating the users to freely move any where with out disruption of the services. In order to ensure seamless and secure services to the remote user such services espouse authentication protocols. A number of authentication protocols are readily available to achieve security and privacy in remote client server architecture. Most of these schemes are tailored for single server architecture. In such scenario, if a user wants to attain the services provided by more than one servers he has to register with each server. In recent times, multiserver authentication has got much attention, where a user can register once and then can acquire services provided by multiple servers. Very recently, Lu et al. proposed a biometric, smart card and password-based three factor authentication scheme usable for multiserver environments. Furthermore, Lu et al. identified their scheme to resist known attacks. However, the analysis in this paper ascertains that Lu et al.’s scheme is vulnerable to impersonation attack. An adversary registered to the system just after knowing the public identity of a user can impersonate himself as the latter. Then we propose an improvement over Lu et al.’s scheme. Our improvement is more robust than the existing schemes. The security of proposed scheme is substantiated formally along with informal security discussion, while same is also validated using a popular automated tool ProVerif. The analysis confirms that proposed scheme achieves mutual authentication and is robust against known attacks.

The conceptual AUV generates energy while anchored, and can relocate itself when needed. In order to maintain an estimate of the Gulf Stream flow profile that can be referenced for control, an estimator blends a measurement of the flow speed at the AUV's location with intermittent secondary flow speed data (which is available through a High Frequency Radar Network (HFRNet)). Model predictive control (MPC)-based spatiotemporal optimization is then used to optimize the location of the AUV along a cross-stream transect whose velocity profile varies as a function of time and cross-stream location. The proposed MPC strategy is structured in a way that the need for instantaneous power maximization (termed exploitation) is balanced with the need to maintain an accurate map of ocean current speed versus location on transect (termed exploration). The control strategy is validated through data from a numerical model of coastal circulation dynamics. © 2018 AACC.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In particular, one of the most prominent 5G use cases is represented by the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) context, which aims to enhance people's driving experience with collective safety and infotainment applications (e.g., autonomous driving, driver assistance, and contextual information). To achieve the requirements of better reliability, lower latency, and higher data rate, the use of extremely high frequencies (known as millimeter-wave, mmWave) is envisioned as an efficient solution. In fact, very high numbers of sensors deployed on vehicles introduce a serious challenge for the initial access procedure due to likely collisions in case of massive connection attempts. For that reason, the goal of this work is to offer improvements to the reliability of the initial access procedure for 5G mmWave cellular in massive V2X communications scenarios. In doing so, we propose to exploit redundant preamble transmissions in order to faster acquire a data transmission opportunity. Our obtained results indicate that by sending multiple replicas of a random access preamble the success probability to transmit at the first attempt is at least twice higher than that with the legacy approaches where a single random access preamble is being sent. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The registration process in most targeted biopsy systems today relies heavily on accurate segmentation of ultrasound images. Automatic or semi-automatic segmentation is typically performed offline prior to the start of the biopsy procedure. In this paper, we present a deep neural network based real-time prostate segmentation technique during the biopsy procedure, hence paving the way for dynamic registration of mp-MRI and ultrasound data. In addition to using convolutional networks for extracting spatial features, the proposed approach employs recurrent networks to exploit the temporal information among a series of ultrasound images. One of the key contributions in the architecture is to use residual convolution in the recurrent networks to improve optimization. We also exploit recurrent connections within and across different layers of the deep networks to maximize the utilization of the temporal information. Furthermore, we perform dense and sparse sampling of the input ultrasound sequence to make the network robust to ultrasound artifacts. Our architecture is trained on 2,238 labeled transrectal ultrasound images, with an additional 637 and 1,017 unseen images used for validation and testing, respectively.

Thereby, no longer individualized robots have to be designed for different tasks. Instead, the system is enabled to adapt its hardware configuration to changing requirements.

Firstly, according to the relative kinematics and dynamics equations of particles, a cooperative interception model is established. Secondly, under the condition that the detection capability of the attacking missile is limited, the cooperative guidance requirement is analyzed and a feasible cooperative guidance scenario is derived. Finally, the cooperative guidance law is designed based on the proportional and differential control method which can achieve the goal of stabilizing the line-of-sight axis and cooperative guidance by modulating the angle between the Detector-to-Missile and Detector-to-Target LOS axis. Mathematical simulations show that when the target performs sinusoidal and uniform acceleration maneuvering, the cooperative guidance law can both ensure that the attacking missile intercepts the target effectively under the guidance of the detector, which confirms the availability and advantage of the cooperative guidance law. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Considering the automotive sector, different Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) use cases have been identified by the industrial and research world, referring to infotainment, automated driving and road safety. A common characteristic of these use cases is the need to exploit collective awareness of the road environment towards satisfying performance requirements. One of these requirements is the End-to-End (E2E) latency when, for instance, Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) inform vehicles about their status (e.g., location) and activity, assisted by the cellular network. In this paper, focusing on a freeway-based VRU scenario, we argue that, in contrast to conventional, remote cloud-based cellular architecture, the deployment of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) infrastructure can substantially prune the E2E communication latency. Our argument is supported by an extensive simulation-based performance comparison between the conventional and the MEC-assisted network architecture. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The significantly increased attention on UAV applications also has led to security concerns particularly in the context of networked UAVs. Networked UAVs are vulnerable to malicious attacks over open-air radio space and accordingly intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been naturally derived to deal with the vulnerabilities and/or attacks. In this paper, we briefly survey the state-of-the-art IDS mechanisms that deal with vulnerabilities and attacks under networked UAV environments. In particular, we classify the existing IDS mechanisms according to information gathering sources, deployment strategies, detection methods, detection states, IDS acknowledgment, and intrusion types.

In this paper, we present a new approach to dynamic collision avoidance for multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A new nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approach is proposed to safely navigate in a workspace populated by static and/or moving obstacles. The uniqueness of our approach lies in its ability to anticipate the dynamics of multiple obstacles, avoiding them in real-time. Exploiting active set algorithms, only the obstacles that affect to the UAV during the prediction horizon are considered at each sample time. We also improve the fluency of avoidance maneuvers by reformulating the obstacles as orientable ellipsoids, being less prone to local minima and allowing the definition of a preferred avoidance direction. Finally, we present two real-time implementations based on simulation. The former demonstrates that our approach outperforms its analog static formulation in terms of safety and efficiency. The latter shows its capability to avoid multiple dynamic obstacles. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

These applications and networks are subject to continuous change. The current separation of design process and operation in the field will be superseded by a life-long design process of adaptation, infield integration, and update. Continuous change and evolution, application interference, environment dynamics and uncertainty lead to complex effects which must be controlled to serve a growing set of platform and application needs. Self-adaptation based on self-awareness and self-configuration has been proposed as a basis for such a continuous in-field process. Research is needed to develop automated in-field design methods and tools with the required safety, availability, and security guarantees. The paper shows two complementary use cases of self-awareness in architectures, methods, and tools for cyber-physical systems. The first use case focuses on safety and availability guarantees in self-aware vehicle platforms. It combines contracting mechanisms, tool based self-analysis and self-configuration. A software architecture and a runtime environment executing these tools and mechanisms autonomously are presented including aspects of self-protection against failures and security threats. The second use case addresses variability and long term evolution in networked MPSoC integrating hardware and software mechanisms of surveillance, monitoring, and continuous adaptation. The approach resembles the logistics and operation principles of manufacturing plants which gave rise to the metaphoric term of an Information Processing Factory that relies on incremental changes and feedback control. Both use cases are investigated by larger research groups. Despite their different approaches, both use cases face similar design and design automation challenges which will be summarized in the end. We will argue that seemingly unrelated research challenges, such as in machine learning and security, could also profit from the methods and superior modeling capabilities of self-aware systems. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

For example, swarming drones might enable more effective CBRN delivery. Or they might facilitate standoff detection, search the oceans for nuclear-armed submarines, or otherwise impede an adversary’s ability to threaten or employ CBRN weapons. Conventionally armed drone swarms might serve as strategic deterrents in lieu of CBRN weapons.

How likely is this volcano to erupt within a certain period? Does a subsurface reservoir contain resources of interest? Background research may reveal the existence of pertinent knowledge and information discovered previously, new data are normally acquired, and an inference problem is solved in order to answer the questions taking both all of the a priori information and the new data into account. Inverse theory, decision theory and the theory of experimental design provide methods to optimize the design of the investigation and to estimate results. However, those theories are normally set in the context of a particular model of the universe, with its particular parametrization. This requires the investigator to specify a priori a coherent utility (a function that describes the risks and rewards) of all possible outcomes under that parametrization. Quite commonly, the investigator may not be able to do this. Ideally an investigator would be able merely to pose a set of questions, define a set of constraints on the data types, acquisition costs and logistics, and provide a functional to relate the questions to any particular parameter space. Theory and methodology would then semi-autonomously drive the interrogation of the state of nature by optimally selecting one or more relevant models and parameter spaces, and designing, acquiring and analysing data, in order to best answer the questions. If necessary this could be done in a sequential or iterative manner, which potentially then involves changing the questions posed in each iteration based on both previous results and inspiration from the investigator. We present such a theory of interrogation in this paper. We review the relevant aspects of decision and design theory, and cast them in a framework where the investigator specifies a utility only at the level required by the general questions to be posed. Each model under consideration is then mapped into this utility space of possible answers. We then extend this framework to sequential investigations, where the outcome of each step may affect all aspects of the problem: the models entertained, the utilities and even the questions themselves. A variety of examples illustrates the generality of this method: an asset team investigating how best to exploit a subsurface reservoir, Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the Bayesian evidence for geophysical models, discriminating between different rock physics models of strain in laboratory deformation experiments, an organization sequentially assessing the effectiveness of its methods to evaluate subsurface assets, assessing whether subsurface CO                             2                              storage should be promoted for climate change mitigation, and examples running through the text of seismic tomography, earthquake characterization and autonomous interplanetary robotic exploration.                          © The Author(s) 2018.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To address the safety issues in autonomous driving systems, a recent set of testing techniques have been designed to automatically generate artificial driving scenes to enrich test suite, e.g., generating new input images transformed from the original ones. However, these techniques are insufficient due to two limitations: first, many such synthetic images often lack diversity of driving scenes, and hence compromise the resulting efficacy and reliability. Second, for machine-learning-based systems, a mismatch between training and application domain can dramatically degrade system accuracy, such that it is necessary to validate inputs for improving system robustness. In this paper, we propose DeepRoad, an unsupervised DNN-based framework for automatically testing the consistency of DNN-based autonomous driving systems and online validation. First, DeepRoad automatically synthesizes large amounts of diverse driving scenes without using image transformation rules (e.g. scale, shear and rotation). In particular, DeepRoad is able to produce driving scenes with various weather conditions (including those with rather extreme conditions) by applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) along with the corresponding real-world weather scenes. Second, DeepRoad utilizes metamorphic testing techniques to check the consistency of such systems using synthetic images. Third, DeepRoad validates input images for DNN-based systems by measuring the distance of the input and training images using their VGGNet features. We implement DeepRoad to test three well-recognized DNN-based autonomous driving systems in Udacity self-driving car challenge. The experimental results demonstrate that DeepRoad can detect thousands of inconsistent behaviors for these systems, and effectively validate input images to potentially enhance the system robustness as well. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this contribution we will focus on the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation, which, while being crucial for environmental perception, still has considerable room for improvement. In particular, we aim to measure the performance of Compressive Sensing (CS) based algorithms applied for reconstruction of the DoA. In contrast to the traditional FFT approach, these algorithms are able to exploit sparse antenna configurations with a reduced number of Tx and Rx channels and a large effective aperture. For this purpose, a series of relevant metrics are defined and applied to measurements in representative open-air driving scenarios acquired with an automotive 4x8 MIMO radar operating at 77GHz.

In this paper, we propose a method for 3D positioning and tracking of moving user equipments (UEs) in 5G mmW networks based on downlink (DL) reference signals (RSs) and maximum ratio combining of subcarriers. In particular, we consider a system in which base stations (BSs) transmit beamformed DL RSs in a periodic manner and UEs exploit such RSs for estimating the BS-UE beam-pair gains by coherently combining all of the available subcarriers. This is achieved by a novel maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for the beam-pair gain. These beam-pair gain estimates are then reported back to the BSs, where they are used to estimate the direction of departure (DoD) of the DL RSs by a novel extended Kalman filter (EKF). The obtained DoD estimates from all available BSs are fused into a UE position estimate in a central unit of the considered network by a second stage EKF. Hence, the computational burden is distributed among different network entities. The proposed positioning algorithm may be implemented with minor modifications to the signalling scheme currently specified for the first phase (Rel. 15) of 3GPP 5G New Radio (NR) system.

Accordingly, the mainstay pharmacotherapy against poisoning by OP comprises the competitive muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist atropine to treat muscarinic effects and, in addition, oximes to reactivate inhibited AChE. A therapeutic gap still remains in the treatment of desensitized nicotinic acetylcholine receptors following OP exposure. Hereby, nicotinic effects result in paralysis of the central and peripheral respiratory system if untreated. Thus, these receptors pose an essential target for therapeutic indication to address these life-threatening nicotinic symptoms of the cholinergic crisis. Identification of ligands regulating dynamic transitions between functional states by binding to modulatory sites appears to be a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention. In this patch clamp study, the ability of differently substituted bispyridinium non-oximes to “resensitize” i.e. to recover the activity of desensitized human homomeric α7-type nAChRs stably transfected in CHO cells was investigated and compared to the already described α7-specific positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596. The structures of these bispyridinium analogues were based on the lead structure of the tert-butyl-substituted bispyridinium propane MB327, which has been shown to have a positive therapeutic effect due to a non-competitive antagonistic action at muscle-type nAChRs in vivo and has been found to have a positive allosteric activity at neuronal receptors in vitro. Prior to test compounds, desensitization of hα7-nAChRs was verified by applying an excess of nicotine revealing activation at low, and desensitization at high concentrations. Thereby, desensitization could be reduced by modulation with PNU-120596. Desensitization was further verified by dose-response profiles of agonists, carbamoylcholine and epibatidine in the absence and presence of PNU-120596. Although less pronounced than PNU-120596 and the lead structure MB327, bispyridinium compounds, particularly those substituted at position 3 and 4, resensitized the nicotine desensitized hα7-nAChRs in a concentration-dependent manner and prolonged the mean channel open time. In summary, identification of more potent compounds able to restore nAChR function in OP intoxication is needed for development of a putative efficient antidote. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This emerging connectivity can potentially create serious security issues where patient privacy can be easily compromised. Protection of patient data from malicious cyber-physical attackers requires radical solutions at the BioMEMS level. Ideally, the information exchange between the patient and practitioner is an automated and transparent process for the patient. In practice, this exchange requires both the patient and the test results to be authenticated and validated respectively on the storage service to ensure that the medical diagnostic results are properly stored and their access is protected. This secure authentication phase is particularly critical for medical diagnostics: patient data exposure could lead to negative social effects. This work focuses on providing a transparent authentication mechanism for patient blood tests performed using impedance flow cytometry. The goal is twofold: first, to alleviate the user from security procedures, precisely an authentication step, while using the medical device; second, to provide a unique identifier for the test results when stored in a remote server. This paper describes a domain specific authentication method for impedance flow cytometry devices. We spike into the blood samples synthetic micro-beads of different sizes, at determined concentrations, to generate a unique authentication string that uniquely identify a test result on the remote storage service. These authentication strings are embedded in the test devices and can be used as a convenient alternative to generic authentication methods, such as logins and passwords. This alternative method removes the authentication burden from the user and protects patient’s privacy further by preventing them from linking their personal information to their test results. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The authors thus propose an automated algorithm to accurately predict the passcode entered by a victim on her smartphone by recording the video.

This is in respect of gaining fast, wide-scale, three-dimensional imaging of the seafloor and its substrate, extracting maximum value from a single, time-limited survey. The combination of these two systems offers good knowledge of both the stratigraphy and the habitat extents on the seabed, aspects often linked to each other. However, a basic drawback is the inconsistency between their mapping scales, as SSS produces high-resolution backscatter maps and SBP produces substrata information of high vertical but very low horizontal density. In this work, 100-kHz SSS and 3.5-kHz SBP data, collected simultaneously during a geophysical survey at a 5.5 × 3.3 km, shallow (10–50 m depth) Marine Protected Area in Lourdas Gulf, Kefalonia Island, Greece, underwent post-processing and analysis, to extract numerous statistical features from both the seafloor and its substrate, towards automated seafloor classification. The SSS mosaic image was subjected to segmentation, coupling the mean-shift algorithm and unsupervised classification. The SBP images were processed using edge enhancement/detection techniques and numerous features were extracted regarding the acoustic appearance, transparency and density of the automatically detected seismic reflectors. Supervised classification of the SBP derivatives exhibited their high discrimination ability between different sea-bed types, making them suitable for ground discrimination. Linking of the SBP classes to the SSS segments (object-based analysis) led to full coverage, high detailed benthic habitat maps. Training of the classifiers was carried out using data points in proximity to underwater video inspected areas, while validation was performed using a manual habitat map made by expert interpreters. Three marine habitat classification schemes have been examined separately, namely NATURA, EUNIS and a custom one, successively including more Habitat types in a hierarchical manner, as to validate the method under different complexity levels. The SSS mosaic, as well as an independent data-set acquired using RoxAnn acoustic ground discrimination system, were also used, each individually, to classify Lourdas Gulf in yet again an object-based manner. The latter showed that SBP derivatives led to an equally significant and in most cases better classification of benthic habitats, compared to those produced by the widely tested and documented SSS and RoxAnn systems, implying that they deserve further exploitation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, to design such a system, several aspects must be considered to make fewer resources required, such as energy efficiency, miniaturization, the required functionality, etc. Conventional methods of data compression and reconstruction fail in energy efficiency. Different from the conventional compression methods, compressive sampling (CS) provides a new perspective to compress huge data with low energy consumption. Unfortunately, the recordings of underwater acoustic signal (UAS) are nonsparse in time domain. Hence, the current CS methods cannot be used directly for compression and reconstruction of UAS. This study adopts the wavelet-Transform-based dictionary matrix to build a framework for sparse representation; then, introduces an approach based on structured approximation $l-0$ (SAL0) norm, which is designed by exploring and exploiting the correlation structure of UAS. The proposed method searches the optimal sparse solution via steepest descent method and then projects the solution to its feasible set. Combing with the compression matrix and dictionary matrix, the estimation of SAL0 method is used for reconstructing nonsparse UAS.

However, the traditional scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) based method often suffers from many mismatches when being utilized to register unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images with obvious rotation, viewpoint change and similar textures. In order to tackle this problem, we formulate the image matching problem as a Markov Random Field (MRF) energy minimization problem and propose an accurate and fast image registration framework. First, a SIFT algorithm is utilized to extract keypoints and an algorithm called “Center of Mass” (CoM) is exploited to assign a single orientation for every point instead of SIFT since SIFT may cause ambiguity in subsequent process; second, based on the local adjacent spatial relationship between a feature point and its neighboring points, a new concept of local spatial constraints is proposed to characterize the geometric consistency between them and incorporated into a belief propagation algorithm to obtain initial matching results; finally the residual mismatches are eliminated by the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, meanwhile the transformation parameters are estimated. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly enhance the registration performance in UAV image registration. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In response, this paper proposes a novel Software Defined Networking (SDN) based Global Access Control (SGAC) to accommodate Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P) communication systems. SGAC is the first attribute-based access control framework for connected vehicle communication based on SDN. SGAC tackles the need in federated vehicular communication to make decisions based on very volatile dynamic information. This SGAC enforces strict rules and dynamic changes based on network activities to yield better consistency and provide information at different levels of abstractions to enable the smooth flow of traffic. In the proposed SGAC, incoming requests are analyzed prior to access decisions, being routed through either centralized or decentralized modes, which gives system administrators flexibility to select the proper choice. We validated the SGAC via a driving simulator in a V2P communication setting. The simulation results showed that the SGAC could effectively control the mean speed throughout the entire work zone area, induce earlier lane changing, and extend stopping distance for worker crossings. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

These vehicles will operate based on the data transmitted over hundreds of sensors. However, an attacker could remotely control a car by intercepting and tampering with these data, and even threaten the life of the driver. In this paper, we propose a code-based authentication scheme that provides both secure booting and lightweight data integrity checking to prevent unauthorized remote control. First, we split some of the core code involved in booting the car, and divide it into several secret pieces known as a share polynomial. One of these is distributed to the driver and is then used to reconstruct the booting code, allowing only the driver with this share polynomial to recover the code and start the car. The remaining share polynomials are distributed to the vehicle control unit and used to generate a lightweight pairwise key. Since the proposed scheme requires only multiplication to generate the pairwise key, it is computationally efficient compared to conventional schemes that require expensive exponential computation. Additional communication is not required to set up the pairwise key, because it needs nothing but the id value of the partner. Thus, our scheme is highly suitable for low-performance devices inside the car. We used the Robot OS system, a widely used autonomous vehicle platform, to implement the proposed scheme and evaluated its feasibility on various test cases. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The objective of this study is to perform general quantitative assessment of various tillage tools’ performance. At the first stage of the study we conducted the generalized assessment of soil tillage systems’ influence on crops’ yielding capacity. The task of the second stage was analysis of the modern tillage tools’ performance from the perspective of capacity of the tractor aggregated with them. The study has not revealed the necessity to refuse from some kind of tillage in favor of another; it has been stated that the most rational is alternation of soil tillage systems for different crops in crop rotation. At the same time, energy-saturated machinery shows the same indicators of specific fuel consumption, operating speed and coefficient of switch-over time utilization as the aggregates with tillage tools of less operating width. The main advantage of the wide-cut aggregates is narrowed to reduction of labor input, the value of which is inversely proportional to the operating width of the applied tool. However, the increase in specific materials consumption of the tools outruns the intensity of their operating width, which causes nonlinear increase in the machinery cost, the degree of its negative impact on the soil, and its more complicated exploitation. These drawbacks are compensated with a series of advantages, first of all, with the decrease in the labor input. In case of introducing driverless tractors the profit from application of the aggregates with increased operating width is to a great extent smoothed over. Therefore, hypothetically the development of site specific crop farming and automation of the agricultural processes will contribute to limitation of tractors capacity and operating width of the tools aggregated with them. © 2018, Gaurav Society of Agricultural Research Information Centre.

The presence of myocardial scar is a strong predictor of ventricular remodeling, cardiac dysfunction and mortality. Our aim was to assess quantitatively the presence of scar tissue from cardiac-magnetic-resonance (CMR) with late-Gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) images using a deep-learning (DL) approach. Methods. Scar segmentation was performed automatically with a DL approach based on ENet, a deep fully-convolutional neural network (FCNN). We investigated three different ENet configurations. The first configuration (C1) exploited ENet to retrieve directly scar segmentation from the CMR-LGE images. The second (C2) and third (C3) configurations performed scar segmentation in the myocardial region, which was previously obtained in a manual or automatic way with a state-of-the-art DL method, respectively. Results. When tested on 250 CMR-LGE images from 30 patients, the best-performing configuration (C2) achieved 97% median accuracy (inter-quartile (IQR) range = 4%) and 71% median Dice similarity coefficient (IQR = 32%).

Each affine model represents a different system operating mode, corresponding to unobserved intents of other drivers or robots, or to fault types or attack strategies, etc. The input design problem aims to find optimal separating/discriminating (controlled) inputs such that the output trajectories of all the affine models are guaranteed to be distinguishable from each other, despite uncertainty in the initial condition and uncontrolled inputs as well as the presence of process and measurement noise. We propose a novel formulation to solve this problem, with an emphasis on guarantees for model discrimination and optimality, in contrast to a previously proposed conservative formulation using robust optimization. This new formulation can be recast as a bilevel optimization problem and further reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Moreover, our fairly general problem setting allows the incorporation of objectives and/or responsibilities among rational agents. For instance, each driver has to obey traffic rules, while simultaneously optimizing for safety, comfort and energy efficiency.

The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop delayed system is hence analytically proven by exploiting the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory. Stability conditions are expressed as a set of Linear Matrix Inequalities, whose solution allows the proper tuning of proportional, derivative and integral gains such as to counteract the presence of the time-varying input delay. An exemplar tracking maneuver is considered for evaluating the performance of a connected vehicles fleet and the numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the theoretical derivation. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

These precise 3D maps are often created using Mobile Mapping System (MMS) instruments equipped with various sensors. Among these sensors, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is the most widely adopted sensor for the generation of 3D maps. This paper describes the intensity calibration process for 3D LiDAR sensors installed on MMS. A typical LiDAR sensor measures the distance to an object in addition to intensity, which is the magnitude of the reflection from the surface of an object. Physically, the value of intensity depends on three factors: reflectance, the distance from the surface, and the angle of incidence. Therefore, the intensity values of road markings with the same reflectance may result in different intensity values depending on distance and angle of incidence. The method proposed in this paper aims to correct the measured intensity value of objects to ensure the measurements of the same object reports the same intensity value. To solve this issue, the intensity characteristic of each sensor with regards to a reference surface was exploited and the reflectance of the surface was estimated. The calibration result was validated via road marking extraction with Otsu threshold method. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
"Assessing the ability of hybrid poplar for in-situ phytoextraction of cadmium by using UAV-photogrammetry and 3D flow simulator","2018","International Journal of Remote Sensing","10.1080/01431161.2017.1422876","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041811008&doi=10.1080%2f01431161.2017.1422876&partnerID=40&md5=21ee58731c23ff415c5781878f7e3c20","The purpose of this study is to evaluate the capability of hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides × Populus nigra) to reduce cadmium (Cd) concentrations in an experimental site of Campania Region (southern Italy) subjected to illegal deposit of industrial and household waste. We propose to evaluate the efficiency of poplar for Cd phytoextraction by coupling the use of a process-based, distributed hydrological model (HydroGeoSphere, HGS) with photogrammetric images acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). This scenario-based approach exploits in-situ measurements so as to be able to reproduce reliable near-real-world processes. The original bare soil (BS; unplanted reference location) is used as benchmark and compared to the situation where poplar trees are planted (PP) for bioremediation purposes. The ‘virtual’ positions of poplars were chosen by considering the expected Cd accumulation areas that are correlated to topographic indices retrieved from the high-resolution (0.03 × 0.03 m) digital elevation model (DEM) generated by UAV photogrammetric photos. Transfer and accumulation of Cd in the poplars were described by a time-variant sink term featuring the HGS transport equation. The numerical simulations show that poplar trees are able to reduce Cd concentrations by 15%, 36%, and 64% in spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. Coupling an advanced 3D hydrological model with a high-resolution DEM generated by UAV-photogrammetry seems a promising and viable approach for assessing the efficiency of phytoremediation techniques. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Physical damage to a propeller causes additional vibration in the system during operation, and early detection of such faults may prevent further damage and potentially later catastrophic failure. In the proposed method, only a built-in accelerometer (as typically used by a multicopters flight computer) is used to provide vibration data of the vehicle, and no additional sensors are required. We exploit the fact that the motors rotate at different speeds during different phases of maneuvers, allowing a spectral analysis of measured vibrations to isolate a damaged motor. This method is shown to be effective at identifying multiple damaged propellers as well, and experimental results are presented to validate the concept. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought self-driving cars to our streets, super-automation to our factories, deep learning algorithms that beat world champions, image recognition programs that diagnose cancer more accurately than experienced oncologists can, voice recognition machines that understand speech on a par with humans and a host of other achievements which would have been hard to imagine even a decade ago. The critical interest, however, is not in what has been accomplished, but rather where technolog y is going and what will be the implications of forthcoming advances in all aspects of our lives, work and societies, including the possibility, some argue, of mass unemployment and huge income inequalities, as machines and robots powered by AI replace human labor. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss AI and related technological advancements and consider their implications for humanity in general and for a small country like Cyprus in particular. The paper is organized into three parts. It first looks at AI and its achievements and considers four scenarios of how it could affect us. In the second part, the paper presents a complementary to AI technolog y, that of intelligence augmentation (IA) that provides a different perspective to where technolog y is leading us and the implications involved. The final, third part considers the consequences of AI and IA for Cyprus and what would need to be done to exploit their advantages whilst minimizing their drawbacks. © 2019, University of Nicosia.

The current navigation systems for landing probes are based on sensor data fusion of inertial and optical sensor measurements to determine the current flight state with respect to the target body and the desired landing site. To improve the accuracy of lunar landing navigation, radiometric measurements (range and range-rate) with respect to an orbiting vehicle have been proposed in several studies. This paper analyzes the impact of range and range-rate measurements from an orbiting vehicle on the navigation accuracy. For that purpose, a baseline configuration of an optical navigation system is used which has already been taken as a reference for investigating the effect of ground-based beacons. First, the influence of the orbiter trajectory in relation to the landing trajectory is investigated. In particular, the line of sight between orbiter and lander permits a preliminary assessment of the navigation performance. Later, the effects of sensor noise for all measurements and of the orbiter ephemeris error are also evaluated. Finally, for a selected scenario, it is demonstrated that radiometric measurements with respect to an orbiter can reduce the positioning error by about 40%. © 2018, CEAS.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The insulin pump system is an autonomous, wearable external device, commonly used by diabetic patients to take insulin efficiently, as compared to manual injection through a syringe. Security attacks may disrupt the working of insulin pump system by delivering the lethal dose to patients and endanger their lives. In this paper, we ensure the correct dosing process of insulin pump system based on the combination of deep learning model and gestures performed by the patient. Specifically, we used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to predict the thresh hold value of insulin based on last three months log of insulin pump system. If the amount of insulin to be injected by the insulin pump system is greater than our predicted thresh hold amount, then our system asks the patient to perform the gesture.

We consider that a cog-nitive/secondary UAV transmitter communicates with a ground secondary receiver (SR), in the presence of a number of primary terrestrial communication links that operate over the same frequency band. We exploit the UAV's controllable mobility via trajectory design, to improve the cognitive UAV communication performance while controlling the co-channel interference at each of the primary receivers (PRs). In particular, we maximize the average achievable rate from the UAV to the SR over a finite mission/communication period by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and transmit power allocation, subject to constraints on the UAV's maximum speed, initial/final locations, and average transmit power, as well as a set of interference temperature (IT) constraints imposed at each of the PRs for protecting their communications. However, the joint trajectory and power optimization problem is non-convex and thus difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient algorithm that ensures to obtain a locally optimal solution by applying the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA). Numerical results show that our proposed joint UAV trajectory and power control scheme significantly enhances the achievable rate of the cognitive UAV communication system, as compared to benchmark schemes. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The hovering and forward flight phases have been researched widely, however the transition phase in between is more challenging and has been the subject of less research. One of the control approaches to handle the transition phase relies on model-based methods which require sophisticated wind-tunnel characterization. Accurate modeling of force and moments of a partially stalled wing and control surfaces is highly challenging and time consuming. In addition, these models usually require several flight measurements (such as angle of attack and low airspeed) that are difficult to obtain. As an alternative, some control approaches manage the transition phase without the need for sophisticated models. One example of such an approach is the Model Free Control (MFC). This paper compares the results obtained from both MFC and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) applied to fixed-wing UAV with transitioning flight capability during hovering, transition and forward flight modes. Both of the controllers are designed for a transitioning vehicle called MAVion. The simulation results demonstrated that MFC increases the stability of the aircraft, especially in disturbed flight conditions. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Underwater exploratory vehicles typically employ wide-aperture Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) imaging sensors. Although their wide aperture enables scouring large volumes of water ahead of them for obstacles, the resulting images produced are blurry due to integration over the aperture. Performing three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from this blurry data is notoriously difficult. This challenging inverse problem is further exacerbated by the presence of speckle noise and reverberations. The state-of-the-art methods in 3D reconstruction from sonar either require bulky and expensive matrix-arrays of sonar sensors or additional narrow-aperture sensors. Due to its low footprint, the latter induces gaps between reconstructed scans. Avoiding such gaps requires slow and cumbersome scanning by the vehicles that carry the scanners. In this paper, we present two reconstruction methods enabling on-site 3D reconstruction from imaging sonars of any aperture. The first of these presents an elegant linear formulation of the problem, as a blind deconvolution with a spatially varying kernel. The second method is a simple algorithmic approach for approximate reconstruction, using a nonlinear formulation. We demonstrate that our simple approximation algorithms perform 3D reconstruction directly from the data recorded by wide-aperture systems, thus eliminating the need for multiple sensors to be mounted on underwater vehicles for this purpose. Additionally, we observe that the wide aperture may be exploited to improve the coverage of the reconstructed samples (on the scanned object's surface). We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on simulated as well as real data acquired using two sensors, and we compare our work to the state of the art in sonar reconstruction. Finally, we show the employability of our reconstruction methods on field data gathered by an autonomous underwater vehicle. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This work follows this way and develops a procedure named CPS checkpointing and recovery, which leverages historical data to recover failed system states. Specially, we first propose a new concept of physical-state recovery. The essential operation is defined as rolling the system forward starting from a consistent historical system state.

Whilst the possibility of hacking a Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) has already been proven in both experimental and real-life settings, there is reason to believe that it will soon be possible to interfere with the software settings of the Implanted Pulse Generators (IPGs) that play a central role in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) systems. Whilst brainjacking raises ethical concerns pertaining to privacy and physical or psychological harm, we claim that the possibility of brainjacking DBS raises particularly profound concerns about individual autonomy, since the possibility of hacking such devices raises the prospect of third parties exerting influence over the neural circuits underpinning the subject’s cognitive, emotional and motivational states. However, although it seems natural to assume that brainjacking represents a profound threat to individual autonomy, we suggest that the implications of brainjacking for individual autonomy are complicated by the fact that technologies targeted by brainjacking often serve to enhance certain aspects of the user’s autonomy. The difficulty of ascertaining the implications of brainjacking DBS for individual autonomy is exacerbated by the varied understandings of autonomy in the neuroethical and philosophical literature. In this paper, we seek to bring some conceptual clarity to this area by mapping out some of the prominent views concerning the different dimension of autonomous agency, and the implications of brainjacking DBS for each dimension. Drawing on three hypothetical case studies, we show that there could plausibly be some circumstances in which brainjacking could potentially be carried out in ways that could serve to enhance certain dimensions of the target’s autonomy. Our analysis raises further questions about the power, scope, and necessity of obtaining prior consent in seeking to protect patient autonomy when directly interfering with their neural states, in particular in the context of self-regulating closed-loop stimulation devices. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

Specifically, security issues are a major concern because such networks, which carry vital information, are prone to various attacks. In this paper, we design and implement a novel intrusion detection and response scheme, which operates at the UAV and ground station levels, to detect malicious anomalies that threaten the network. In this scheme, a set of detection and response techniques are proposed to monitor the UAV behaviors and categorize them into the appropriate list (normal, abnormal, suspect, and malicious) according to the detected cyber-attack. We focus on the most lethal cyber-attacks that can target an UAV network, namely, false information dissemination, GPS spoofing, jamming, and black hole and gray hole attacks. Extensive simulations confirm that the proposed scheme performs well in terms of attack detection even with a large number of UAVs and attackers since it exhibits a high detection rate, a low number of false positives, and prompt detection with a low communication overhead. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Platoon members mostly communicate with each other via the current dominant vehicular radio frequency (RF) technology, IEEE 802.11p. However, this technology leads security vulnerabilities under various attacks from adversaries. Visible light communication (VLC) has the potential to alleviate these vulnerabilities by exploiting the directivity and impermeability of light. Utilizing only VLC in vehicle platoon, on the other hand, may degrade platoon stability since VLC is sensitive to environmental effects. In this paper, we propose an IEEE 802.11p and VLC-based hybrid security protocol for platoon communication, namely SP-VLC, with the goal of ensuring platoon stability and securing platoon maneuvers under data packet injection, channel overhearing, jamming, and platoon maneuver attacks. We define platoon maneuver attack based on the identification of various scenarios where a fake maneuver packet is transmitted by a malicious actor. SP-VLC includes mechanisms for the secret key establishment, message authentication, data transmission over both IEEE 802.11p and VLC, jamming detection and reaction to switch to VLC only communication and secure platoon maneuvering based on the joint usage of IEEE 802.11p and VLC. We develop a simulation platform combining realistic vehicle mobility model, realistic VLC and IEEE 802.11p channel models, and vehicle platoon management. We show the functionality of the SP-VLC protocol under all possible security attacks by performing extensive simulations. Our findings demonstrate that SP-VLC protocol generates less than 0.1% difference in the speed of and distance between platoon members during security attacks in comparison to 25% and 10% in that of previously proposed IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 802.11p-VLC hybrid protocols, respectively. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Computational complexity is a chief concern as this problem would need to be solved in an online fashion, e.g., in the case of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles. A new geometric approach to solving the game is introduced and analyzed, which changes the problem of optimizing over continuous domains to a discrete combinatoric optimization.

However, all the driving vehicles cannot be ensured to have satellite visibility. Therefore, in order to increase the accuracy and robustness of vehicle localization, it is important to have an assistant localization method for these systems by using some environmental sensing, such as cameras and radars. In this paper, we look at using multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar for vehicle localization. The performance of cross localization in MIMO radar relies on the accuracy of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. But the performance of most existing DOA estimation methods based on sparse signal recover is affected by the unknown nonuniform noise and mutual coupling. The proposed method uses a linear transformation to eliminate the influence of mutual coupling by utilizing the banded complex symmetric Toeplitz structure of the mutual coupling matrices in both transmit and receive arrays. Then, a real-valued covariance vector-based sparse Bayesian learning framework is formulated for DOA estimation by utilizing the unitary transformation, in which the variances of nonuniform noise can be updated by using the least square strategy. The proposed method can work well and provide better DOA estimation performance than the existing sparse signal recover-based algorithms in unknown mutual coupling and nonuniform noise. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Tracking the geometric formation of the network is a critical problem. Recent advantage of wireless ranging technologies (e.g., ultrawideband) enables inter-UAV distance measurement up to hundreds meters with errors in centimeter level. This makes it possible to track the network topology by the partially measured distance matrix among the UAVs, which is known as the formation tracking problem. But the measured distances are generally sparse and noisy, and the topology of UAV network is changing continuously. These cause the formation tracking highly challenging. Existing methods are generally fragile to the measurement noises and network sparsity. This paper exploits a fact that well-connected subcomponents, whose local structures can be calculated reliably, exist widely because the unevenness of node distribution in sparse networks. Therefore, a weighted component stitching (WCS) method to find the reliable components and stitch their local structures with weights is proposed for calculating the formation of the network accurately. In particular, we propose efficient two-center four-vertex-connected star-graph (2-4-star) detection and merging algorithms to extract the reliable global rigid components. A WCS algorithm and a weighted component-based Kalman filter algorithm with complexity both O(n3) are proposed for robust formation tracking in n vertex UAV networks.

More specifically, the UAV-aided data distribution and collection is substantiated in the form of a UAV-based WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). In the UAV-based WSN, a CH (Cluster Head) plays a very important role such as data collection from its members, transfer of collected data to a UAV and data distribution from a UAV to its members. Such a crucial role of a CH solicits many attackers to try to turn their compromised nodes to CHs. However, because the general CH election framework allows each node to determine a CH role autonomously, any compromised node can declare itself as a CH regardless of its qualification. In this paper, we propose a UAV-assisted CH election framework which collects residual energy of nodes, and employs them for electing new CHs and excluding the lowest energy nodes from CH candidates. Simulation results show that our framework greatly lowers CH election frequency of compromised nodes and number of messages corrupted by them. Another simulation results show that our framework reduces energy consumption of nodes, and extends lifetime of nodes greatly. Our CH election framework can be easily applied to a network of IoT devices because such a network also requires clustering for energy and data management efficiency.

Although prior works have exploited the UAV's mobility to enhance the wireless communication performance under different setups, the fundamental capacity limits of UAV-enabled/aided multiuser communication systems have not yet been characterized. To fill this gap, we consider, in this paper, a UAV-enabled two-user broadcast channel (BC), where a UAV flying at a constant altitude is deployed to send independent information to two users at different fixed locations on the ground. We aim to characterize the capacity region of this new type of BC over a given UAV flight duration, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and transmit power/rate allocations over time, subject to the UAV's maximum speed and maximum transmit power constraints. First, to draw essential insights, we consider two special cases with asymptotically large/low UAV flight duration/speed, respectively. For the former case, it is shown that a simple hover-fly-hover (HFH) UAV trajectory with time division multiple access (TDMA)-based orthogonal multiuser transmission is capacity-achieving; while in the latter case, the UAV should hover at a fixed location that is nearer to the user with larger achievable rate and in general superposition coding (SC)-based non-orthogonal transmission with interference cancellation at the receiver of the nearer user is required. Next, we consider the general case with finite UAV speed and flight duration. We show that the optimal UAV trajectory should follow a general HFH structure, i.e., the UAV successively hovers at a pair of optimal initial and final locations above the line segment connecting the two users each with a certain amount of time and flies unidirectionally between them at the maximum speed, and SC is generally needed. Furthermore, when TDMA-based transmission is considered for low-complexity implementation, we show that the optimal UAV trajectory still follows an HFH structure, but the hovering locations can only be those above the two users. Extensive simulation results are provided to verify our analysis, which also reveal useful guidelines to the practical design of UAV trajectory and communication jointly. © 1983-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Combined with the sliding mesh technique, this paper investigates a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method to simulate and analyze, in detail, the static and dynamic aerodynamic characteristics of formation with two flying wing models named as SACCON. Besides, the dynamic derivatives indicating the dynamic stability of aircrafts in formation are identified and validated, and normal single flights are also analyzed as a comparative study. The results demonstrate that, due to the wake of the leader, significant enhancements of the wingman are achieved, in terms of the lift-to-drag ratio, pitching, rolling, and yawing moments in steady states, but the static stabilities are reduced as unbalanced moments. Moreover, compared with a single aircraft, the unsteady sinusoidal motions indicate that the dynamic aerodynamics and its corresponding dynamic derivatives change in a much more complex manner. It is concluded that the initial angle of attack and distance in the formation flight are the main factors to evaluate the effect, which should be monitored and adjusted in real time for better use of the profit of formation, especially in dynamic maneuvering. © 2018 International Research Publication House.

"A Real-Time Battery Thermal Management Strategy for Connected and Automated Hybrid Electric Vehicles (CAHEVs) Based on Iterative Dynamic Programming","2018","IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","10.1109/TVT.2018.2844368","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048176028&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2018.2844368&partnerID=40&md5=d4f2190d93ed92ff9e296f802f83f607","Connected and automated hybrid electric vehicles (CAHEVs) are a potential solution to the future transportation due to their improved fuel economy, reduced emissions, and capability to mitigate congestion and improve safety. The battery thermal management (BTM) in CAHEVs is one of the crucial problems, because the lithium-ion batteries are highly temperature sensitive. Therefore, a practical and energy-efficient BTM strategy is required for both improving the operating temperature of batteries and saving energy. In this study, the dynamic programming (DP) is implemented for a BTM system in CAHEVs for achieving the optimal cooling/heating energy savings for batteries. To enhance the real-time capability, an iterative approach is proposed to approximate the optimum control strategy iteratively in a multidimensional search space. The proposed iterative DP strategy can improve the system performance and energy-efficiency by fully exploiting the future road information in CAHEVs combined with a model predictive control method. The hardware-in-the-loop validation of the proposed strategy is conducted on the UDDS and the WLTC drive cycles based on a Toyota Prius PHEV model. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed BTM strategy that leads to a considerable BTM energy reduction. © 2018 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Numerous efforts have been conducted towards such solutions by exploiting a variety of sensing systems such as satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) which can identify oil spills over sea surfaces in any environmental conditions and operational time. Such approaches include the use of artificial neural networks which effectively identify the polluted areas. Considering their remarkable abilities in many applications, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) could surpass limitations and performances of previously proposed methods. This paper describes the application of an approach that combines the merits of a DCNN with SAR imagery in order to provide a fully automated oil spill identification system. The model semantically segments the input SAR images into multiple areas of interest. The deployed DCNN was trained using multiple SAR images acquired from the Sentinel-1 satellite provided by ESA and based on EMSA records for maritime pollution events. Experiments on such challenging benchmark datasets for such an abstract problem demonstrate that the algorithm can accurately identify oil spills leading to an effective detection solution. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To lower the need for hand labeled images, virtually rendered 3D worlds have recently gained popularity. Unfortunately, creating realistic 3D content is challenging on its own and requires significant human effort. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm which combines real and synthetic data for learning semantic instance segmentation and object detection models. Exploiting the fact that not all aspects of the scene are equally important for this task, we propose to augment real-world imagery with virtual objects of the target category. Capturing real-world images at large scale is easy and cheap, and directly provides real background appearances without the need for creating complex 3D models of the environment. We present an efficient procedure to augment these images with virtual objects. In contrast to modeling complete 3D environments, our data augmentation approach requires only a few user interactions in combination with 3D models of the target object category. Leveraging our approach, we introduce a novel dataset of augmented urban driving scenes with 360 degree images that are used as environment maps to create realistic lighting and reflections on rendered objects. We analyze the significance of realistic object placement by comparing manual placement by humans to automatic methods based on semantic scene analysis. This allows us to create composite images which exhibit both realistic background appearance as well as a large number of complex object arrangements. Through an extensive set of experiments, we conclude the right set of parameters to produce augmented data which can maximally enhance the performance of instance segmentation models. Further, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach on training standard deep models for semantic instance segmentation and object detection of cars in outdoor driving scenarios. We test the models trained on our augmented data on the KITTI 2015 dataset, which we have annotated with pixel-accurate ground truth, and on the Cityscapes dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that the models trained on augmented imagery generalize better than those trained on fully synthetic data or models trained on limited amounts of annotated real data. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Indeed, to reliably perform rendezvous and docking/undocking phases between space vehicles orbiting on highly non-Keplerian orbits, such as NRHOs, represents a fundamental key technology. Rendezvous is well-known for Earth-centred missions, while no mission ever performed it on non-Keplerian orbits. The paper critically discusses the adopted approach and the obtained results in modelling the non-Keplerian relative dynamics and in synthesizing the guidance, to safely rendezvous and dock on NRHOs. The entire study is strongly driven by engineering constraints and mission requirements which lead the practical implementation. The dynamics intrinsic non-linearity—which makes the trajectories highly sensitive to small deviations—is here exploited to benefit both rendezvous operations and safety. The paper shows the relative trajectories, designed in a way that both NRHO central and unstable manifolds are used: the former to ensure the chaser relative orbit to be periodic with respect to the target, the latter to answer the passive safety philosophy here preferred. In fact, chaser deviation from target is naturally obtained, whenever on an unstable direction. Along the approaching trajectory, two holding points are assumed: on the central manifold the farthest, at about 100 km from the target, to prepare for the final approach; if a no-go is commanded, the spacecraft hovers on the central manifold, waiting for the next approach opportunity. The closest holding point is designed to lay on the unstable manifold direction, to privilege risk mitigation through passive safety, since if no active control occurs, the chaser—now just meters away from the target—naturally drifts away. The relative trajectory and approach strategy design, driven by the guidance and mission operations definition in nominal and non-nominal scenarios, is discussed in the paper: the simulations and the analyses that led to the approach corridor shape, keep-out zones radius and collision avoidance manoeuvres settling are here reported. The practical case of the cislunar space gateway servicing is here exploited to present the proposed rendezvous and approach techniques for non-Keplerian scenarios and to highlight the GRANO software tool—developed by the authors at Politecnico di Milano, ASTRA Team—flexibility for general application in the n-body framework. © 2018, Chinese Society of Astronautics.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This information is used to build computationally cheap approximations/surrogates which are subsequently used during the course of optimization in lieu of the actual simulations. However, it is possible to exploit information on pre-converged solutions if one has the control to abort simulations at various stages of convergence. This would mean access to various performance estimates in lower fidelities. Surrogate assisted optimization methods have rarely been used to deal with such classes of problem, where estimates at various levels of fidelity are available. In this article, a multiple surrogate assisted optimization approach is presented, where solutions are evaluated at various levels of fidelity during the course of the search. For any solution under consideration, the choice to evaluate it at an appropriate fidelity level is derived from neighbourhood information, i.e. rank correlations between performance at different fidelity levels and the highest fidelity level of the neighbouring solutions. Moreover, multiple types of surrogates are used to gain a competitive edge. The performance of the approach is illustrated using a simple 1D unconstrained analytical test function. Thereafter, the performance is further assessed using three 10D and three 20D test problems, and finally a practical design problem involving drag minimization of an unmanned underwater vehicle. The numerical experiments clearly demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach for such classes of problem. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The area where jamming attacks are most likely to occur is the close vicinity of the UAV landing station. Hence, to ensure reliable operations, an alternative localization technology for the approach and landing phase is needed. This paper presents a localization system for 3D position estimation based on 24 GHz FMCW cooperative radar. It has very low infrastructure requirements thanks to the combination of ranging and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation techniques employed in the ground station.

(2014) proposed a secure estimation method when the set of attacked nodes (sensors, controllers) is fixed. In this paper, we extend these results to scenarios in which the set of attacked nodes can change over time.

However, the broadcast nature of air-To-ground line-of-sight wireless channels brings a new challenge to the information security of UAV-ground communication. This paper tackles such a challenge in the physical layer by exploiting the mobility of UAV via its trajectory design. We consider a UAV-ground communication system with multiple potential eavesdroppers on the ground, where the information on the locations of the eavesdroppers is imperfect. We formulate an optimization problem, which maximizes the average worst case secrecy rate of the system by jointly designing the robust trajectory and transmit power of the UAV over a given flight duration. The nonconvexity of the optimization problem and the imperfect location information of the eavesdroppers make the problem difficult to be solved optimally.

Repercusiones socio-económicas en el sureste español e incertidumbre ante el cambio climático]","2018","Revista de Estudios Regionales","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068136772&partnerID=40&md5=f6d1ff0f9587ac9fb97d0c3525a9627c","Introduction: Given the strong global socio-economic growth that have experienced developed countries during the second half of the last century, there have been numerous hydraulic actions aimed at increasing water supply to ensure the strong expansion of urban, agricultural and hydroelectric production (Tortajada, 2016). The availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality has acquired a first-rate interest in meeting urban, tourist and rural demands in territories with a natural shortage of water resources (Rico et al., 2013). In this sense, the hydraulic planning of developed countries was based initially on the so-called ""old hydraulic policy"" based on the construction of canals, transfers and reservoirs and, since the last decades of the 20th century, with the so-called ""non-conventional sources"" or ""alternatives"" such as the use of purified and desalinated water (Fragkou and McEvoy, 2016). In Spain, investments in hydraulic infrastructure (public and private) in the last hundred years have resulted in the construction of more than 1,200 large reservoirs, more than 20 large desalination plants and various transfers of different capacity ( Hernández-Mora et al., 2014). For example, the main water transfers in Spain (around forty) add up to a capacity of about 1,300 hm3/year, which represents less than 3% of the guaranteed resources, which amount to 46,000 hm3. Objectives and Methodology: This research poses two main objectives. The first one is to analyze the socio-economic repercussions derived from the implementation of the Tagus-Segura Aqueduct (ATS) (1979) in the southeast of Spain. The second one, to analyze the future changes in the normal functioning of this hydraulic infrastructure in the future scenarios of climate change and the corrective measures and strategies carried out to mitigate their effects (proposals and alternatives). It has also been consulted on the different regulations that have a direct influence on the functioning of the ATS: Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC); Law 10/2001, of July 5, of the National Hydrological Plan (NHP); Royal Decree-Law 2/2004, of June 18, amending the Law 10/2001, of July 5, of the National Hydrological Plan; A.G.U.A. Program (2004) (Actions for the Management and Use of Water Royal Decree Law 2/2004); Law 21/2013 of December 9, on Environmental Assessment; Royal Decree 773/2014 of 12 September (Memorandum); Law 21/2015, of July 20, of Montes; And the Tagus Hydrological Plan (Royal Decree 1/2016, of 8 January). Likewise, the estimated rainfall effects in the area of study in the different reports on climate change have been analyzed (AEMET, 2017, Cedex, 2017, IPCC, 2014). Results: The participation of the ATS in the systems of supply of drinking water in high of the basin of the Segura is decisive. This work is carried out by the Commonwealth of Canals del Taibilla (MCT), which has become a key public agency for the management of water resources for urban uses in the southeast of Spain (Rico, 2016). At present, MCT has an approximate area of 12 thousand square kilometers and supplies potable water in primary network up to 79 municipalities, belonging to the provinces of Murcia, Alicante and Albacete, with a population estimated at 2.5 million inhabitants that can grow in another million more during the summer if the tourist contingent is considered. This population has had regular supply of drinking water in their homes, even during periods of intense drought, thanks to the existence of the ATS, the diversification of sources of supply, with the increasing participation of non-conventional resources and the temporary assignment of rights of water use; and to the good management carried out by the MCT and the companies in charge of the down management, have significantly increased the performance of the network. The process of the global warming that is evident in the last decades could have three direct effects on the water resources existing in the peninsular territory and, therefore, in the areas of hydrological planning analyzed, Tagus and Segura: Reduction of precipitation and, therefore, of available water resources, accompanied by an increase in temperatures and potential evapotranspiration Changes in the seasonality of rainfall Increase in the irregularity of the rains, which would lead to an increase in extreme events (droughts and heavy rainfall events) Besides, in relation to the new operating rules (limit of 400 hm3) (before were in 240 hm3), it can be seen that, if they had been in force since 1979, the ATS had not operated on numerous occasions (1983-84, 1992-93, 1995-96, 2005-07, 2008-09 and 2015-16). This is obviously due to the fact that the new rules of exploitation are more conservative and conform to new needs and realities that are more objective and fair than the previous ones. On the other hand, if the hypothetical reduction of 7% is taken into account (reduction of the rainfall due to climate change), it can be seen how practically, this reduction would not mean a substantial change in the normal operation of the ATS, since to handle that threshold of reduction, the transfer would be closed taking into account both the currently and the hypothetical reduction volumes of 7%. In addition, during these four decades of ATS operation, there have been several cyclical episodes of drought (1980-85, 1992-95, 2004-09 and 2014-16), that is to say, ""conjunctural"" dry periods which have affected the headwater of the Tagus river every ten years. Therefore, what can be deduced from this analysis is that the operation of the ATS will be conditioned, rather than by the effects of the reduction of precipitation, by the succession of dry episodes and, evidently, by the new rules of regulation, more conservative and in favor of the donor basin. Conclusions: From what can be learned from the analyzed case is that the ATS is a hydraulic infrastructure that has allowed the socio-economic development of the southeast of Spain, although it is an infrastructure questioned since its implementation in 1979 by the tensions between the donor and receiving basins. In the southeast of Spain, the commitment to desalination (National Hydrological Plan, 2001 and AGUA Program, 2004) has become a solution to increase the supply of water resources in the southeast of Spain, although they try to make this resource the solution to the long-standing controversy surrounding the ATS. It will be expected if the forecasts of climate change and reduction of contributions that have been realized on the headwater of the Tagus, where the so-called ""effect 80"" has become evident, and how the new operating rules can influence the operation of this infrastructure. Alongside this, a greater involvement of the State, the Autonomous Communities and the different political forces could be achieved in order to achieve a National Water Pact, with measures to adapt to climate change. Within these consensus measures, the maintenance and/ or revision of existing transfers should not be ruled out, or the possibility of carrying out others of a moderate size that could function from the normative development of articles 67 to 72 of TRLA. © 2018 Asociacion Universidades Publicas de Andalucia.

Following inspiration from nature we expose a new system for angle of attack estimation based on pressure measurements on the wing. Such an equipment can be used for real-time estimation of the angle of attack during flight or even further building of wind velocity vector with additional equipment. Those information can find purpose in control and stabilization of the aircraft due to inequalities seen by the wing or even for various soaring strategies that rely on active control for energy extraction. In that purpose, flying wing aircraft has been used with totally four span-wise locations for local angle of attack estimation. In-flight angle of attack estimation from differential pressure measurements on the wing has been compared with magnetic sensor with wind vane. The results have shown that pressure ports give more reliable estimation of angle of attack when compared to values given by wind vane attached to a specially designed air-boom. Difference in local angle of attack at four span-wise locations has confirmed spatial variation of turbulence in low altitude flight.

While density gradient centrifugation offers a label-free alternative avoiding the use of harsh lysis buffers for blood cell isolation, it is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process during which blood cells are subject to high-levels of centrifugal force that can artifactually activate cells. To provide a low-stress alternative to this elegant method, we miniaturized and automated this process using microfluidics to ensure continuous PBMCs isolation from whole blood while avoiding the exposure to high-levels of centrifugal stress in a simple flow-through format. Within this device, a density gradient is established by exploiting laminar flow within microfluidic channels to layer a thin stream of blood over a larger stream of Ficoll. Using this approach we demonstrate successful isolation of PBMCs from whole blood with preservation of monocytes and different lymphocyte subpopulations similar to that seen with conventional density gradient centrifugation. Evaluation of activation status of PBMCs isolated using this technique shows that our approach achieves minimal isolation process induced activation of cells in comparison to conventional lysis or density gradient centrifugation. This simple, automated microfluidic density gradient centrifugation technique can potentially serve as tool for rapid and activation-free technique for isolation of PBMCs from whole blood for point-of-care applications. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The bedrock exposure rate is an important index to assess the degree of rocky desertification in karst regions. Because of the inherent merits of macro-scale, frequency, efficiency, and synthesis, remote sensing is a promising method to monitor and assess karst rocky desertification on a large scale. However, actual measurement of the bedrock exposure rate is difficult and existing remote-sensing methods cannot directly be exploited to extract the bedrock exposure rate owing to the high complexity and heterogeneity of karst environments. Therefore, using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for Xingren County, Guizhou Province, quantitative extraction of the bedrock exposure rate based on multi-scale remote-sensing data was developed. Firstly, we used an object-oriented method to carry out accurate classification of UAVimages. From the results of rock extraction, the bedrock exposure rate was calculated at the 30 m grid scale. Parts of the calculated samples were used as training data; other data were used for model validation. Secondly, in each grid the band reflectivity of Landsat-8 OLI data was extracted and a variety of rock and vegetation indexes (e.g., NDVI and SAVI) were calculated. Finally, a network model was established to extract the bedrock exposure rate. The correlation coefficient of the network model was 0.855, that of the validation model was 0.677 and the root mean square error of the validation model was 0.073. This method is valuable for wide-scale estimation of bedrock exposure rate in karst environments. Using the quantitative inversion model, a distribution map of the bedrock exposure rate in Xingren County was obtained. © 2017, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Consequently, there is a high demand for robust and reliable counter small unmanned aerial vehicles (C-sUAV) solutions. However, traditional air defence systems may be unable to detect, identify and defeat some types of potentially hostile UAVs. Detection challenges such as small RCS values of air targets, unconventional flight patterns in low airspaces, terrain masking effects, or complex urban environments lead to high false alarm rates. Current C-sUAV systems in the market use improved radar components, originally either considered for VSHORAD (Very Short Air Defence) radar, battlefield radar, bird detection radar, perimeter surveillance radar, or high-resolution short-range radar. According to three NATO industrial advisory group (NIAG) studies [1]-[3], there is a strong need for improvement of the currently available C-sUAV systems and for the development of second generation robust and automated sense and warn systems. In addition, the evolution of advanced LSS air threats such as signature reduced drones or swarms as well as new scenarios [4] have to be considered in the development of the second generation. Therefore, many radar research activities on C-sUAV can be observed worldwide, for example research on passive radar, active multi-static radar, MIMO-radar, cognitive radar, or air-to-air radar.

The burdened cost of delivering fuel to remote locations is often significantly more expensive than the purchase price. Here it is shown that newly developed solid aluminum metal fuel is suited for remote production of liquid diesel fuels. On a volumetric basis, aluminum has more than twice the energy of diesel fuel, making it a superb structural energy vector for remote applications. Once aluminum is treated with gallium, water of nearly any purity is used to rapidly oxidize the aluminum metal which spontaneously evolves hydrogen and heat in roughly equal energetic quantities. The benign byproduct of the reaction could, in theory, be taken to an off-site facility and recycled back into aluminum using standard smelting processes or it could be left on-site as a high-value waste. The hydrogen can easily be used as a feedstock for diesel fuel, via Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reaction mechanisms, while the heat can be leveraged for other processes, including synthesis gas compression. It is shown that as long as a carbon source, such as diesel fuel, is already present, additional diesel can be made by recovering and recycling the CO2 in the diesel exhaust. The amount of new diesel that can be made is directly related to the fraction of available CO2 that is recovered, with 100% recovery being equivalent to doubling the diesel fuel. The volume of aluminum required to accomplish this is lower than simply bringing twice as much diesel and results in a 50% increase in volumetric energy density. That is, 50% fewer fuel convoys would be required for fuel delivery. Moreover, aluminum has the potential to be exploited as a structural fuel that can be used as pallets, containers, etc., before being consumed to produce diesel. Furthermore, FT diesel production via aluminum and CO2 can be achieved without sacrificing electrical power generation. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

At the heart of this is the problem of viewpoint-tolerant place recognition; in stark difference to ground robots, UAVs can revisit a scene from very different viewpoints. As a result, existing approaches struggle greatly as the task at hand violates underlying assumptions in assessing scene similarity. In this paper, we propose a place recognition framework, which exploits both efficient binary features and noisy estimates of the local 3D geometry, which are anyway computed for visual-inertial odometry onboard the UAV.

Through the parametrization of the model, we extract the generic factors of the network protocols and verify our model through the Network Simulator 3 (ns-3). By exploiting our network analysis model, we propose a novel formation control algorithm that determines the location of the UAVs to maximize the efficiency of the network. To achieve the objectives of the infrastructure, we define the formation-shaping effect as forces and elaborately design them using the generic factors. The formation algorithm continuously approaches to the optimized formation of a fleet of UAVs to enhance the overall throughput of the terrestrial devices. Our evaluations show that the algorithm guarantees remarkably higher throughput than the static formations.

We show that semantically labeled 3D point maps of the environment, together with semantically segmented images, can be efficiently used for vehicle localization without the need for detailed feature descriptors (SIFT, SURF, etc.), Thus, instead of depending on hand-crafted feature descriptors, we rely on the training of an image segmenter. The resulting map takes up much less storage space compared to a traditional descriptor based map. A particle filter based semantic localization solution is compared to one based on SIFT-features, and even with large seasonal variations over the year we perform on par with the larger and more descriptive SIFT-features, and are able to localize with an error below 1 m most of the time. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we consider the design of a real-time cooperative eco-driving strategy for a group of vehicles with mixed automated vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs). The lead vehicles in the platoon can receive the signal phase and timing information via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication and the traffic states of both the preceding vehicle and current platoon via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We propose a receding horizon model predictive control (MPC) method to minimise the fuel consumption for platoons and drive the platoons to pass the intersection on a green phase. The method is then extended to dynamic platoon splitting and merging rules for cooperation among AVs and HVs in response to the high variation in urban traffic flow. Extensive simulation tests are also conducted to demonstrate the performance of the model in various conditions in the mixed traffic flow and different penetration rates of AVs. Our model shows that the cooperation between AVs and HVs can further smooth out the trajectory of the latter and reduce the fuel consumption of the entire traffic system, especially for the low penetration of AVs. It is noteworthy that the proposed model does not compromise the traffic efficiency and the driving comfort while achieving the eco-driving strategy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

The controller area network (CAN) is the most widely used in-vehicle network for automotive safety-critical applications. Enhancing the cybersecurity ability of CAN while considering the real-time, schedulability, and cost constraints becomes an urgent issue. To address this problem, a real-time, and schedulability analysis-guaranteed security mechanism [identification hopping CAN (IDH-CAN)] is proposed in this paper, which aims to improve the security performance of CAN under the constraints of automotive real-time applications. In order to support the operation of the IDH-CAN mechanism, an IDH-CAN controller is also designed and implemented on a field-programmable gate array, which can work as a hardware firewall in the data link layer of CAN to isolate cyberattacks from the physical layer. Meanwhile, to maximize the information entropy of the CAN message ID on the physical layer, the ID hopping table generation and optimization algorithms for IDH-CAN are also proposed. Then, information security evaluation experiments based on information entropy comparison are deployed.

Often, fields are monitored using cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) but strong changes in the visual appearance of the growing crops and the field itself poses serious challenges to conventional image registration methods. In this letter, we present a method for registering images of agricultural fields taken by an UAV over the crop season and present a complete pipeline for computing temporally aligned three-dimensional (3-D) point clouds of the field. Our approach exploits the inherent geometry of the crop arrangement in the field, which remains mostly static over time. This allows us to register the images even in the presence of strong visual changes. To this end, we propose a scale invariant, geometric feature descriptor that encodes the local plant arrangement geometry. The experiments suggest that we are able to register images taken over the crop season, including situations where matching with an off-the-shelf visual descriptor fails. We evaluate the accuracy of our matching system with respect to manually labeled ground truth. We furthermore illustrate that the reconstructed 3-D models are qualitatively correct and the registration results allow for monitoring growth parameters at a per plant level. © 2016 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

CPS also have stringent requirements on real-time operation and safety that are fulfilled by rigorous model design and verification. In the real-time literature, adaptation is mostly limited to off-line modeling of well known and predicted transitions; but this is not appropriate for cyber physical systems as each transition can have unique and unknown characteristics. In the adaptive systems literature, adaptation solutions are silent about timely execution and about the underlying hardware possibilities that can potentially speed up execution. This paper presents a solution for designing adaptive cyber physical systems by using parametric models that are verified during the system execution (i.e., online), so that adaptation decisions are made based on the timing requirements of each particular adaptation event. Our approach allows the system to undergo timely adaptations that exploit the potential parallelism of the software and its execution over multicore processors. We exemplify the approach on a specific use case with autonomous vehicles communication, showing its applicability for situations that require time-bounded online adaptations. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The hierarchical FCC, which exploits both centralized and distributed computing architectures, is very promising to support computation offloading in emerging computation-demanding mobile applications. In our design, UAVs integrating computing platforms act as small distributed clouds while the macro base station (BS) integrates a more powerful central cloud server. Furthermore, the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology is employed for data communication. We assume that mobile users (UEs) and (UAVs) can change their locations over time and we consider the joint task offloading, user-cloud/cloudlet association, transmit power allocation, and path planning to minimize the total weighted consumed power of the system. To tackle the underlying non-convex mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP), we propose an iterative two-phase algorithm. Specifically, we iteratively solve the user-cloud/cloudlet association problem in the first phase and address the joint resource allocation, path planning problem in the second phase. Furthermore, we employ the difference of convex (DC) optimization method in the second phase to approximate the non-convex bilinear functions and propose to transform the non-convex INLP to the integer linear program (ILP) in the first phase.

Specifically, we employ the GP upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) as the optimization criteria to adaptively plan sampling paths that balance the exploitation-exploration trade-off. Path planning at the initial stage focuses on exploring and learning a model of the environment, and later, on exploiting the learned model to focus sampling around regions that exhibit extreme sensory measurements and much higher spatial variability, denoted as the Region of Interest (ROI). The integration of the CE trajectory optimization allows the sampling density to be dynamically adjusted based on the latest sensory measurements, thus providing an efficient sampling strategy for sensing and localizing the ROI. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in exploring simulated scalar fields with single or multiple ROIs. Field experiments with an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) in a coastal bathymetry mapping mission validate the approach's capability in quickly exploring and mapping the given area, and then focusing and increasing the sampling density around the deepest region, as a surrogate for e.g. the extremal concentration of a pollutant in the environment. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The expected effect in winglet usage is the increase of the lift coefficient and the decrease of the drag coefficient. These aspects play a very important role in determining aerodynamic performance. Many researches have been done in order to determine the most effective winglet designs to further explore the effects on aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Based on that fact, in this study the use of winglet on UAV is discussed. This research has been conducted using a simulation software with turbulent model k-ω SST. The freestream velocity used is 10 m / s (Re=2.3 × 104) with an angle of attack (α) = 0o, 2o, 4o, 6o, 8o, 10o,12o, 15o, 16o, 17o and 19o . Model specimens are airfoils Eppler 562 with and without winglet. Winglet used in this study are wingtip fences with forward and rearward configuration. From the research, it has been found that the addition of winglet can minimize vorticity magnitude behind the wing especially forward wingtip fence. Forward wingtip fence results in a smaller vorticity area than plain wing and rearward wingtip fence although the vorticities increase with the increase of the angles of attack. In addition, the forward wingtip fence can prevent the formation of tip vortex better than the rearward one. © 2018 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This fact poses risks to human health and safety, threatens animal and agricultural resources, and impacts the economy. The lack of real-Time information about the environmental condition is the major cause behind poor managing and controlling of environmental disasters. Besides, Litani River is a long narrow-basin river. Hence, traditional methods and satellite-based remote sensing techniques are ineffective and aggravate overheads in terms of labor, time, and cost. The proposed approach makes use of the availability and the affordability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to circumvent the limited capabilities of currently available methods dedicated to water pollution detection and tracking. The main objective of the proposed approach is to provide a novel solution that can assist the government authorities to enhance their ability to detect water pollution and track the sources of pollutants. It aims to demonstrate an effective low-cost tool that enables real-Time detection of pollutants, identifying their nature, specifying their location, and tracking their sources.

To solve the problem of motion compensation, an angle-dependent model and a secondorder range-dependent model are introduced into autofocusing by previous researchers, but the first one relies too much on the geometric angle while the latter has limited fitting order for solution. We present a higher order range-dependent model, which can approximate analytical solution. Nevertheless, an increase in the fitting order makes the matrix in this model underdetermined. Based on the theoretical proof, this higher order model can be tackled by exploitation of compressive sensing (CS) theory.

To accomplish this, we apply 1) a search channel formalism to the discrete search modeling paradigm to develop information measures as a function of searcher regional visitation; and 2) a receiver operator characteristic analysis to map sensor detection characteristics to search events. We formulate an area search game where player action directs where and how information is collected under a fixed cost constraint on search effort.

We describe a new algorithmic capability for solving the search allocation problem where searchers can collaborate in their efforts to resolve false alarm outcomes.

Instead, they operate near points of critical behavior located at the boundary between different phases. Certain authors link some of the properties of criticality with the ability of living systems to generate autonomous or intrinsically generated behavior. However, these claims remain highly speculative. In this paper, we intend to explore the connection between criticality and autonomous behavior through conceptual models that show how embodied agents may adapt themselves toward critical points. We propose to exploit maximum entropy models and their formal descriptions of indicators of criticality to present a learning model that drives generic agents toward critical points. Specifically, we derive such a learning model in an embodied Boltzmann machine by implementing a gradient ascent rule that maximizes the heat capacity of the controller in order to make the network maximally sensitive to external perturbations. We test and corroborate the model by implementing an embodied agent in the Mountain Car benchmark test, which is controlled by a Boltzmann machine that adjusts its weights according to the model. We find that the neural controller reaches an apparent point of criticality, which coincides with a transition point of the behavior of the agent between two regimes of behavior, maximizing the synergistic information between its sensors and the combination of hidden and motor neurons. Finally, we discuss the potential of our learning model to answer questions about the connection between criticality and the capabilities of living systems to autonomously generate intrinsic constraints on their behavior. We suggest that these “critical agents” are able to acquire flexible behavioral patterns that are useful for the development of successful strategies in different contexts.

The average quantity of ship-generated oil that ends up in the sea exceeds 350,000 tonnes per year. When an oil spill occurs, either in open or confined sea, the ecological damage on the local ecosystem could be huge and irreversible. In view of the above, there is a pressing need for continuous refinement of the existing means and the development and implementation of new technologies with help of Robotics for oil spill combating. To minimize the adverse environmental effects of an oil spill, research should focus to devise technologies that are able to confront the oil, aiming at its actual removal when this is still floating at sea. This paper describe robotic unit of high-power autonomy that adsorb oil over water surface with the help of Nano-particle and are able to recover oil from Nano-material when placed in magnetic field. A prototype model of robot with constraint design of floating and assembly of different parts inside it has been made with the help of 3D printing for above investigation. The robots suck oily water separating clear water to the outside and creating a stream of oil in the center.

Its expression and activity are consistently linked to cellular transformation, as well as tumor initiation and progression. Due to this central role, STAT3 is widely considered a good target for anti-cancer therapy; however, the success of these approaches has been, so far, very limited. Notably, on one side, STAT3 is aberrantly active in many breast cancers, on the other, at the physiological level, it is the main mediator of epithelial cell death during post-lactation mammary-gland involution, thus strongly suggesting that its biological functions are highly context-specific. One of the most peculiar features of STAT3 is that it can act both in cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous manners, simultaneously modulating the phenotypes of the tumor cells and their microenvironment. Here, we focus on the role of STAT3 in breast cancer progression, discussing the potential contrasting roles of STAT3 activation in the establishment of locally recurrent and distant metastatic disease. Based on the most recent literature, depending on the tumor cell type, the local microenvironment status, and the stage of the disease, either STAT3 activation or inactivation can support disease progression. Accordingly, cancer cells dynamically exploit STAT3 activity to carry out transcriptional programs somehow contrasting and complementary, such as supporting survival and growth, dormancy and awakening, stem cell-like features, and inflammation, immune response, and immune evasion. As a consequence, to achieve clinical efficacy, the conception and testing of anti-STAT3 targeted therapies will need a very careful evaluation of these opposing roles and of the most appropriate tumor context, disease stage and patient population to treat. © 2018 by the authors.

"Locating emergent trees in a tropical rainforest using data from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)","2018","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","10.1016/j.jag.2018.05.024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065068874&doi=10.1016%2fj.jag.2018.05.024&partnerID=40&md5=00fd84498ac64d5984ed6cd2b1c1f22a","Emergent trees, which are taller than surrounding trees with exposed crowns, provide crucial services to several rainforest species especially to endangered primates such as gibbons and siamangs (Hylobatidae). Hylobatids show a preference for emergent trees as sleeping sites and for vocal displays, however, they are under threat from both habitat modifications and the impacts of climate change. Traditional plot-based ground surveys have limitations in detecting and mapping emergent trees across a landscape, especially in dense tropical forests. In this study, a method is developed to detect emergent trees in a tropical rainforest in Sumatra, Indonesia, using a photogrammetric point cloud derived from RGB images collected using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). If a treetop, identified as a local maximum in a Digital Surface Model generated from the point cloud, was higher than the surrounding treetops (Trees_EM), and its crown was exposed above its neighbours (Trees_SL; assessed using slope and circularity measures), it was identified as an emergent tree, which might therefore be selected preferentially as a sleeping tree by hylobatids. A total of 54 out of 63 trees were classified as emergent by the developed algorithm and in the field. The algorithm is based on relative height rather than canopy height (due to a lack of terrain data in photogrammetric point clouds in a rainforest environment), which makes it equally applicable to photogrammetric and airborne laser scanning point cloud data. © 2018 The Authors","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, a driver and traffic manager can be vulnerable to various attacks because such information is transmitted through a public channel. Therefore, secure mutual authentication has become an important security issue, and many authentication schemes have been proposed. In 2017, Mohit et al. proposed an authentication protocol for WSNs in vehicular communications to ensure secure mutual authentication. However, their scheme cannot resist various attacks such as impersonation and trace attacks, and their scheme cannot provide secure mutual authentication, session key security, and anonymity. In this paper, we propose a secure authentication protocol for WSNs in vehicular communications to resolve the security weaknesses of Mohit et al.’s scheme. Our authentication protocol prevents various attacks and achieves secure mutual authentication and anonymity by using dynamic parameters that are changed every session. We prove that our protocol provides secure mutual authentication by using the Burrows–Abadi–Needham logic, which is a widely accepted formal security analysis. We perform a formal security verification by using the well-known Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications tool, which shows that the proposed protocol is safe against replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. We compare the performance and security properties of our protocol with other related schemes. Overall, the proposed protocol provides better security features and a comparable computation cost. Therefore, the proposed protocol can be applied to practical WSNs-based vehicular communications. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Due to its non-intrusive, passive nature and high information content, vision is an attractive sensing modality, particularly at shallower depths. However, factors such as light refraction and absorption, suspended particles in the water, and color distortion affect the quality of visual data, resulting in noisy and distorted images. AUVs that rely on visual sensing thus face difficult challenges and consequently exhibit poor performance on vision-driven tasks. This paper proposes a method to improve the quality of visual underwater scenes using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with the goal of improving input to vision-driven behaviors further down the autonomy pipeline. Furthermore, we show how recently proposed methods are able to generate a dataset for the purpose of such underwater image restoration. For any visually-guided underwater robots, this improvement can result in increased safety and reliability through robust visual perception. To that effect, we present quantitative and qualitative data which demonstrates that images corrected through the proposed approach generate more visually appealing images, and also provide increased accuracy for a diver tracking algorithm. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The fuzzy PID gains scheduling problem for the stabilization of the roll, pitch and yaw dynamics of the QTW vehicle is formulated as a constrained optimization problem and solved thanks to improved PSO algorithms. PSO algorithms with variable inertia weight (PSO-In), PSO with constriction factor (PSO-Co) and PSO with possibility updating strategies (PSO-gbest) are proposed. Such variants of the PSO algorithm aim further to improve the exploration and exploitation capabilities of such a stochastic algorithm as well as its convergence fastness. The robustness of the designed PSO-based fuzzy GS-PID controllers under actuators faults is shown on the non-linear model of the QTW. All optimized fuzzy GS-PID controllers are then co-simulated within a processor-in-the-loop (PIL) framework based on an embedded NI myRIO-1900 board and a host PC. Such a proposed software (SW) and hardware (HW) computer aided design (CAD) platform is based on the Control Design and Simulation (CDSim) module of the LabVIEW environment as well as a set-up Network Streams-based data communication protocol.

We report a real-time fluorescence nucleic acid testing device for malaria field detection with automated and scalable sample preparation capability. The device consists a compact analyzer and a disposable microfluidic reagent compact disc. The parasite DNA sample preparation and subsequent real-time LAMP detection were seamlessly integrated on a single microfluidic compact disc, driven by energy efficient non-centrifuge based magnetic field interactions. Each disc contains four parallel testing units which could be configured either as four identical tests or as four species-specific tests. When configured as species-specific tests, it could identify two of the most life-threatening malaria species (P. falciparum and P. vivax). The NAT device is capable of processing four samples simultaneously within 50 min turnaround time. It achieves a detection limit of ~0.5 parasites/µl for whole blood, sufficient for detecting asymptomatic parasite carriers. The combination of the sensitivity, specificity, cost, and scalable sample preparation suggests the real-time fluorescence LAMP device could be particularly useful for malaria screening in the field settings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The assignment of check blocks to check those signals must be performed using the available but possibly incomplete or uncertain information and within the delay bounds dictated by the control loop. Moreover, the assignment should remain unpredictable against an adversary who is able to observe/probe the assignment placed and adapt her attack methods accordingly. Due to the large number of potential check blocks that can be assigned, their varying effectiveness in detecting a wide range of cyber-attacks, and the uncertainty on the exact number of signals that need to be checked and protected, finding such strategic assignment is a critical endeavor. This paper presents two-stage stochastic programming models for equipping the CPS control loops with the proper check blocks to secure them. The formulation is based on a game theoretical approach to enable the defender to find an optimal randomized (i.e., mixed strategy) assignment of check blocks while abiding to the control-loop constraints. The models incorporate uncertainty in the number of signals to be checked/protected and capture various degrees of overhead in the operation of the check blocks.

Bayesian game means that game participants do not have complete information on the profit function of the opponent. In this paper, incomplete information means that the IDS agent is not sure of the type of attacker and the attacker is not sure whether its neighbor node is an IDS agent or not.

Previous models that attempted to utilize this information usually required the user to input empirical values for critical model parameters, leading to less optimal performance. Multi-view image information is useful for improving classification accuracy, but the methods to assimilate multi-view information to make it usable for context driven models have not been explored in the literature. Here we propose a novel method to exploit the multi-view information for generating class membership probability. Moreover, we develop a new conditional random field model to integrate multi-view information and context information to further improve landcover classification accuracy. This model does not require the user to manually input parameters because all parameters in the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model are fully learned from the training dataset using the gradient descent approach. Using multi-view data extracted from small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs), we experimented with Gaussian Mixed Model (GMM), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) classifiers to test model performance. The results showed that our model improved average overall accuracies from 58.3% to 74.7% for the GMM classifier, 75.8% to 87.3% for the RF classifier, 75.0% to 84.4% for the SVM classifier and 80.3% to 86.3% for the DCNN classifier. Although the degree of improvement may depend on the specific classifier respectively, the proposed model can significantly improve classification accuracy irrespective of classifier type. © 2018","Article","Final","Scopus"

This epidemic has affected correctional facilities with an increased smuggling of illicit drugs concealed in envelopes, letters, greeting cards, and business cards to inmates. Short-wave infrared chemical imaging sensors are being successfully applied to the automated, high confidence detection of drugs concealed in prison mail. Once detected, end users have a need to confirm the detection and to identify the specific drug being detected. The challenge for identification is that the spectral signature of the concealed drug is often convolved with the spectral signature of the piece of mail (substrate) in which the drug is concealed. This paper presents a method to remove the substrate signal from the substrate/drug mixture signal followed by a set of 3 spectral identification methods. The substrate signature is estimated by a region of interest that is spatially local to the detection, and linear unmixing uses this substrate signature to calculate the residual spectra in the detection pixels. These residual spectra represent the isolated drug spectra, and they are compared with a spectral drug library via Euclidean distance, target factor analysis, and adaptive cosine estimator methods. This methodology was applied to a set of 116 positive- and negative-control samples spanning a range of drugs and concealment methods with the result that 90 of the 104 positive-control samples were identified correctly (86.5%) and 0 of the 12 negative-control samples were incorrectly identified as a drug in the library (0%).

In some universities we can find RFID system present for attendance. The manual system of attendance is very time consuming and may not be much efficient as well. Whereas RFID based attendance is also not much reliable as we don't know if the RFID card is actually used by the student whom it belongs or not. Both existing techniques for attendance system have problems in it.So our paper has used Image Processing techniques and automated the attendance system where the attendance is taken by the system by recognizing the faces of the students. The system has dataset of known faces or students such that when any unknown face detected inside the classroom, he/she will be recognized as an intruder. This will safeguard the students from any kind of invasion or attack.

Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the LQR-based Luenberger observer is deliberated for autonomous level flight of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) which has been attained productively. Various modes like phugoid and roll modes are exploited for controlling the rates of UAV. The Luenberger observer is exploited for estimation of the mysterious states of the system. The rates of roll, yaw and pitch are used as an input to the observer, while the remaining states such as velocities and angles have been anticipated. The main advantage of using Luenberger observer was to reduce the cost of the system which has been achieved lucratively. The Luenberger observer proposes sturdiness at the rate of completion to conquest over the turmoil and insecurities to overcome the privileged recital. The FlightGear simulator is exploited for the endorsement of the recital of the Luenberger observer-based autopilot. The level flight has been subjugated lucratively and has been legitimated by exploiting the FlightGear simulator. The authenticated and the validated results are offered in this paper. Microsoft Visual Studio has been engaged as a medium between the MATLAB and FlightGear Simulator. Findings: The suggested observer based on LQR ensures the lucrative approximation of the unknown states of the system as well as the successful level flight of the system. The Luenberger observer is used for approximation of states while LQR is used as controller. Originality/value: In this research work, not only the estimation of unknown states of both longitudinal and lateral model is made but also the level flight is achieved by using those estimated states and the autopilot is validated by using the FlightGear, while in most of the research work only the estimation is made of only longitudinal or lateral model. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It is visible, especially in the case of city exploitation conditions of the electric vehicle. Independent on the kind of use multispeed transmission its application in pure electric drive required its automated operation, both for vehicle acceleration and deceleration. In the case of Automated Manual Transmission the disadvantage is interrupted driving torque during gear shifting. This negative feature can be removed thanks to the proper drive train structure. One of them is proposed dual motor - single shaft drive structure. It consists of two electric motors. One of them is connected to the multispeed transmission input while the second is connected to the multispeed transmission output shaft and then to the final drive. This way of electric motor arrangement in electric drive structure puts together the benefits of multi speed gearbox application as well as the possibility of vehicles propelling during gear shifting. Additionally, compared to the classic electric drive structure with multispeed transmission, each motor rated power can be limited because the total drive power is the sum of both the motor powers. It is resulting in motors current limitation thus the same the losses are also limited and the drive efficiency increase. It seems that the effect on energy saving can be greater when both motors cooperate together in the proper way. This cooperation depends on both motor torque distribution. The motor torque distribution must be done under best efficiency motor operation condition. In the paper the analyses of the torque distribution influence on efficiency and battery power for the proposed structure of electric drive was done. There was proposed the definition of torque distribution based on the required output torque demand. The factors allowing the evaluation of quality torque distribution have been proposed. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Integrating UAVs into cellular networks is a promising solution to extend the range but poses new challenges to the transport protocols. To ensure the flight safety, the transmission of UAV commands and missionrelated data is required to be reliable with low latency. In this paper, we propose a Low-latency Reliable Transmission (LRT) protocol by exploiting the rateless and online properties of online network coding. We design the LRT, implement it, and evaluate its performance in terms of the in-order per message delay. Experimental results show that LRT can provide lowlatency transmission service comparable to that of UDP while giving the same reliability of TCP, which makes it an attractive option for Network-Connected UAV applications. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To operate autonomously and safely, a UAV must be equipped with a path planning module capable of quickly recalculating a feasible and quasi-optimal path in flight while in the event a new obstacle or threat has been detected or simply if the destination point is changed during the mission. To allow for a fast path planning, this paper proposes a parallel implementation of the genetic algorithm on graphics processing unit (GPU). The trajectories are built as series of line segments connected by circular arcs resulting in smooth paths suitable for fixed-wing UAVs. The fitness function we defined takes into account the dynamic constraints of the UAVs and aims to minimize fuel consumption and average flying altitude in order to improve range and avoid detection by enemy radars. This fitness function is also implemented on the GPU and different parallelization strategies were developed and tested for each step of the fitness evaluation. By exploiting the massively parallel architecture of GPUs, the execution time of the proposed path planner was reduced by a factor of 290x compared to a sequential execution on CPU. The path planning module developed was tested using 18 scenarios on six realistic three-dimensional terrains with multiple no-fly zones. We found that the proposed GPU-based path planner was able to find quasi-optimal solutions in a timely fashion allowing in-flight planning. © 1965-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To achieve this, we adopt a generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) strategy, which improves upon a pre-trained behavior cloning policy. Our approach overcomes the disadvantages of previous methods, as they heavily depend on the full knowledge of the location and velocity information of nearby pedestrians, which not only requires specific sensors, but also the extraction of such state information from raw sensory input could consume much computation time. In this paper, our proposed GAIL-based model performs directly on raw depth inputs and plans in real-time. Experiments show that our GAIL-based approach greatly improves the safety and efficiency of the behavior of mobile robots from pure behavior cloning. The real-world deployment also shows that our method is capable of guiding autonomous vehicles to navigate in a socially compliant manner directly through raw depth inputs.

This necessitates faster and more efficient ways of identifying the voltage stability (VS) limits, associated with specific bifurcation points of power system model, which are suitable for real-time applications. To date, continuation power flow (CPF) has conventionally been used to identify bifurcation points of power systems, through plotting power-voltage (P-V) curves. However, existing CPF methods are complex and computationally demanding. To tackle this issue, in this study, accurate identification of both saddle-node and limit-induced bifurcation points of power systems is carried out by using a new and efficient continuous power flow algorithm, in which all the complexities associated with the existing CPF methods are relaxed. Low execution time (as compared to the existing CPF methods), ease of implementation, and automated applicability, make the proposed algorithm highly suitable for fast and accurate VS assessment of renewable-rich, uncertain, power systems.

These examples are intentionally designed by making imperceptible perturbations and often mislead a DNN into making an incorrect prediction. This phenomenon means that there is significant risk in applying DNNs to safety-critical applications, such as driverless cars. To address this issue, we present a visual analytics approach to explain the primary cause of the wrong predictions introduced by adversarial examples. The key is to analyze the datapaths of the adversarial examples and compare them with those of the normal examples. A datapath is a group of critical neurons and their connections. To this end, we formulate the datapath extraction as a subset selection problem and approximately solve it based on back-propagation. A multi-level visualization consisting of a segmented DAG (layer level), an Euler diagram (feature map level), and a heat map (neuron level), has been designed to help experts investigate datapaths from the high-level layers to the detailed neuron activations. Two case studies are conducted that demonstrate the promise of our approach in support of explaining the working mechanism of adversarial examples. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The Smart grid technologies are becoming the most important entities in the electric power sector, in terms of modernizing the legacy grid with high-level penetration of RES and maintain reliability and quality of electric power. Exploitation of advanced technologies to optimize the power usage and reduce greenhouse gasses emission is inevitably the main concerns for the electric utility. RES integration brought so many issues along with their advantages. Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEV) during last decade has shown drastic market growth with reduced cost and higher energy density storage. Bulk number of PEV integration with uncoordinated charging schedule is a big hurdle to power system operation. This paper mainly focuses on the challenges and issues that will arise in Smart Distribution System (SDS) because of high-level penetration of both RES and PEV. The impacts of intermittent PES and uncoordinated PEVs on distribution network stability are discussed. Exploitation of PEV as a storage unit with bi-directional power flow is discussed to mitigate solar and wind power generation fluctuations. Real time data from Danish distribution network is used for case study to demonstrate PEV utilization for grid ancillary support.                          © 2018 the Author(s).

Also, the protocol has several security limitations including the transmission of user identity in the plaintext over the communication channel, synchronization between communication entities and high bandwidth consumption. Many AKA protocols were proposed by the researchers to defeat these problems of the UMTS network. However, these protocols fulfill the security requirements such as mutual authentication, integrity and confidentiality. But, none of them succeed to defeat the single key problem in the communication network. In this article, we propose the performance and security enhanced (PASE-AKA) protocol for UMTS network. The proposed protocol solves the problem of single key during the authentication process and avoids all the identified attacks on the communication network. The formal security analysis of the proposed protocol is carried out by Automated Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The analysis shows that the protocol achieves the security goals and secure against various known attacks. Finally, the quantitative analysis of the PASE-AKA shows that the protocol provides the improved security compared to existing UMTS-AKA protocols with acceptable communication and computation overhead. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

An FCS contains a Central Processing Unit (CPU), typically in the form of a microcontroller, referred to as the autopilot, connected to many subsystems to measure its environment, including accelerations, angular rates, dynamic and absolute pressures, and position. The autopilot periodically extracts data from the on-board sensors and processes those using navigational algorithms. The results of these computations are used to position actuators connected to the control surfaces of the UASs, causing it to fly in a correct way to perform the required mission. This process is performed in real-Time, typically at the rate of 50 Hz or more. Any interruption or corruption of this process can cause the UAS to fail to perform its mission, or ultimately crash and be destroyed.

We present a novel generative adversarial network (DEFO-NET), able to predict body deformations under external forces from a single RGB-D image.

Defo-netinherits the generalisation properties of GANs. This means that the network is able to reconstruct the whole 3-D appearance of the object given a single depth view of the object and to generalise to unseen object configurations. Contrary to traditional finite element methods, our approach is fast enough to be used in real-time applications. We apply the network to the problem of safe and fast navigation of mobile robots carrying payloads over different obstacles and floor materials.

This new macroeconomic transformation caused by globalisation introduced new challenges for critical infrastructure management. By replacing manual tasks with automated decision making and sophisticated technology, no doubt we feel much more secure than half a century ago. As the technological advancement takes root, so does the maturity of security threats. It is common that today’s critical infrastructures are operated by non-computer experts, e.g. nurses in health care, soldiers in military or firefighters in emergency services. In such challenging applications, protecting against insider attacks is often neither feasible nor economically possible, but these threats can be managed using suitable risk management strategies. Security technologies, e.g. firewalls, help protect data assets and computer systems against unauthorised entry. However, one area which is often largely ignored is the human factor of system security. Through social engineering techniques, malicious attackers are able to breach organisational security via people interactions.

However, reliable autonomous vehicles in which the ‘driver’ never has to take over the wheel are still in the distant future. At first, cars will only drive themselves under certain conditions. When these conditions are not met the car will prompt the driver with a take-over request (TOR). In this study, a simulator was used to investigate whether drivers could spot latent hazards in the road and traffic scene immediately after manual driving had become obligatory (that is, after a TOR). A latent hazard is a traffic situation in which precursors of a hazard are visible. The number of latent hazards spotted was assumed to be an indicator of the driver's situation awareness. Latent hazards may or may not materialize into acute threatening situations in which a crash is very likely. The simulator drive contained eight latent hazards (that did not materialize). The default mode was automated driving; however, when participants approached a latent hazard a TOR was prompted. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: in the 4 s group the TOR was prompted four seconds before participants had to resume manual driving, and in the 6 s group the time allowed was six seconds. All participants played a computer game on a tablet while the simulator car was in automated mode. Their gaze directions were recorded with an eye tracker during the entire trip of approximately 45 min. On average, participants in the 4 s group gazed at 29% (SD = 16.5) of the latent hazards, and participants in the 6 s group gazed at 47% (SD = 17.8). A generalized linear model for binomial data revealed that this difference was significant (χ2 (1, N = 43) = 11.23, p <.01). This result indicates that drivers need time to develop situation awareness when they have to resume driving. It could be that, after having been out of the loop, drivers have to construct a mental representation of the traffic situation before they can recognize latent hazards. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

Lodging is a natural disaster that can cause significant yield losses and threaten food security. Lodging identification and analysis contributes to evaluate disaster losses and cultivates lodging-resistant maize varieties. In this study, we collected visible and multispectral images with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and introduce a comprehensive methodology and workflow to extract lodging features from UAV imagery. We use statistical methods to screen several potential feature factors (e.g., texture, canopy structure, spectral characteristics, and terrain), and construct two nomograms (i.e., Model-1 and Model-2) with better validation performance based on selected feature factors. Model-2 was superior to Model-1 in term of its discrimination ability, but had an over-fitting phenomenon when the predicted probability of lodging went from 0.2 to 0.4. The results show that the nomogram could not only predict the occurrence probability of lodging, but also explore the underlying association between maize lodging and the selected feature factors. Compared with spectral features, terrain features, texture features, canopy cover, and genetic background, canopy structural features were more conclusive in discriminating whether maize lodging occurs at the plot scale. Using nomogram analysis, we identified protective factors (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI and canopy elevation relief ratio, CRR) and risk factors (i.e., Hcv) related to maize lodging, and also found a problem of terrain spatial variability that is easily overlooked in lodging-resistant breeding trials. © 2018 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This robotic AS/RS not only retrieves orders in an optimal sequence, but also creates an optimal store ready pallet of any order. Adapting the Travelling Salesman Problem to warehousing, the decision to be made includes finding the optimal sequence of orders, and optimal sequence of items inside each order, that jointly minimise total travel times. In the first phase, as a control problem, we develop an avoidance strategy for the robot (or automatic stacker crane) movement sequence. This approach detects the collision occurrence causing unsafe handling of hazardous items and prevents the occurrence of it by a collision-free robot movement sequence.

To evaluate the performance of the CE method, a computational analysis is performed over various test problems.

After a recent outbreak of T. pityocampa in Catalonia, Spain, we attempted to estimate the damage severity by capturing the maximum defoliation period over winter between pre-outbreak and post-outbreak images. The difference in vegetation index (dVI) derived from Landsat 8 was used as the change detection indicator and was further calibrated with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery. Regression models between predicted dVIs and observed defoliation degrees by UAV were compared among five selected dVIs for the coefficient of determination. Our results found the highest R-squared value (0.815) using Moisture Stress Index (MSI), with an overall accuracy of 72%, as a promising approach for estimating the severity of defoliation in affected areas where ground-truth data is limited. We concluded with the high potential of using UAVs as an alternative method to obtain ground-truth data for cost-effectively monitoring forest health. In future studies, combining UAV images with satellite data may be considered to validate model predictions of the forest condition for developing ecosystem service tools. © 2018 by the authors.

Automatic recognition of activities of daily living (ADLS) has been a hot research topic in pervasive computing. However, most existing methods have limitations in development cost, privacy exposure, and inconvenience for residents. To cope with the limitations, this article presents a new ADL recognition system especially for OPH. To minimize the development cost as well as intrusions to user and house, the system exploits an IoT-based environment sensing device, called autonomous sensor box (sensorbox) which can autonomously measure 7 kinds of environment attributes. The system then applies machine-learning techniques to predict 7 kinds of ADLS. Finally, this article conducts an experiment within an actual apartment of a single user. The result shows that the proposed system achieves the average accuracy of ADLS recognition with about 88%, by carefully developing the features of environment attributes.

Up to now, obstacles and other UAVs are still the main factors that threaten the flight safety. In this paper, we present a solution for formation flight and obstacle avoidance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which can achieve cluster situational awareness, autonomous formation control and intelligent collaborative decision making. The main idea of this algorithm is to consider all UAV members as a whole and control the internal and external of the UAV system separately. Inside the system, a communication topology is set up. They use consensus algorithm to keep formation and avoid collision between UAVs. Moreover, we use the weight coefficient to set the priority for every UAV. Outside the system, an improved artificial potential field method is built for UAV system. We improved the safety distance and the traditional artificial potential to make them more suitable for the UAV obstacle avoidance task. Even when UAVs reach obstacles at high speed and small angle, they will have enough time and space to change flight direction. The internal control algorithms and external control algorithms are integrated to form the virtual total force by modifying the Reynolds clustering rules. Three track instructions are obtained from this virtual force. Finally, the effectiveness of cooperative obstacle avoidance algorithm is proved by MATLAB. © 2018 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The antenna aperture occupies a cubical volume with electrical dimensions of 0.0107 λ0 × 0.0107 λ0 × 0.0033 λ0 , where λ0 is the free-space wavelength at its lowest frequency of operation and is used for DF over a 100 : 1 bandwidth. The antenna array is composed of four hexagonal-cone-shaped monopoles on a finite ground plane. The antennas are loaded with top hats and exploit the near-field parasitic elements to obtain the realized gain values close to the theoretical limits over their entire frequency band of operation. A simple, yet robust null-steering technique is used both on its own and also in conjunction with the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, as signal-processing methods, to detect the direction of arrival of the wave over the entire 100 : 1 bandwidth. A scaled prototype of the antenna was fabricated and used to perform DF experiments in the field in the VHF-UHF band. The DF system demonstrates azimuthal bearing accuracies comparable to the Cramer-Rao-Lower-Bound values calculated for the measured received signal-to-noise ratios over the whole frequency range. The DF performance of the full-scale version of this antenna, when mounted on a representative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), is also examined through computer simulations.

City and local government officials continue to face challenges in optimizing crowd flow, synchronizing traffic and mitigating threats or dangerous situations. One of the major challenges faced by city planners and traffic engineers is developing a robust traffic controller that eliminates traffic congestion and imbalanced traffic flow at intersections. Ensuring that traffic moves smoothly and minimizing the waiting time in intersections requires automated vehicle detection techniques for controlling the traffic light automatically, which are still challenging problems. In this paper, we propose an intelligent traffic pattern collection and analysis model, named TPCAM, based on traffic cameras to help in smooth vehicular movement on junctions and set to reduce the traffic congestion. Our traffic detection and pattern analysis model aims at detecting and calculating the traffic flux of vehicles and pedestrians at intersections in real-time. Our system can utilize one camera to capture all the traffic flows in one intersection instead of multiple cameras, which will reduce the infrastructure requirement and potential for easy deployment. We propose a new deep learning model based on YOLOv2 and adapt the model for the traffic detection scenarios. To reduce the network burdens and eliminate the deployment of network backbone at the intersections, we propose to process the traffic video data at the network edge without transmitting the big data back to the cloud. To improve the processing frame rate at the edge, we further propose deep object tracking algorithm leveraging adaptive multi-modal models and make it robust to object occlusions and varying lighting conditions. Based on the deep learning based detection and tracking, we can achieve pseudo-30FPS via adaptive key frame selection. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

UAVs, especially in the military domain, were initially used for gathering intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance data, and sending them to a command center. Their use was then expanded to the tactical level to perform military operations with manned platforms. Operating a UAV as a relay node in the air has many advantages, including coverage, recovery from disconnection from a relay, clear communication channel, and easy deployment. Thus, the UAV-Relay tactical network can support more effective military operations. However, reliable UAV control and situational awareness must be guaranteed for the use of tactical UAVs. In other words, all tactical nodes must be able to send their location and status periodically under the dynamic and unexpected situation of a battlefield. However, a jamming attack from the enemy can make UAV control and situational awareness impossible. Thus, we need a robust tactical data link (TDL) to guarantee reliable UAV control and situational awareness under a jamming attack. In this article, we first explain the requirements for reliable UAV control and situational awareness. We then design a future UAV-relay TDL, called link-situational awareness and control (Link-SAC), which satisfies the requirements. We also deal with the spectrum allocation and management of Link-SAC because Link-SAC requires large bandwidth under the scarcity of spectrum resource. Thus, we consider spectrum sharing to allocate an X-Band uplink to Link-SAC. Based on the interference analysis in a prior study, we show that spectrum sharing is possible. We also show how Link-SAC can manage the spectrum. Lastly, we present our concluding remarks. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Nevertheless, the directionality of mmWave communications and its susceptibility to blockage raise severe questions on the feasibility of mmWave vehicular communications. The dynamic nature of 5G vehicular scenarios, and the complexity of directional mmWave communication calls for higher context-awareness and adaptability. To this aim, we propose the first online learning algorithm addressing the problem of beam selection with environment-awareness in mmWave vehicular systems. In particular, we model this problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem. Next, we propose a lightweight context-aware online learning algorithm, namely FML, with proven performance bound and guaranteed convergence. FML exploits coarse user location information and aggregates received data to learn from and adapt to its environment.

Accordingly, an increasing number of applications have emerged based on UAVs. Among which, placing UAVs as Aerial Base Stations (ABSs) has received considerable interest in both the industrial and academic community. Existing solutions focus on the optimization of the UAV deployment problem for static user topology using the control information obtained from the Terrestrial Base Station (TBS), that makes hard for the controller to make real-time decisions. To break this stalemate, we propose a SemI-DistributEd system, named SIDE, for the UAV self-deployment. In SIDE, we introduce a mechanical equilibrium based approach, named EMech, via which the UAV positions are self-adapted according to users' attraction (e.g., user distance and traffic demand) within their transmission range. To facilitate the EMech, we propose a fine-grained area splitting strategy, termed KDivision, that partitions the service area in accordance with the user density. Finally, an area merging technique, namely RMerge, is exploited to approximately optimize the positions of the UAVs assisted by an Utility Function that strikes a balance amid the network performance and economic cost. We conduct field experiments to validate the feasibility of EMech. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed SIDE finds the optimal number of assigned UAVs, which not only reduces the cost of the system significantly, but also improves the achievable rate up to 74.6% compared to the existing solutions while consuming almost the same energy level. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

As vehicles are becoming smarter and connected, their risk of being compromised is increasing. On various occasions and venues, hacking into smart or autonomous vehicles have been shown to be possible. For most of the time, a compromised vehicle poses a threat to the driver and other vehicles. On the other hand, when the vehicle is electric, the attack may spread to the power grid infrastructure starting from the EV supply equipment (EVSE) all the way up to the utility systems. Traditional isolation-based protection schemes do not work well in smart grid since electricity services have availability constraints and few of the components have physical backups. In this paper, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model that jointly optimizes security risk and equipment availability in the interdependent power and EV infrastructure. We adopt an epidemic attack model to mimic malware propagation. We assume malware spreads during EV charging when an EV is charged from an infected EVSE and then travels and recharges at another EVSE. In addition, it spreads through the communication network of EVSEs. The proposed response model aims to isolate a subset of compromised and likely compromised EVSEs.

It is clear that in a similar scenario cybersecurity of modern and future vehicles is paramount. With connected autonomous vehicles the protection from external attack will be an essential requirement, motivated by the outstanding safety implications of an autonomous vehicles remotely controlled by an attacker or a malware. However, the automotive industry still lacks reliable and repeatable methods to assess the cybersecurity level of modern cars. This paper has a twofold contribution. First, it describes the ongoing effort of regulatory bodies within the European Union toward the definition of cybersecurity certification schemes. Second, it outlines the main requirements of a cybersecurity ranking approach that is suitable for certifying the security level of connected vehicles. Since improved cybersecurity guarantees will come at the expense of increased complexity and costs, the proposed ranking approach allows to assess whether the cybersecurity level is appropriate by considering the potential safety risks of a successful attack to the ranked system or subsystem. © 2018 AEIT.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Based on the fact that the wavelength of human body radiation falls around 9.3 μm, thermal images have distinctive advantages for pedestrian detection in the nighttime. With the recent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the vision community, how to properly explore information in color and thermal images using CNNs-based methods attracts the attention of researchers. Previous CNN-based multispectral pedestrian detectors focus on the design of network architectures. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, pixel-level image fusion are also extensively evaluated based on a state-of-the-art CNNs-based framework in the daytime and nighttime for pedestrian detection. Second, the effective strategies to combine pixel-level fusion methods and CNN-fusion architectures are studied based on extensive experimental results. Two combination strategies are designed and an exhaustive experimental analysis is performed to evaluate different combinations for all-day pedestrian detection. Extensive results based on a multispectral pedestrian benchmark show that some pixel-level image fusion methods can achieve similar or even better performance than CNN-fusion architectures, which emphasizes the importance of pixel-level fusion in CNN-based pedestrian detectors. The combination of both can usually more properly exploit multispectral information and further boost detection performance. © 2018","Article","Final","Scopus"

All of the Sentinel-1 GRD products generated before March 2018—more than 800,000—are affected by this particular type of noise. In March 2018, an official fix was deployed that solved the problem for a large portion of the newly generated products, but it did not cover the entire range of products, hence the need for an operational tool that is able to effectively and consistently remove border noise in an automated way. Currently, a few solutions have been proposed that try to address the problem, but all of them have limitations. The scope of this paper is therefore to present a new method based on mathematical morphology for the automatic detection and masking of border noise in Sentinel-1 GRD products that is able to overcome the existing limitations. To evaluate the performance of the method, a detailed numerical assessment was carried out, using, as a benchmark, the ‘Remove GRD Border Noise’ module integrated in ESA’s Sentinel Application Platform. The results showed that the proposed method is capable of very accurately removing the undesired noisy pixels from GRD images, regardless of their acquisition mode, polarization, or resolution and can cope with challenging features within the image scenes that typically affect other approaches. © 2018 by the authors.

Considering that the motion states of UAV might be influenced by some dynamic uncertainties, such as control strategies, flight environments, and any other bursting-out threats, we model the uncertain factors that might cause such influences to the path planning of the UAV, unified as an unobservable part of the system and take the acceleration together with the bank angle of the UAV as a control variable. Meanwhile, the cost function is chosen based on the tracking error, then the control instructions and flight path for UAV can be achieved. Then, the cost function can be optimized through Q-learning, and the best UAV action sequence for conflict avoidance under the moving threat environment can be obtained. According to Bellman's optimization principle, the optimal action strategies can be obtained from the current confidence level. The method in this paper is more in line with the actual UAV path planning, since the generation of the path planning strategy at each moment takes into account the influence of the UAV control strategy on its motion at the next moment. The simulation results show that all the planning paths that are created according to the solution framework proposed in this paper have a very high tracking accuracy, and this method has a much shorter processing time as well as a shorter path it can create. © 2018 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

With global coverage, high accuracy, and lightweight receivers, GNSS positioning has several desirable properties, especially on unmanned aerial systems (UAVs) with limited sensor payload capacity. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the GNSS signals the navigation signal is prone to malicious attacks, such as jammig or spoofing. In the last few years, alternative solutions for absolute positioning of unmanned vehicles have emerged. One example of this is positioning using a phased array radio systems (PARS). PARS equipment has the potential to provide position measurements that are accurate within tens of meters. The PARS solutions typically have significantly higher SNR and strongly encrypted messages, which makes them robust towards malicious attacks. This paper presents a method for an inertial navigation system which is aided using redundant position sensors. The high-accuracy RTK solution is the primary position reference, when it is available. The PARS is used to detect if GNSS solution is being spoofed (or jammed), and is used as the fall-back positioning solution. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The heart muscle damage produces changes in the recorded surface electrocardiogram (ECG). The identification of MI by visual inspection of the ECG requires expert interpretation, and is difficult as the ECG signal changes associated with MI can be short in duration and low in magnitude. Hence, errors in diagnosis can lead to delay the initiation of appropriate medical treatment. To lessen the burden on doctors, an automated ECG based system can be installed in hospitals to help identify MI changes on ECG. In the proposed study, we develop a single-channel single lead ECG based MI diagnostic system validated using noisy and clean datasets. The raw ECG signals are taken from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt database. We design a novel two-band optimal biorthogonal filter bank (FB) for analysis of the ECG signals. We present a method to design a novel class of two-band optimal biorthogonal FB in which not only the product filter but the analysis lowpass filter is also a halfband filter. The filter design problem has been composed as a constrained convex optimization problem in which the objective function is a convex combination of multiple quadratic functions and the regularity and perfect reconstruction conditions are imposed in the form linear equalities. ECG signals are decomposed into six subbands (SBs) using the newly designed wavelet FB. Following to this, discriminating features namely, fuzzy entropy (FE), signal-fractal-dimensions (SFD), and renyi entropy (RE) are computed from all the six SBs. The features are fed to the k-nearest neighbor (KNN). The proposed system yields an accuracy of 99.62% for the noisy dataset and an accuracy of 99.74% for the clean dataset, using 10-fold cross validation (CV) technique. Our MI identification system is robust and highly accurate. It can thus be installed in clinics for detecting MI. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we present a new large-scale database “Multi-Human Parsing (MHP)"" for algorithm development and evaluation, and advances the state-of-the-art in understanding humans in crowded scenes. MHP contains 25,403 elaborately annotated images with 58 fine-grained semantic category labels, involving 2-26 persons per image and captured in real-world scenes from various viewpoints, poses, occlusion, interactions and background. We further propose a novel deep Nested Adversarial Network (NAN) model for multi-human parsing. NAN consists of three Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-like sub-nets, respectively performing semantic saliency prediction, instance-agnostic parsing and instance-aware clustering. These sub-nets form a nested structure and are carefully designed to learn jointly in an end-to-end way. NAN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions on our MHP and several other datasets, and serves as a strong baseline to drive the future research for multi-human parsing. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

It has attracted attention in various applications such as 3D tele-presence, navigation for unmanned vehicles and heritage reconstruction. The understanding of point clouds, such as point cloud segmentation, is crucial in exploiting the informative value of point clouds for such applications. Due to the irregularity of the data format, previous deep learning works often convert point clouds to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images before feeding them into neural networks, which leads to voluminous data and quantization artifacts. In this paper, we instead propose a regularized graph convolutional neural network (RGCNN) that directly consumes point clouds. Leveraging on spectral graph theory, we treat features of points in a point cloud as signals on graph, and define the convolution over graph by Chebyshev polynomial approximation. In particular, we update the graph Laplacian matrix that describes the connectivity of features in each layer according to the corresponding learned features, which adaptively captures the structure of dynamic graphs. Further, we deploy a graph-signal smoothness prior in the loss function, thus regularizing the learning process. Experimental results on the ShapeNet part dataset show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the computational complexity while achieving competitive performance with the state of the art. Also, experiments show RGCNN is much more robust to both noise and point cloud density in comparison with other methods. We further apply RGCNN to point cloud classification and achieve competitive results on ModelNet40 dataset. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In a representative mission, this system should have the capability to generate collision-free trajectories from the AUVs' initial positions to desired goal positions while optimizing some mission specific performance metric. The trajectories must also satisfy different constraints imposed by environmental conditions, AUV dynamics, and underwater communication limitations. This calls for the availability of algorithms that can deal with a large number of constraints and complex cost functions. In this paper we address the cooperative motion planning problem for a group of AUVs with time, energy, and active navigation constraints. We focus on two challenging problems. In the first problem the trajectories should guide the AUVs to a desired formation with minimum energy consumption, while in the second the information content of the path should be maximized for accurate single-beacon AUV positioning. We formulate the problems as optimal control problems to explicitly address the objectives and constraints.

They are used for example in embedded systems such as UAV, e.g. for video processing. It is a challenge to design Autonomic Managers for such highly dynamic systems, taking into account the combina-torial design space of configurations and criteria and policies to decide on whether to reconfigure, and what next configuration to choose. In this paper, we propose a Domain Specific Language (DSL) called Ctrl-DPR, allowing designers to easily generate Autonomic Managers. They can describe their system and their management strategies, in terms of the entities composing the system: tasks, versions, applications, ressources, policies. The DSL relies on a behavioural modelling of these entities, targeted at the design of autonomic managers to control the reconfigurations in such a way as to enforce given policies and strategies. The models we use involve automata to describe the state space of configurations, and the transitions representing reconfigurations; they also involve discrete control techniques exploiting such models in order to obtain a correct runtime manager. These model-based control techniques are embedded in a compiler, connected to a reactive language and discrete controller synthesis tool, which enables to generate a C implementation of the controller enforcing the management strategies.

For an AVP system, parking reservation is an indispensable part so that vehicles can accomplish automated parking in accordance with the reserved parking information. However, the reservation requests may not only reveal the driver identity, but also disclose his/her sensitive locations, e.g., the most visited places, which are of great concerns to users. To deal with this challenge, the anonymous techniques can be naturally applied during parking reservation, but directly applying the anonymous techniques in AVP will introduce a new security issue, i.e., the anonymous user may maliciously crash the AVP system by repetitively sending the reservation requests, which is called 'double-reservation attack.' In this paper, we propose a new privacy-preserving reservation scheme for securing AVP system. Specifically, each anonymous user must have only one valid reservation token at any moment, and the token can only be used for booking one vacant parking space once. The proposed scheme does not only preserve the user's identity privacy and location privacy but also prevents the 'double-reservation attack' based on several elegant building blocks, i.e., zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge and proxy resignature. Detailed security analysis confirms the security properties of our proposed scheme.

Motion planning for safe stop differs from nominal motion planning, since there is not a specific goal location. Rather, the desired behavior is that the vehicle should reach a stopped state, preferably outside of active lanes. Also, the functionality to stop safely needs to be of high integrity. The first contribution of this paper is to formulate the safe stop problem as a benchmark optimal control problem, which can be solved by dynamic programming. However, this solution method cannot be used in real-time. The second contribution is to develop a real-time safe stop trajectory planning algorithm, based on selection from a precomputed set of trajectories. By exploiting the particular properties of the safe stop problem, the cardinality of the set is decreased, making the algorithm computationally efficient. Furthermore, a monitoring based architecture concept is proposed, that ensures dependability of the safe stop function. Finally, a proof of concept simulation using the proposed architecture and the safe stop trajectory planner is presented. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Various guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with PAD are available but they often lack a suffi cient evidence base for high-grade recommendations since randomized and controlled trials (RCT) remain rare or are frequently subject to confl icts of interest. This registry trial aims to evaluate the outcomes of catheter-based endovascular revascularisations vs. open-surgical endarterectomy vs. bypass surgery for symptomatic PAD on medical and patient-reported outcomes. Methods and design: The study is a prospective non-randomized multicentre registry trial including invasive revascularisations performed in 10 000 patients treated for symptomatic PAD at 30 to 40 German vascular centres. All patients matching the inclusion criteria are consecutively included for a recruitment period of six months (between May and December 2018) or until 10 000 patients have been included in the study registry. There are three follow-up measures at three, six, and 12 months. Automated completeness and plausibility checks as well as independent site visit monitoring will be performed to assure high internal and external validity of the study data. Study endpoints include relevant major cardiovascular and limb events and patient-reported outcomes from two Delphi studies with experts in vascular medicine and registry-based research. Discussion: It remains unclear if results from RCT can refl ect daily treatment practice. Furthermore, great costs and complexity make it challenging to accomplish high quality randomized trials in PAD treatment. Prospective registry-based studies to collect real-world evidence can help to overcome these limitations. © 2018 Hogrefe.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Once the initial position is available, the vehicle can start a mission immediately with accurate attitude, position and velocity information determined within ten minutes. This is achieved by two tightly coupled stages, that is, real-time Double-vector Attitude Determination Coarse Alignment (DADCA) and Backtracking Fine Alignment (BFA). In the DADCA process, the vehicle motion is omitted to roughly estimate the attitude at the very start of the alignment. Meanwhile, attitude quaternions and velocity increments are extracted and recorded. The BFA process utilises the stored data and exploits the Non-Holonomic Constraints (NHC) of a vehicle to obtain virtual velocity measurements. A linear SINS/NHC Kalman filter with mounting angles as extended states is constructed to improve the fine alignment accuracy. The method is verified by three vehicle tests, which shows that the accuracy of alignment azimuth is 0·0358° (Root Mean Square, RMS) and the positioning accuracy is about 15 m (RMS) at the end of the alignment. © The Royal Institute of Navigation 2018.","Article","Final","Scopus"

A higher percentage of heavy vehicles in the design lane increases the required load-bearing capacity of the pavement structure and therefore increases construction cost. This study considers three probable strategies to control this cost trend for flexible pavement: distribution of trucks across multiple lanes, design of heterogeneous pavement structures across lanes, and separation of car lanes from truck lanes. It was found that the construction cost of one unit length of highway is less for each strategy than the cost incurred with truck lane restriction in place. In order to take advantage of platooning, cars and trucks may not continue to use highway lanes in the traditional way. The cost advantages reported here can be exploited for selecting future highway lane management strategies in the environment of connected and autonomous vehicles. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this work, we explore the application of Faster R-CNN for pedestrian detection. We found that Faster R-CNN has not shown competitive results as we expected. The main challenges for Faster R-CNN may be small objects and hard negative examples. More interestingly, we found that when the RPN and the proposal classifier are trained separately and simply combined, the detection results can be significantly improved. Based on these observations, we designed a multi-map network and a multi-ROI network to solve these two problems. The multi-map network not only utilizes the convolutional feature maps output by last convolutional layer but also exploits the previous feature maps which have higher resolution but less semantic information. The multi-ROI network converts one bounding box to three bounding boxes including enlarged one, shrinking one and original one. Then, the network fuses the features of these three bounding boxes into one robust and discriminative feature. In addition to comparing these two networks with Faster R-CNN, we also merged them into one unified and end to end network called multi-ROI-map (MRM) network.

To deal with this threat, farmers resort to spraying the fields uniformly with herbicides. This method not only requires huge quantities of herbicides but impacts the environment and human health. One way to reduce the cost and environmental impact is to allocate the right doses of herbicide to the right place and at the right time (precision agriculture). Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming an interesting acquisition system for weed localization and management due to their ability to obtain images of the entire agricultural field with a very high spatial resolution and at a low cost. However, despite significant advances in UAV acquisition systems, the automatic detection of weeds remains a challenging problem because of their strong similarity to the crops. Recently, a deep learning approach has shown impressive results in different complex classification problems. However, this approach needs a certain amount of training data, and creating large agricultural datasets with pixel-level annotations by an expert is an extremely time-consuming task. In this paper, we propose a novel fully automatic learning method using convolutional neuronal networks (CNNs) with an unsupervised training dataset collection for weed detection from UAV images. The proposed method comprises three main phases. First, we automatically detect the crop rows and use them to identify the inter-row weeds. In the second phase, inter-row weeds are used to constitute the training dataset. Finally, we perform CNNs on this dataset to build a model able to detect the crop and the weeds in the images. The results obtained are comparable to those of traditional supervised training data labeling, with differences in accuracy of 1.5% in the spinach field and 6% in the bean field. © 2018 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, an extended RTK positioning for significant height differences between two low-cost GNSS receivers with patch antennas is presented. In this case, the classical model for double difference measurements needs to be extended, i.e., a differential tropospheric zenith delay and pseudorange multipath errors need to be estimated besides the baseline and carrier phase integer ambiguities. The increased number of unknowns results in an ill-conditioned system of observation equations and a substantial correlation between the state estimates. We introduce prior information on the differential tropospheric zenith delay based on the differential air pressure and exploit the temporal correlation of pseudorange multipath errors. Moreover, a criterion for the integer ambiguity candidate vector selection is provided, which is robust over phase multipath and unavoidable errors in the float ambiguity covariance matrix. The proposed method is validated with two low-cost GNSS modules that were placed at the Zugspitzplatt (2601 m a.s.l.) and Eibsee (1018 m a.s.l.). The obtained estimates for the baseline and differential tropospheric zenith delay show a high repeatability over several independent ambiguity fixings. The residuals of the fixed carrier phase measurements are within 2 cm for almost all satellites, which confirms both the measurement model and the ambiguity fixing. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

One crash scenario which deserves special attention is driver's overtaking of cyclists since it has an increased likelihood to lead to severe injuries. During the overtaking manoeuvre, the monitoring of subjective risk can influence the decision-making process and lead to different outcomes. In this context, the present driving simulator study aims to investigate how the time to collision between oncoming traffic and subject vehicle affected the overtaking strategy, and the minimum safety margins towards the overtaken cyclist. The results show that a decrease in time to collision against the oncoming vehicle significantly affects the drivers’ overtaking strategy (accelerative vs. flying), inducing more drivers to choose an accelerative overtaking manoeuvre. The decrease in time to collision also produces a decrease in minimum safety margins to the cyclists for drivers who opt for a flying overtaking strategy. Finally, the current research shows that the minimum lateral safety margins were smaller and the mean speed higher in flying manoeuvres compared to accelerative manoeuvres. Overall, the combination of lower safety margins and higher mean speeds in flying overtaking manoeuvres seems to pose a risk for cyclists’ safety. The findings of the study provide some implications for the design of automated driving. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

This includes fishermen, tourists and other victims who visit beaches, rivers or lakes for recreational purposes. Though well-versed swimmers can struggle for a while, if sufficient aid does not reach them at the required time it could be disastrous. Although coastal lines have lifeguards, they are not able to approach the drowning person immediately which results in a mishap.

In the automotive field, including connected vehicles, different types of connected services have become available and they provide convenience and comfort with users while yielding new business opportunities. With the advent of connected vehicles, the threat of cyber attacks has become a serious issue and protection methods against these attacks are urgently needed to provide safe and secure connected services. From 2017, attack methods have become more sophisticated through different attack surfaces attached to navigation systems and telematics modules, and security requirements to circumvent such attacks have begun to be established. Individual threats have been addressed previously; however, there are few reports that provide an overview of cyber security related to connected vehicles. This paper gives our perspective on cyber security for connected vehicles based on a survey of recent studies related to vehicle security. To introduce these studies, the environment surrounding connected vehicles is classified into three categories: Inside the vehicle, communications between the back-end systems and vehicles, and the back-end systems. In each category, this paper introduces recent trends in cyber attacks and the protection requirements that should be developed for connected services. We show that the overall security covering the three categories must be considered because the security of the vehicle is jeopardized even if one item in the categories is not covered. We believe that this paper will further contribute to development of all service systems related to connected vehicles including autonomous vehicles and to the investigation into cyber security against these attacks. © 2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Even though there has been significant amount of work on obstacle detection and avoidance using LiDAR and camera data, there has not been much effort focusing on providing a lightweight, cost conscious, energy efficient, reliable, and portable solution for the visually impaired. We propose a new method for autonomous obstacle detection and classification, which incorporates a different and novel type of sensor, namely, patterned light field, with camera. The proposed device is small in size, easily carried, as well as low cost. The grid, projected by the patterned light source, is apparent and differentiable as the sensing system is hand carried in natural indoor and outdoor environments over and toward different types of obstacles. Our proposed approach exploits these patterns, without calibration, by employing deep learning techniques, including a convolutional neural network-based classification on individual frames. We further refine our approach by smoothing the frame-based classifications over multiple frames using long short-term memory units. The proposed method provides very promising results with overall detection and classification accuracies of 98.37% for the binary case as well as 95.97% and 92.62% for two different multi-class scenarios.

The construction of 5G network brings a new direction of detecting, identifying, and managing UAVs based on the native cloud architecture. In 5G end-to-end network slices, rotor UAVs are detected and identified by deploying 5G millimeter waves and using a joint algorithm, the improved short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and based on Bessel function base. For one-rotor UAV, the use of STFT following conjugation of sinusoidal frequency modulation (SFM) radar echo data based on millimeter wave doubles the recognition effect compared with the unconjugated processing. For multi-rotors UAV, the number of rotors and the length and rotational speed of each rotor are effectively identified through projection on the SFM data and the introduction of k order Bessel function. According to the results of automatic identification of UAVs by 5G native cloud architecture, the high bandwidth and low delay of 5G network provide a reliable basis for the resolution. Because of good robustness of the Bessel function, it provides an effective solution for the detection, identification and management of UAVs by 5G millimeter wave radar. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

It allows vehicles to travel in a convoy manner, very close to each other with constant speeds and gaps. It uses Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) as the underlying communication framework. These are a type of network with a set of very specific characteristics, making it an easy target for attackers. Frequent disconnections, topology change, communication over the air among others, create vulnerabilities easily exploitable. The goal of this paper is to present how to secure the communication between the several nodes of a platooningby using an existing security model. After a careful research and evaluation, the Vehicular Ad hoc Network Public Key Infrastructure and Attribute Based Encryption with Identity Manager Hybrid (VPKIbrID) model was chosen. It provides a whole solution with tools for secure message exchange and entity authentication. The impact of the introduced security model was evaluated using simulations with different platoon sizes and VPKIbrID modes. The several operations of the platoon will be carried using the Platoon Management Protocol (PMP). The result analysis allowed to verify that when using a VPKIbrID mode that allows multicast/broadcast communications, the vehicles sent much fewer messages than the mode that only supports unicast. The performance results indicate that the vehicles should use VPKIbrid Public Key Infrastructure (VPKIbrID-PKI) for maneuvers and VPKIbrid Attribute Base Encryption (VPKIbrID-ABE) to exchange platoon beacons or any message exchanged to all platoon members. Moreover, the messages broadcasted in a platoon group will always have the same targets, with the same attributes, being a perfect use case for the usages of cached keys. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

These systems also often need to protect their critical program information (CPI) from adversarial interference and intellectual property theft. Trusted execution environments (TEE) execute CPI tasks on a special-purpose processor, thus providing hardware protection. However, adapting a system written to execute in environments without TEE requires partitioning the code into the regular and trusted parts. This process involves complex manual program transformations that are not only laborious and intellectually tiresome, but also hard to validate and verify for the adherence to real-time constraints. To address these problems, this paper presents novel program analyses and transformation techniques, accessible to the developer via a declarative meta-programming model. The developer declaratively specifies the CPI portion of the system. A custom static analysis checks CPI specifications for validity, while probe-based profiling helps identify whether the transformed system would continue to meet the original real-time constraints, with a feedback loop suggesting how to modify the code, so its CPI can be isolated. Finally, an automated refactoring isolates the CPI portion for TEE-based execution, communicated with through generated calls to the TEE API. We have evaluated our approach by successfully enabling the trusted execution of the CPI portions of several microbenchmarks and a drone autopilot. Our approach shows the promise of declarative meta-programming in reducing the programmer effort required to adapt systems for trusted execution under real-time constraints. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

With the wide-spread usage of DL in critical and time-sensitive applications, including unmanned vehicles, drones, and video surveillance systems, online detection of malicious inputs is of utmost importance. We propose DeepFense, the first end-to-end automated framework that simultaneously enables efficient and safe execution of DL models. DeepFense formalizes the goal of thwarting adversarial attacks as an optimization problem that minimizes the rarely observed regions in the latent feature space spanned by a DL network. To solve the aforementioned minimization problem, a set of complementary but disjoint modular redundancies are trained to validate the legitimacy of the input samples in parallel with the victim DL model. DeepFense leverages hardware/software/algorithm co-design and customized acceleration to achieve just-in-time performance in resource-constrained settings. The proposed countermeasure is unsupervised, meaning that no adversarial sample is leveraged to train modular redundancies. We further provide an accompanying API to reduce the non-recurring engineering cost and ensure automated adaptation to various platforms. Extensive evaluations on FPGAs and GPUs demonstrate up to two orders of magnitude performance improvement while enabling online adversarial sample detection. © 2018 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In the field of connectivity, vehicular networks are constructed to manage communications among nearby vehicles and between vehicles and road-side infrastructure units and trusted agencies or certificate authorities. The above cooperative systems applications bring the promise of improved road safety and optimised road traffic. For the successful deployment of vehicular communications (VCs), it is essential to make sure that 'life-critical safety' information cannot be modified by external or internal within the network attackers. On this basis, lack of such security and privacy in vehicular networks is one of the key hindrances to the widespread implementations of connected-autonomous-driving applications. Moreover, specific operational parameters (highly moving vehicles, frequently and fast changed connectivity) make the problem very novel and challenging.

Worldwide more than 1.3 billion of people are living off-grid, often in developing regions of high insect biodiversity. In developed countries, dark refuges for wildlife are threatened by ornamental garden lights. Solar powered LEDs (SPLEDs) are cheaply available, dim, and often used to illuminate foot paths, but little is known on their effects on ground living (epigeal) arthropods. We used off-the-shelf garden lamps with a single ‘white’ LED (colour temperature 7250 K) to experimentally investigate effects on attraction and nocturnal activity of ground beetles (Carabidae). We found two disparate and species-specific effects of SPLEDs. (i) Some nocturnal, phototactic species were not reducing activity under illumination and were strongly attracted to lamps (>20-fold increase in captures compared to dark controls). Such species aggregate in lit areas and SPLEDs may become ecological traps, while the species is drawn from nearby, unlit assemblages. (ii) Other nocturnal species were reducing mobility and activity under illumination without being attracted to light, which may cause fitness reduction in lit areas. Both reactions offer mechanistic explanations on how outdoor illumination can change population densities of specific predatory arthropods, which may have cascading effects on epigeal arthropod assemblages. The technology may thus increase the area of artificial light at night (ALAN) impacting insect biodiversity. Measures are needed to mitigate effects, such as adjustment of light colour temperature and automated switch-offs. © 2018 The Authors.

In autonomous racing the superior goal is to reduce the time necessary to drive a lap. Using rear axle steering gives additional actuation to enhance the vehicle's capabilities up to the tire friction limits and to further reduce the laptime. This paper presents a comparison of a production car to a car with an additional rear axle steering on the basis of a racing line optimization and the resulting laptime. The benefits of this additional actuation are outlined, coming from an increasing vehicle dynamics potential and from an adaptive placement on the track. Different models are taken into account during racing line optimization to compare them and discuss their influence on the results. It is shown, that a simplified vehicle dynamics model gives a suitable approximation of the optimal racing line compared to a simple lumped mass model. Furthermore, the rear axle steered car is less sensitive on modeling simplifications in comparison to the standard car. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Smart cars are one of the technologies which make our lives easier, but if an attacker exploits its vulnerabilities, they can cause severe discomfort to the passengers and the people around. In recent years, there have been instances where Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) were attacked by hackers, which granted complete and total control of the car to the attacker, or where the network was jammed, which led to the loss of information. In this paper, we present the simulation of a DDoS attack in a virtual environment of OMNET++ on a network of connected autonomous/smart cars.

This brief presents an optimization-based method to calculate such trajectories for autonomous vehicles operating in an uncertain environment with moving obstacles. The proposed approach applies to linear system models, as well as to a particular class of nonlinear models, including industrially relevant vehicles, such as autonomous guided vehicles with front wheel, differential wheel, and rear-wheel steering. The method computes smooth motion trajectories, satisfying the vehicle's kinematics, by using a spline parameterization. Furthermore, it exploits spline properties to keep the resulting nonlinear optimization problem small scale and to guarantee constraint satisfaction, without the need for time gridding. The resulting problem is solved sufficiently fast for online motion planning, dealing with uncertainties and changes in the environment. This brief demonstrates the potential of the method with extensive numerical simulations. In addition, it presents an experimental validation in which a KUKA youBot, steered as a holonomic or differential drive vehicle, drives through an environment with moving obstacles.

In addition, this topic has received significant attention recently. This work proposes techniques that exploit the role of color spaces for addressing two important challenges in relation to salient object detection. The autonomous identification of a color space by which to carry out the processing has always been of prime importance to most image analysis tasks and this is equally so in relation to saliency detection. To address this challenge, a new adaptive color space selection method is proposed, here, which autonomously identifies the color space that is locally the most appropriate for saliency detection on an image by image basis. The color channels within this identified local color space are aggregated using joint l2, 1-norm minimization in order to determine feature importance and also to achieve feature selection leaning. A process relevant to saliency detection is multi-modality feature fusion, in which multiple features and color spaces are used in combination to capture the saliency aspects of an image/region. To implement this second process, a new technique for the region based optimal combination of feature modalities is introduced. The results of the rigorous experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive color space selection and also for the region based optimal combination methods in comparison to 13 other state-of-the-art saliency methods and all in relation to three benchmark datasets. The efficacy of the proposed color space selection and region based combination methods is further validated by examining their ability to select appropriate color spaces for, and successfully aggregate the results of, up to five benchmark methods. © 2018","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, ATM machines are also vulnerable to attacks when they are unattended during non-office hours and public holidays. Recently, many ATM machines were reported being removed from the premises or damaged using various methods in order to steal the cash inside. Due to this reason, many ATM sites are actually equipped with video surveillance systems to monitor the environment for crime prevention. However, it is difficult for security personnel to pin-point the crime scene in real time when the number of surveillance cameras increases. In this paper, a real time security expert video surveillance system was proposed to detect the suspicious behaviour by utilizing image processing techniques. The proposed expert system, hereafter referred to as ArchCam, is capable in detecting suspicious behaviours that attempt to remove or attack the ATM machines and provide early warning to the centralized video surveillance system. The suspicious behaviour that ArchCam detects include squatting/climbing (attempt to remove security alarm system or place a bomb) and carrying “belt shape” object (attempt to remove the ATM). The squatting/climbing activity is detected through novel technique to estimate the height of the moving object(s) in front of ATM. On the other hand, the “belt shape” object is detected through estimation of object width by using region splitting and merging technique. With the intelligence of detecting suspicious behaviour, the proposed expert system can effectively alert the security personnel to take proactive actions before the cash is being robbed from the ATM machines. This greatly reduces the effort for security personnel as they only need to observe the camera videos with suspicious behaviour, which on the other hand help to improve the possibility of detecting actual crime scene in real time. ArchCam was implemented in an embedded system with GPU platform and has been verified in a simulated ATM setup with good detection accuracy and fast computational timing performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this regard, the functional safety standard, ISO 26262, was drafted with the intention of minimizing risk due to random hardware faults or systematic failure in design of electrical and electronic components of an automobile. However, growing complexity of a modern car has added another potential point of failure in the form of cyber or sensor attacks. Recently, researchers have demonstrated that vulnerability in vehicle's software or sensing units could enable them to remotely alter the intended operation of the vehicle. As such, in addition to safety, security should be considered as an important design goal. However, designing security solutions without the consideration of safety objectives could result in potential hazards. Consequently, in this paper we propose the notion of security for safety and show that by integrating safety conditions with our system-level security solution, which comprises of a modified Kalman filter and a Chi-squared detector, we can prevent potential hazards that could occur due to violation of safety objectives during an attack. Furthermore, with the help of a car-following case study, where the follower car is equipped with an adaptive-cruise control unit, we show that our proposed system-level security solution preserves the safety constraints and prevent collision between vehicle while under sensor attack. © 2018 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The primary goal here is to provide various support services to help the patients to maintain an active life and dignity. Assuming there are cost and resource limitations for delivering care within the system, where each care provider can support a limited number of patients, the problem can be defined as finding a set of suitable care providers with a minimum overall cost to match the needs of the maximum number of patients. In the grand scheme, the whole care system can be seen as a social network consisting of patients and care providers. This representation provides an opportunity to apply social network analysis techniques to enhance the topology of the system and improve its efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel computational agent-based model to address this problem by extending the agent's capabilities using the benefits of the social network. We assume that each patient agent can cover its disabilities and perform its desired tasks through collaboration with other agents. The primary objective is to optimize a dynamic, personalized care pathway system that will support palliative care within a community eco-system. Testing the ability of the system to match social support agents with personal preferences, needs, and capabilities is the second goal of this research work. In addition, we are going to measure the impact of the system on perceived quality of life, social connectedness, caregiver burden, and care satisfaction.

Here, one aims to compute the backward reachable set (BRS) or tube (BRT) - the set of states from which the system can be driven into a target set at a particular time or within a time interval, respectively. The computational complexity of current approaches scales poorly, making application to high-dimensional systems intractable. We propose a technique that decomposes the dynamics of a general class of nonlinear systems into subsystems which may be coupled through common states, controls, and disturbances. Despite this coupling, BRSs and BRTs can be computed efficiently using our technique without incurring additional approximation errors and without the need for linearizing dynamics or approximating sets as polytopes. Computations of BRSs and BRTs now become orders of magnitude faster, and for the first time BRSs and BRTs for many high-dimensional nonlinear control systems can be computed using the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. In situations involving bounded adversarial disturbances, our proposed method can obtain slightly conservative results. We demonstrate our theory by numerically computing BRSs and BRTs for several systems, including the six-dimensional Acrobatic Quadrotor using the HJ formulation. © 2018 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Visual odometry/SLAM methods have proven capable to achieve good results, even in real-time applications by operating in a sparse mode. Running on a sequence, these methods need to continuously incorporate new features well distributed over the image. Therefore, the performance of these methods can be further improved, if they are supplied with coarse but dense initial depth information, that can be utilized at arbitrary sparse image positions. Previously triangulated depths and even high quality depth measurements of a LIDAR sensor are not suitable for this task, since they only provide a sparse depth map. To solve this issue, we introduce a novel interpolation method called Spatio-Temporal Depth Interpolation (STDI), which exploits spatial and temporal correlations of the data (e.g. sequences of sparse depth maps) to give a consistent dense output including associated uncertainties. STDI is a fused approach, which makes use of the most important components of a principal component analysis (PCA) (spatial information) and additionally is capable to re-use information of previously interpolated depth maps in a regression based approach (temporal information). We evaluate the quality of STDI on the KITTI visual odometry benchmark, where a sequence of extremely sparsely sampled depth maps (≈40 depth values) is densified and on the KITTI depth completion benchmark. The latter deals with the densification of sparse LIDAR input. Of course, our method is not limited to these applications and can be used for any densification of sparse sequential data which is expected to contain spatial and/or temporal correlations (e.g. initialization for dense optical flow methods based on a sparse measurement). © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Furthermore, we adopt a reliable metric to measure the reliability of a patch. Kalman filter is used to fuse the holistic model and part model tracking results smoothly according to the metric.

However, unlike in the IT world, safety hazards and cybersecurity threats converge in cyber-physical systems; a malicious party can exploit cyber-threats to create extremely hazardous situations, whether in autonomous vehicles or nuclear plants. The authors propose a framework for integrated system-level analyses for functional safety and cyber security. They present a generic model named Threat Identification and Refinement for Cyber-Physical Systems (TIRCPS) extending Microsoft's six classes of threat modelling including Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial-of-Service and Elevation Privilege. TIRCPS introduces three benefits of developing complex systems: first, it allows the refinement of abstract threats into specific ones as physical design information becomes available. Second, the approach provides support for constructing attack trees with traceability from high-level goals and hazardous events (HEs) to threats. Third, TIRCPS formalises the definition of threats such that intelligent tools can be built to automatically detect most of a system's vulnerable components requiring protection. They present a case study on an automated-driving system to illustrate the proposed approach. The analysis results of a hierarchical attack tree with cyber-threats traceable to high-level HEs are used to design mitigation solutions. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018","Article","Final","Scopus"

These security threats have led to the development of different static as well as adaptive detection and protection techniques on different layers of the CPS stack, e.g., cross-layer and intra-layer connectivity. This paper first presents a brief overview of various security threats at different CPS layers, their respective threat models and associated research challenges to develop robust security measures. Moreover, this paper provides a brief yet comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art static and adaptive techniques for detection and prevention, and their inherent limitations, i.e., incapability to capture the dormant or uncertainty-based runtime security attacks. To address these challenges, this paper also discusses the intelligent security measures (using machine learning-based techniques) against several characterized attacks on different layers of the CPS stack. Furthermore, we identify the associated challenges and open research problems in developing intelligent security measures for CPS.

Depending on the nonlinear system dynamics, the candidate Lyapunov function and the set of states of interest, verifying stability requires solving complex, possibly non-convex or infeasible optimization problems. To avoid such problems, the proposed approach firstly distributes the verification of Lyapunov's inequality on a finite sampling of a bounded set of states of interest. Secondly, it extends the validity of Lyapunov's inequality to an infinite, bounded set of states by automatically exploiting local continuity properties. A sampling-based method for estimating the domain of attraction (DOA) via level sets of a validated Lyapunov function is also presented. Efficient state-space exploration is achieved using multi-resolution sampling and hyper-rectangles as basic sampling blocks. The operations that need to be performed for each sampling point in the state-space can be carried out in parallel, which improves scalability. The proposed methodology is illustrated for various benchmark examples from the literature. © 2018 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

There is a special need for using such platforms in case of operations in such backlands as Antarctica, because very often the equipment necessary for preparing improvised airfields near Antarctic scientific bases and organizing the UAV flights must be hand-carried. The main aim of this paper is to present the design activity and testing of a number of UAV configurations to be used for aerial monitoring in Antarctic areas and collecting data of local ecosystems. Two UAV flying-wing platforms – MONICA-1 and MONICA-2 – were developed, differing largely with respect to wing-loading and weight-to-power ratios. The light-weight Skywalker X-8 built from the kit and used as a baseline configuration was adapted for special photogrammetric missions. It was found that the main advantage of such light UAV consists in a very simple take-off system (i.e. bungee), however due to low wing loading a usage of this UAV is limited to the so-called ‘weather windows’ of relatively low wind, which do not frequently occur in Antarctica. MONICA-1 is much less sensitive to gust but as a heavy platform it is more difficult to handle in harsh Antarctic environment. To be able to operate in much wider range of the wind, vertical gust and heavy turbulence, typical for Antarctic zones, a special UAV platform – called MONICA-2 – was designed and manufactured. MONICA-2 platform of higher wing loading is smaller than the X-8 and at the same time is able to carry the same photogrammetry equipment. The effort of designers focused on achieving low sensitivity to gust and turbulence by increasing the critical angle of attack and natural static and dynamic stability in the whole range of operational speeds. The paper contains the selected design details and some observations from the flight tests. © IMechE 2018.","Article","Final","Scopus"

With more and more application and autonomy left to deep learning based artificial intelligence, humans want to ensure that the machine does the best for them under their control. However, deep learning algorithms are known to be vulnerable to carefully crafted input known as adversarial examples which makes it possible for an attacker to fool an AI system. In this work, we explored the mechanism behind the YOLO object detector and proposed an optimization method to craft adversarial examples to attack the YOLO model. The experiment shows that this white box attack method is effective and has a success rate of 100% in crafting digital adversarial examples to fool the YOLO model. We also proposed a robust physical adversarial sticker generation method based on an extended Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) method(a method to craft adversarial example in the physical world).

We carried out a field experiment to explore the possibility of tuning a well-known, low-cost acoustic radar (sodar), commonly used in atmospheric physics, to detect and track consumer drones. The vertical position of a small drone retrieved by a single-sodar antenna turned out to be in good agreement with that measured by its onboard GPS (correlation coefficient 0.93), and no significant bias was observed.

This article addresses an important aspect of refueling in the context of routing multiple small UAVs to complete a surveillance or data collection mission. Specifically, this article formulates a multiple-UAV routing problem with the refueling constraint of minimizing the overall fuel consumption for all the vehicles as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem with uncertainty associated with the fuel consumption of each vehicle. The two-stage model allows for the application of sample average approximation (SAA). Although the SAA solution asymptotically converges to the optimal solution for the two-stage model, the SAA run time can be prohibitive for medium-and large-scale test instances. Hence, we develop a tabu search-based heuristic that exploits the model structure while considering the uncertainty in fuel consumption. Extensive computational experiments corroborate the benefits of the two-stage model compared to a deterministic model and the effectiveness of the heuristic for obtaining high-quality solutions. © 2018 by the authors.

Participants (n = 49) completed trait questionnaires, the Decision Specific Reinvestment Scale, the Movement Specific Reinvestment Scale and Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. They realized the automated span task, which tests working memory, under counterbalanced LP and HP conditions. Cardiac vagal activity measurements were taken at rest, task and post task for 5 min, along with self-reported ratings of stress. Upon completion of the task, self-report measures of motivation, stress appraisal, attention and perceived pressure were completed. Current findings suggest cardiac vagal activity at rest can predict cardiac vagal activity under pressure, decision reinvestment influences cardiac vagal activity in cognitive tasks under LP and working memory performance is predicted by task cardiac vagal activity in HP only.

Here, similar to the design of access links, mmWave backhaul connections must also address many challenges such as multipath propagation and dynamic link blockage, which calls for advanced solutions to improve their reliability. To address these challenges, 3GPP New Radio technology is considering a flexible and reconfigurable backhaul architecture, which includes dynamic link rerouting to alternative paths. In this paper, we investigate the use of aerial relay nodes carried by e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to allow for such dynamic routing, while mitigating the impact of occlusions on the terrestrial links. This novel concept requires an understanding of mmWave backhaul dynamics that accounts for: 1) realistic 3-D multipath mmWave propagation; 2) dynamic blockage of mmWave backhaul links; and 3) heterogeneous mobility of blockers and UAV-based assisting relays. We contribute the required mathematical framework that captures these phenomena to analyze the mmWave backhaul operation in characteristic urban environments. We also utilize this framework for a new assessment of mmWave backhaul performance by studying its spatial and temporal characteristics. We finally quantify the benefits of utilizing UAV assistance for more reliable mmWave backhaul.

A constraint reference frame combining the kinematic model of constant acceleration (CA) is developed to solve the problem of arrival point generation. Second, by analyzing the relative motion between the UCAV and the moving objects, we define the situation space and give the corresponding calculation method. In tracking the moving target, the guidance vector contains the fusion information of displacement and velocity. At the same time, taking advantage of the one-step situation space as the judgment of the threat, we further plan the collision avoidance strategy. Third, as the safety in a practically reachable trajectory of the UCAV possesses the absolute priority, the collision avoidance acceleration accounts for this dominant factor in path planning. Simulations and experimental results prove that the proposed approach can plan a smooth and flyable path in 0.008 s under the premise of soft-landing target tracking. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In most of the short- and medium-range applications, Wi-Fi is used as the access technology for establishing communication between the ground stations and the UAVs. Although Wi-Fi is known to perform well in most of the scenarios, it is important to note that Wi-Fi has been mainly designed for indoor communication in rich scattering environments, whereas the air-to-ground (A2G) channel is characterized by sparse scattering. Considering this important difference in the channel characteristics, we revisit some of the Wi-Fi features and propose efficient design alternatives. First, we provide a statistical model for the sparse A2G channel and design an optimal time-domain quantizer (TDQ) for its feedback. In contrast to the frequency-domain quantizer (FDQ) of the IEEE 802.11n/ac Standard, the proposed TDQ exploits the time-domain sparsity in the channel and requires about 15 times lesser quantization bits than FDQ. Second, we propose a beamforming (BF) scheme with the aid of full-diversity rotation (FDR) matrices and analytically evaluate its symbol error probability in order to quantify the attainable diversity order. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed FDR-BF scheme outperforms the relevant benchmark schemes in both coded as well as uncoded scenarios. Specifically, the proposed FDR-BF scheme was observed to attain a signal-to-noise ratio gain as high as 6dB compared with the popular geometric mean decomposition-based BF scheme, when operating at an elevation angle of 7.5°. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Formation reconfiguration was inevitable during the flight when the mission was adjusted or the environment varied. Taking the typical formation reconfiguration from a triangular penetrating formation to a circular tracking formation for example, a path planning method based on Dubins trajectory and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented in this paper. The mathematic model of multiple UAVs formation reconfiguration was built firstly. According to the kinematic model of aerial vehicles, a process of dimensionality reduction was carried out to simplify the model based on Dubins trajectory. The PSO algorithm was adopted to resolve the optimization problem of formation reconfiguration path planning. Finally, the simulation and vehicles flight experiment are executed. Results show that the path planning method based on the Dubins trajectory and the PSO algorithm can generate feasible paths for vehicles on time, to guarantee the rapidity and effectiveness of formation reconfigurations. Furthermore, from the simulation results, the method is universal and could be extended easily to the path planning problem for different kinds of formation reconfigurations. © 2018, Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

A nonlinear six-degrees-of-freedom dynamic model that covers the full angle-of-attack range is derived using the component breakdown approach. The environmental model is further introduced in the real-time simulation application to provide prevailing and gust wind conditions.

We found copepods in the SML even during high exposure to sun-derived ultraviolet radiation and their abundance was significantly correlated to increased algal biomass. We additionally investigated the significance of the pontellids’ blue pigmentation and found that the reflectance peak of the blue pigment matched the water-leaving spectral radiance of the ocean surface.

Though robotic skin with embedded pressure or temperature sensors has received recent attention, robotic chemical sensors have long been unnoticed due to the challenges associated with realizing chemical sensing modalities on robotic platforms. For realizing such chemically sensitive robotic skin, we exploit here the recent advances in wearable chemical sensor technology and flexible electronics, and describe chemical sensing robotic fingers for rapid screening of food flavors and additives. The stretchable taste-sensing finger electrochemical devices are printed on the robotic glove, which simulates the soft skin, and are integrated with a wireless electronic board for real-time data transmission. The printed middle, index, and ring robotic fingers allow accurate discrimination between sweetness, sourness, and spiciness, via direct electrochemical detection of glucose, ascorbic acid, and capsaicin. The sweet-sensing ability has been coupled with a caffeine-sensing robotic finger for rapid screening of the presence of sugar and caffeine in common beverages. The ""sense of taste"" chemically sensitive robotic technology thus enables accurate discrimination between different flavors, as was illustrated in numerous tests involving a wide range of liquid and solid food samples.

Background: Securing driver engagement—by mitigating irony of automation (i.e., the better the automation, the less attention drivers will pay to traffic and the system, and the less capable they will be to resume control) and by communicating system limitations to avoid mental model misconceptions—is a major challenge in the human factors literature. Method: One hundred six drivers participated in three test-track experiments in which we studied driver intervention response to conflicts after driving highly reliable but supervised automation. After 30 min, a conflict occurred wherein the lead vehicle cut out of lane to reveal a conflict object in the form of either a stationary car or a garbage bag. Results: Supervision reminders effectively maintained drivers’ eyes on path and hands on wheel. However, neither these reminders nor explicit instructions on system limitations and supervision responsibilities prevented 28% (21/76) of drivers from crashing with their eyes on the conflict object (car or bag). Conclusion: The results uncover the important role of expectation mismatches, showing that a key component of driver engagement is cognitive (understanding the need for action), rather than purely visual (looking at the threat), or having hands on wheel. Application: Automation needs to be designed either so that it does not rely on the driver or so that the driver unmistakably understands that it is an assistance system that needs an active driver to lead and share control. © 2018, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Namely, we show that incorporating crystals of the flexible MOF MIL-88A into a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) matrix affords a polymer composite film that undergoes reversible shape transformations upon exposure to polar solvents and vapours. Since the self-folding properties of this film correlate directly with the swelling properties of the MIL-88A crystals, it selectively bends to certain solvents and its degree of folding can be controlled by controlling the relative humidity. Moreover, it shows a shape-memory effect at relative humidity values from 60 % to 90 %. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that these composite films can lift cargo and can be used to assemble 3D structures from 2D patterns.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) can be emitted by anthropogenic sources as the result of the incomplete combustion of organic matter and fossil fuels and they represent an important risk for human health under poor air quality conditions. High concentrations of PAHs have been linked with cancer and other respiratory diseases. Particle-bound PAHs (PPAHs) have been previously studied in Mexico City; however, their temporal scales are not fully understood given the short sampling periods (no more than five weeks) during which time they were evaluated. Recent automated and continuous measurements of PPAH concentration made in Mexico City during one full year (April 2016 to March 2017) show an average PPAH concentration of 31.7 ± 29.9 ng m−3 at the sampling location. The highest concentrations were observed in the winter corresponding to the cold dry season. On a daily basis, the maximum concentrations were observed between 06:00 and 11:00 am, as high as 495 ng m−3. The average PPAHs levels measured in the spring of 2016 were found to be ca. 150% higher than those that were measured 13 years previously in the spring of 2003, in approximately the same location and with the same equipment. A conceptual model is introduced to explain the primary processes behind the daily evolution of PPAHs that are produced from primary emissions but whose concentrations decrease due to evaporation and dilution with rising temperatures. Given the lack of instrumentation to measure PPAH at most air quality monitoring stations, a proxy is developed based upon correlations with the concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrous oxides (NOx), which are typically measured at urban monitoring stations worldwide and that are co-emitted with PAHs. An example application of parametrizations with this proxy suggest that people living in the North and Northwest of Mexico City are at greater health risk given that in these locations the PPAH concentrations are expected to be higher than in the rest of the city. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

Accurate diagnosis is important to direct treatment that may include chronic medication. Burden quantification and treatment monitoring are key in the effective care of patients with gout. This review highlights the positive impact of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) on the evaluation of gout patients and discusses common imaging artifacts that limit this imaging modality. Recent Findings: DECT has become the most accurate imaging method for confirming or excluding gout. Of note, however, it has reduced sensitivity in early disease, including initial attacks. Burden quantification is another important role of DECT, which can now be performed using automated software methods, allowing for a more reliable assessment of treatment effect. However, the analysis of gout DECT images can be impeded by artifacts related to the DECT reconstruction technique. Summary: DECT is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for diagnosis, burden quantification, and treatment monitoring in patients with gout. A working knowledge of common DECT artifacts is essential for mitigating their occurance and misinterpretation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Review","Final","Scopus"

Three different designs are selected, discussed and compared with literature results on the same UAV to quantify the increase of payload and cruise time that can be obtained by exploiting the synergy between structure and powertrain.

Prior to session key exchange with the corresponding server, a mobile user needs to be authenticated by that server in order to avail its services. Assorted authentication protocols are introduced so far, for authenticating the legitimate mobile users. Very recently, Lu et al introduced a two-factor scheme for key exchange in the mobile client-server environment. Lu et al declared that their introduced scheme is anonymous and robust for preventing potential attacks. However, we determined that the scheme of Lu et al is susceptible against server key reveal and smart card stolen attack. Moreover, it is also identified that their scheme is prone to traceability and anonymity violation attacks. Therefore, we proposed an improvement in order to increase the security and effectiveness. The immunity of the proposed protocol and correctness is tested, analyzed, and verified through formal proof of automated tool ProVerif and Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic, respectively. Moreover, the security and performance comparison also proved that the improved scheme is robust, efficient, and lightweight. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In the system, since the position and the data amount of sensors are stochastic, the UAV as a relay scans the area along a fixed path to collect the data of all sensors. Energy saving is the main challenge to prolong the life time of the sensors. The main research of this paper is to reduce the energy consumption of all sensors by jointly optimizing the flight trajectory of UAV, the time schedule and the power of the sensor to transmit data. The original problem can be formulated as a non-convex and mixed-integer optimization problem. According to the number of sensors in the communication area of the UAV, we studied the problem by dividing it into a single sensor and multiple sensors case. Moreover, the successive convex optimization techniques and differential evolution algorithm are applied to solve the problem.

Complex coacervate core micelles (C3Ms) comprising oppositely charged macromolecules constitute a novel class of polymeric micelles ideally suited for use as responsive nanoscopic delivery vehicles of hydrophilic and hydrophobic cargo. To fully exploit their potential, it is important that the C3Ms form and fall apart in an autonomous fashion as orchestrated by dynamic cues in their environment. Herein a means to temporally program the self-regulated C3M coassembly pathway, using a modulated base-catalyzed feedback system, is presented. Incorporated in the C3Ms is a pH responsive polyfluorene-based conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPF) as a building block and trace amounts of a molecular sensor (doxorubicin HCl) as cargo, both of which report on micellar coassembly and disassembly via binding-induced fluorescence quenching. CPF additionally reports on the pH of its microenvironment as its pH-dependent conformational states are mirrored in the transitions of its vibronic bands. This experimental design enables one to monitor solution pH, C3M disassembly and reassembly, as well as cargo release and recapture noninvasively in a closed system with real time florescence experiments. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In addition to the use of attitude sensors, exploiting the horizon as a visual reference for attitude control is part of human pilots’ training. For this reason, and given the desirable properties of image sensors, quite a lot of research has been conducted proposing the use of vision sensors for horizon detection in order to obtain redundant attitude estimation onboard unmanned aerial vehicles. However, atmospheric and illumination conditions may hinder the operability of visible light image sensors, or even make their use impractical, such as during the night. Thermal infrared image sensors have a much wider range of operation conditions and their price has greatly decreased during the last years, becoming an alternative to visible spectrum sensors in certain operation scenarios. In this paper, two attitude estimation methods are proposed. The first method consists of a novel approach to estimate the line that best fits the horizon in a thermal image. The resulting line is then used to estimate the pitch and roll angles using an infinite horizon line model. The second method uses deep learning to predict attitude angles using raw pixel intensities from a thermal image. For this, a novel Convolutional Neural Network architecture has been trained using measurements from an inertial navigation system. Both methods presented are proven to be valid for redundant attitude estimation, providing RMS errors below 1.7° and running at up to 48 Hz, depending on the chosen method, the input image resolution and the available computational capabilities. © The Author(s) 2018.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This has enabled a new age of smart CPS and IoT with emerging applications like autonomous vehicles, smart cities and houses, advanced robotics, IoT-Healthcare, and Industry 4.0. Due to the availability of a huge amount of data and compute power, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become one of the enabling technologies behind this current age of machine learning and intelligent systems. The benefits of DNNs however come at a high computational cost and require tremendous amount of energy/power resources that are typically not available on (embedded) IoT and CPS devices, especially when considering the IoT-Edge nodes.

Consumer-grade drones have high definition imagery and offer a non-invasive way to monitor a subset of marine megafauna, especially those species that spend part of their life near the water’s surface. However, a key question is the extent to which drone imagery data offer reliable abundance estimates due to potential detection restraints, and the ability to compare data from different locations. Here we tested the efficacy of a quadcopter drone to collect megafauna abundance data in multiple shallow-water habitats in the realistic background variation of shoreline development. On Great Abaco Island, The Bahamas we repeated drone surveys in nearshore habitats from June to August 2015 at three paired high and low human population sites. We tested the drone's detection probability using decoy organisms and found no effect of water quality or benthic characteristics on detectability. In short, the drones appear to work to monitor these species. We also noted patterns in the occupancy of the species on which we focused. We observed three shark, two ray, and two sea turtle species, finding higher abundances of all species in our low human population sites compared to high human population sites. Our results highlight the ability of consumer-grade drones to estimate the abundance and distribution of large-bodied elasmobranchs and sea turtles in shallow water habitats. Further, our study supports their capability to evaluate issues related to the conservation and management of nearshore ecosystems. © 2018, Escuela de Ciencias del Mar.

Hence, Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal is popularly adopted in such devices as a competent alternative of existing standard bio-signals. But research in the area of computerized analysis of PPG signal to extract relevant clinical information is still insufficient. In this paper, a robust, automated yet simple feature extraction algorithm is proposed for the PPG signal through accurate detection of characteristic points. The methodology consists of signal derivative, amplitude thresholding slope-reversal and empirical formula based approach. Baseline modulation is removed from the PPG dataset and then features are extracted from the amplitude normalized PPG signal.

Accurate traffic flow prediction provides a foundation for other tasks, such as signal coordination and travel time forecasting. There are many known methods in literature for the short-term traffic flow prediction problem, but their efficacy depends heavily on the traffic characteristics. It is difficult, if not impossible, to pick a single method that works well over time. In this paper, we present an automated framework to address this practical issue. Instead of selecting a single method, we combine predictions from multiple methods to generate a consensus traffic flow prediction. We propose an ensemble learning model that exploits the temporal characteristics of the data, and balances the accuracy of individual models and their mutual dependence through a covariance-regularizer. We additionally use a pruning scheme to remove anomalous individual predictions. We apply our proposed model to multi-step-ahead arterial roadway flow prediction. In tests, our method consistently outperforms recently published ensemble prediction methods based on ridge regression and lasso. Our method also produces steady results even when the standalone models and other ensemble methods make wildly exaggerated predictions. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This research proposes an automatic novel technique for the depth estimation of single 2D images via transfer learning of pre-trained deep learning model. This is a challenging problem, as a single 2D image does not carry any cues regarding depth. To tackle this, the pool of available images is exploited for which the depth is known. By following the hypothesis that the color images having similar semantics are most probably to have similar depth. Along these lines, the depth of the input image is predicted through corresponding depth maps of semantically similar images available in the dataset, fetched by high-level features of pre-trained deep learning model followed by a classifier (i.e., K-Nearest Neighbor). Afterward, a Cross Bilateral filter is applied for the removal of fallacious depth variations in the depth map.

This system is enabling the exploration and development of innovative system solutions to meet future Air Force real-time HPC needs; e.g., multi-mission and multifunction ISR processing and exploitation. The Agile Condor system innovations include: (1) a cost-effective and flexible compute architecture, (2) support for multiple missions, (3) facilitating realistic, repeatable experimentation, and (4) enabling related experimentation and applications for operational exploitation of a wide range of information products. On the recent collection, demonstration and data collection efforts, information was simultaneously processed in a parallelized approach using two distinct ML approaches.

It needs to be understood; its origin and trajectory duly analyzed and tracked; so as to confine it in a limited spatial domain of least contamination. In this study, we propose a Modified Firefly Algorithm (PropFA) which is closely based on Firefly Algorithm (Yang, 2008). Unlike Firefly Algorithm, no parameter tuning is required in PropFA as all parameters are dynamically calculated based on present, past and expected objective function values; thus maintaining a proper balance between “exploration” and “exploitation”. The proposed algorithm is evaluated over 18 Classical Benchmark Functions, 14 Benchmark Functions of CEC-2005 (Real-Parameter Optimization) and 28 Benchmark Functions of CEC-2013 (Special Session on Real-Parameter Optimization). PropFA is compared to modern evolutionary and metaheuristic algorithms like PSO, CMA-ES, RC-MEMETIC, EDA etc. The numerical results show that the PropFA enhances the performance of Firefly Algorithm; successfully avoids local minima across dimensions and has a fast convergence. PropFA is then used to model a system for distributed control of swarm UAVs (UnManned Aerial Vehicles) to efficiently search, confine and track the shape and area of irregular dynamic oil spills for fast containment and trajectory estimation. The proposed method is also used to predict boom placement locations around the spill for its efficient confinement.

Spectrum usage and management becomes a more and more serious issue in SIN mainly for the following reasons: (i) the paradox between spectrum shortage and spectrum under-utilization, (ii) the complex electromagnetic spectrum environment with tremendous spectrum devices and ubiquitous spectrum interference, and (iii) the spectrum disorder and spectrum attack. In this paper, we propose to empower SIN with big spectrum data analytics for dynamic spectrum sharing, real-time spectrum monitoring, and intelligent spectrum control. Specifically, we first identify critical spectrum issues in developing SIN and highlight that spectrum data analytics is the key solution to address these issues via spectrum sensing, spectrum data statistical inference and knowledge discovery, spectrum data-driven decision optimization, and spectrum experiment validation and evaluation, etc. Then, we introduce the concept of big spectrum data in SIN and analyze its characteristics, including volume, value, variety, viability, veracity, and velocity.

In these environments, cooperative strategies can be effectively exploited when flying in GNSS-challenging conditions, e.g., natural/urban canyons, while the different UAVs can fly as independent systems in the absence of navigation issues (i.e., open sky conditions). These different flight environments are taken into account at path planning level, obtaining a distributed multi-UAV system that autonomously reconfigures itself based on mission needs. Path planning, formulated as a vehicle routing problem, aims at defining smooth and flyable polynomial trajectories, whose time of flight is estimated to guarantee coexistence of different UAVs at the same challenging area. The algorithm is tested in a simulation environment directly derived from a real-world 3D scenario, for variable number of UAVs and waypoints. Its solution and computational cost are compared with optimal planning methods. Results show that the computational burden is almost unaffected by the number of UAVs, and it is compatible with near real time implementation even for a relatively large number of waypoints. The provided solution takes full advantage from the available flight resources, reducing mission time for a given set of waypoints and for increasing UAV number. © 2018 by the authors.

This breath has reached the realm of safety-critical applications such as time management of critical infrastructures or autonomous vehicles, in which GNSS is an essential tool nowadays. Unfortunately, current GNSS performance is not enough to fulfill the requirements of these professional and critical applications. For this reason, the FANTASTIC project was launched to boost the adoption of these applications. The project was funded by the European GNSS agency (GSA) in order to enhance the robustness and accuracy of GNSS in harsh environments. This paper presents the part related to the development of a weighting and exclusion function with a dual circularly polarized antenna. The idea is to reduce the effects of multipath by weighting and/or excluding those measurements affected by multipath. The observables and other metrics obtained from a dual polarized antenna will be exploited to define an exclusion threshold and to provide the weights. Real-world experiments will show the improvement in the positioning solution, using all available constellations, obtained with the developed technique. © 2018 by the authors.

However, it has been revealed that DNNs have weaknesses in the face of adversarial examples, which are created by adding a little noise to an original sample to cause misclassification by the DNN. Such adversarial examples can lead to fatal accidents in applications such as autonomous vehicles and disease diagnostics. Thus, the generation of adversarial examples has attracted extensive research attention recently. An adversarial example is categorized as targeted or untargeted. In this paper, we focus on the untargeted adversarial example scenario because it has a faster learning time and less distortion compared with the targeted adversarial example. However, there is a pattern vulnerability with untargeted adversarial examples: Because of the similarity between the original class and certain specific classes, it may be possible for the defending system to determine the original class by analyzing the output classes of the untargeted adversarial examples. To overcome this problem, we propose a new method for generating untargeted adversarial examples, one that uses an arbitrary class in the generation process. Moreover, we show that our proposed scheme can be applied to steganography. Through experiments, we show that our proposed scheme can achieve a 100% attack success rate with minimum distortion (1.99 and 42.32 using the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, respectively) and without the pattern vulnerability. Using a steganography test, we show that our proposed scheme can be used to fool humans, as demonstrated by the probability of their detecting hidden classes being equal to that of random selection. © 2018 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Adaptation of the agricultural sector is vital to increase the resilience of smallholder farmers’ livelihoods in times of climate change. To complement efforts already implemented by farmers to reduce social vulnerability it is important to understand how farmers perceive their current and future capacity to adapt to climate change. This paper aims to explore smallholder farmers’ capacity to respond to climate change in current and future agricultural production. We carried out open, in-depth interviews (n = 13), focus group discussions, and structured interviews (n = 114) in the Thua Thien Hue province. Our findings show that farmers nowadays experience more extreme climate variability. Farmers report increasing stresses due to temperature increase and droughts. The autonomous adaptation strategies adopted by farmers include; adjusting the season calendar, using tolerant varieties and breeds, applying integrated crop production models, and income diversification. The motives for adopting particular planned adaptation options differ between farmers in crop production and livestock production. Four factors were found to be significant (p <.05) in influencing the spread of adaptation measures (AMs) farmers adopted: farm income, the number of available information sources, number of workers on the farm, and farmable land available during the summer season. Farmers report several barriers to implement adaptation strategies including; market price fluctuations, lack of skilled labour, lack of climate change information, and lack of capacity to learn and apply techniques in their daily practice. While both crop and livestock farmers participated in one or several training courses on climate change in the past years, livestock farmers were still uncertain about their future capacity and possible AMs. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

The proposed algorithm significantly reduces pathfinding computing time without significantly degrading path lengths by using space circumscription and a sparse visibility graph in the pathfinding process. We devise a novel method by exploiting the information about obstacle geometry to circumscribe the search space in the form of a half cylinder from which a working path for UAV can be computed without sacrificing the guarantees on near-optimality and speed. Furthermore, we generate a sparse visibility graph from the circumscribed space and find the initial path, which is subsequently optimized. The proposed algorithm effectively resolves the efficiency and optimality trade-off by searching the path only from the high priority circumscribed space of a map. The simulation results obtained from various maps, and comparison with the existing methods show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and verify the aforementioned claims. © 2018 by the authors.

Although prior works have shown the performance improvement by exploiting the UAV's mobility, they mainly focus on delay-tolerant applications. As delay requirements fundamentally limit the UAV's mobility, it remains unknown whether the UAV is able to provide any performance gain in delay-constrained communication scenarios. Motivated by the above, we study, in this paper, an UAV-enabled orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) network where an UAV is dispatched as the mobile base station (BS) to serve a group of users on the ground. We consider a minimum-rate ratio (MRR) for each user, defined as the minimum instantaneous rate required over the average achievable throughput, to flexibly adjust the percentage of its delay-constrained data traffic. Under a given set of constraints on the users' MRRs, we aim to maximize the minimum average throughput of all users by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and OFDMA resource allocation. First, we show that the max-min throughput in general decreases as the users' MRRs become larger, which reveals a fundamental throughput-delay tradeoff in UAV-enabled communications. Next, we propose an iterative parameter-assisted block coordinate descent method to optimize the UAV trajectory and OFDMA resource allocation alternately, by applying the successive convex optimization and the Lagrange duality, respectively. Furthermore, an efficient and systematic UAV trajectory initialization scheme is proposed based on the simple circular trajectory. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, the connectivity function makes CAVs vulnerable to cyber-attacks. An intuitive method to defend cyber-attacks on CAVs is that if the error between expected and measured behaviors exceeds a predetermined threshold, a security scheme should be activated. This study investigates another type of cyber-attack, denoted as slight attacks, in which the communicated data of CAVs are randomly deviated from the actual ones and deviations do not exceed the threshold. The primary objective is to evaluate the influence of slight cyber-attacks on longitudinal safety of CAVs. An empirical CAV model is first utilized to describe vehicle dynamics and generate trajectory data. A rear-end collision risk index (RCRI) derived from safe stopping distance is used to establish relation between longitudinal safety and trajectory data. Two attacked factors, communicated positions and speeds from preceding vehicles are tested. Extensive simulations are conducted and parameters are also tested via sensitivity analysis. Results indicate that (1) when one CAV is under slight cyber-attacks, it is more dangerous if communicated positions are attacked than speeds; (2) when multi CAVs are under attacked, it is possible that a situation with more vehicles under attack at a low severity may be more dangerous than that with fewer vehicles but under attack at a high severity; (3) the impact of slight cyber-attacks on deceleration period is more serious compared to acceleration period.

In this paper, we investigate the deployment and trajectory planning problem in three-dimensional (3D) space with jamming, where a UAV communicates with the ground node while some jammers attack the transmission. The formulated optimization is non-convex and hard to be solved directly. By introducing the slack variables and leveraging the successive convex approximation, we design a trajectory planning method to optimize the UAV's horizontal position and vertical altitude in 3D space. Furthermore, we study the static deployment scenario, which also provides an upper bound for the trajectory planning case with unlimited speed. For single jammer case, we derive an analytical expression for the optimal UAV's location to efficiently resist attacks. For multiple jammers case, we provide a sub-optimal deployment scheme.

Wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication is exploited to monitor the motion of multiple broadcasting vehicles, and a strategy is designed to determine whether the received data of other vehicles are incorporated into CACC. A condition is derived for choosing control gains that ensure the internal stability of CAVs in the presence of time delays and switching connectivity topologies of information flow. Moreover, because the switching connectivity topologies May change the dynamics of the whole vehicle chain, the authors apply a data-driven approach for online optimisation of control gains such that CACC adapts to the variations of connectivity topologies. The proposed selective CACC is validated through numerical simulations. To enhance the fidelity of simulations, they use the data collected through on-road experiments to simulate the motion of human-driven vehicles and apply the physics-based vehicle dynamic model to simulate the motion of CAVs.

Out of all obstacle detection sensors, ultrasonic sensors have the largest market share and are expected to be increasingly installed on automobiles. Such sensors discover obstacles by emitting ultrasounds and analyzing their reflections. By exploiting the built-in vulnerabilities of sensors, we designed random spoofing, adaptive spoofing, and jamming attacks on ultrasonic sensors, and we managed to trick a vehicle to stop when it should keep moving, and let it fail to stop when it should. We validate our attacks on stand-alone sensors and moving vehicles, including a Tesla Model S with the 'Autopilot' system. The results show that the attacks cause blindness and malfunction of not only sensors but also autonomous vehicles, which can lead to collisions. To enhance the security of ultrasonic sensors and autonomous vehicles, we propose two defense strategies, single-sensor-based physical shift authentication that verifies signals on the physical level, and multiple sensor consistency check that employs multiple sensors to verify signals on the system level. Our experiments on real sensors and MATLAB simulation reveal the validity of both schemes. © 2014 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The narrow Bragg Peak at the end of range is a major advantage but range uncertainties can cause severe damage and require online verification to maximise the effectiveness in clinics. In-beam Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a non-invasive, promising in-vivo technique, which consists in the measurement of the β+ activity induced by beam-tissue interactions during treatment, and presents the highest correlation of the measured activity distribution with the deposited dose, since it is not much influenced by biological washout. Here we report the first clinical results obtained with a state-of-the-art in-beam PET scanner, with on-the-fly reconstruction of the activity distribution during irradiation. An automated time-resolved quantitative analysis was tested on a lacrimal gland carcinoma case, monitored during two consecutive treatment sessions. The 3D activity map was reconstructed every 10 s, with an average delay between beam delivery and image availability of about 6 s. The correlation coefficient of 3D activity maps for the two sessions (above 0.9 after 120 s) and the range agreement (within 1 mm) prove the suitability of in-beam PET for online range verification during treatment, a crucial step towards adaptive strategies in particle therapy. © 2018 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

PT across IIoT networks requires system administrators to attempt multiple and often bespoke commercial tools for testing vulnerable network nodes, platforms, and software. In this paper, we propose a new testbed IIoT environment involving multiple vulnerable platforms connected to IIoT sensors and IoT gateways for designing automated vulnerability and exploitation identification techniques based on analyzing network flows. We utilize a particle filter technique for estimating the vulnerability and exploitation behaviors in a term of posterior probabilities. The proposed model is better than using traditional artificial planning algorithms that consume significant computational resources and demand termination criteria. The proposed testbed IIoT environment can be shared with other like-minded researchers to facilitate future evaluations. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The design goal is to perform the automatic lane keeping under multiple system constraints, namely actuator saturation of the steering system, roads with unknown curvature and uncertain lateral wind force. Such system constraints are explicitly taken into account in the control design procedure. To achieve this goal, we propose a new constrained Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model-based control method using fuzzy Lyapunov control framework. The resulting non-parallel distributed compensation controller is able to handle not only various system constraints but also a large variation range of vehicle speed. In particular, Taylor's approximation method is exploited to reduce not only the numerical complexity for real-time implementation but also the conservatism of the results. The design conditions are strictly expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities which can be efficiently solved with available numerical solvers. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated through both simulation and hardware experiments with various driving scenarios. © 2017 The Franklin Institute","Article","Final","Scopus"

The UAV hovers above each sensor for one time slot for information collection. It is assumed that the transmission range of the UAV is limited, and thus, the energy broadcasted from the UAV is only available for the next adjacent sensor to harvest in the case where the sensors are sparsely distributed in the IoT networks. Since the full-duplex mode is adopted and no initial energy harvest time is allocated to the entire IoT networks, the coupling time relationship makes the solution of the model more challenging. Under the proposed model, we formulate two problems: sum-throughput maximization (STM) and total-hover-time minimization (THTM). For the STM problem, the optimal solution is obtained by applying convex optimization techniques. For the THTM problem, by exploiting the properties of the coupled constraints, we propose an algorithm to obtain an optimal solution. Finally, the numerical results show that the performance achieved by the proposed optimal time allocation scheme outperforms an equal time allocation scheme, under block-fading and line of sight (LoS) channels. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Based on the similarity between cooperative combat mission of UAVs and the behavior of biological swarm, a collaborative confrontation method of UAVs cluster based on the intelligent behavior of hawks is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the intelligent behavior mechanism of the hawks is established and mapped to the cooperative confrontation model of the UAVs cluster by analyzing the hunting behavior of the Harris hawks. On the basis of the model, the Lyapunov navigation vector field is employed in the control of UAV motion, which makes the position of our drones converge to the predetermined trajectory at a constant speed; Finally, the platform of UAV swarm is established for the validation of the model designed based on the imitation of the hawks.

The study area represents the largest gold area in Roman times and comprises 7 mining elements of interest that characterize the most representative examples of such ancient works. UAV technology provides a non-invasive procedure valuable for the acquisition of digital information in remote, difficult to access areas or under the risk of destruction. The proposed approach is a cost-effective, robust and rapid method for image processing in remote areas were no traditional surveying technologies are available. It is based on a combination of data provided by aerial orthoimage and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) to improve the accuracy of UAV derived data. The results provide high-resolution orthomosaic, DEMs and 3D textured models that aim for the documentation of ancient mining scenarios, providing high-resolution digital information that improves the identification, description and interpretation of mining elements such as the hydraulic infrastructure, the presence of open-cast mines which exemplifies the different exploitation methods, and settlements. However, beyond the scientific and technical information provided by the data, the 3D documentation of ancient mining scenarios is a powerful tool for an effective and wider public diffusion ensuring the visualization, preservation and awareness over the importance and conservation of world mining heritage sites. © 2018 by the authors.

This approach consists of two phases, the spoofing detection phase which is accomplished by hypothesis test and the trajectory estimation phase which is carried out by applying the adapted particle filters to the integrated inertial navigation system (INS) and GPS. Due to nonlinearity and unfavorable impacts of spoofing signals on GPS receivers, deviation in position calculation is modeled as a cumulative uniform error. This paper also presents a procedure of applying adapted particle swarm optimization filter (PSOF) to the INS/GPS integration system as an estimator to compensate spoofing attacks. Due to memory based nature of PSOF and benefits of each particle’s experiences, application of PSOF algorithm in the INS/GPS integration system leads to more precise positioning compared with general particle filter (PF) and adaptive unscented particle filer (AUPF) in the GPS spoofing attack scenarios. Simulation results show that the adapted PSOF algorithm is more reliable and accurate in estimating the true position of UAV in the condition of spoofing attacks.

A crucial problem of the CAHEVs is that the lithium-ion batteries are highly temperature sensitive, whose output power is severely limited at low temperatures. Moreover, the cells may be premature aging at high operating temperatures and even result in an explosion, seriously threatening the human safety. Consequently, a practical and energy-efficient battery thermal management (BTM) strategy is required with the minimum possible cooling/heating energy consumption. To achieve the multiple objectives, a finite-set based model predictive control (FSMPC) strategy is presented for the BTM in CAHEVs. Since the thermoelectric model of the BTM system is highly nonlinear and time variant, an extended state observer is implemented for accurate system state estimation and prediction so that the parameter uncertainties inherent in the system can be compensated. The hardware-in-the-loop validation of the proposed strategy is conducted on the urban dynamometer drive schedule-based on a Toyota Prius plug-in HEV model. The results demonstrate that the proposed BTM strategy can maintain the battery pack in the CAHEV operating at the optimum temperature and save 30% BTM energy compared to the conventional method even under 50% parameter uncertainty. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Waterbirds often breed in largely inaccessible colonies in flooded habitats, so unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys provide a robust method for estimating their breeding population size. Counts of breeding pairs might be carried out by manual and automated detection routines. In this study we surveyed the main breeding colony of Glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus) at the Doñana National Park. We obtained a high resolution image, in which the number and location of nests were determined manually through visual interpretation by an expert. We also suggest a standardized methodology for nest counts that would be repeatable across time for long-term monitoring censuses, through a supervised classification based primarily on the spectral properties of the image and a subsequent automatic size and form based count. Although manual and automatic count were largely similar in the total number of nests, accuracy between both methodologies was only 46.37%, with higher variability in shallow areas free of emergent vegetation than in areas dominated by tall macrophytes.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among residents (N = 89) and staff members (N = 86) of the nursing home. Outbreak description was performed in both residents and staff members. Among residents, attack rates and relative risks and their 95% confidence interval (95% CI) associated with different identified risk factors including consumption of normal, mixed and choped meal, score of dependency were calculated. A multivariate logistic regression model was fitted to assess the independent association between risk factors and the occurrence of acute gastroenteritis over the entire outbreak duration. Environmental investigations and review of practices were carried out among staff. Results: Respectively 49/89 respondent residents (AR 58%) and 9/47 respondent staff members (AR 19%) reported gastrointestinal symptoms between September 17 and October 21, 2016. Norovirus type II was isolated in five stool samples. Residents with dependency score (Gir) below 4 were at higher risk of acute gastroenteritis [RR 2.1 (95% CI 1.1–4.1)] compared to those autonomous. It was the only identified risk factor. In addition, the review of practices in staff identified several breaks in the application of hygiene control standards including misuse of personal protective equipment (gloves were not changed between caring for different patients), inappropriate hand hygiene technique, and disinfection of environmental surfaces with an ineffective product on norovirus. Conclusions: This episode reminds the importance of early recognition of acute gastroenteritis cases and the implementation of rigorous management measures in order to limit the spread of the epidemic in a highly vulnerable dependent population. © 2018, European Geriatric Medicine Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

They are either remotely controlled or programmed and fully autonomous. Typically, these are used for entertainment or as a means for filming events or activities. The development of all these LSS UAV goes with an increased risk of seeing them used for military or terrorist actions. Indeed, because of their versatility and current technical capacities, using LSS UAVs to carry small caliber weapons or to deliver an improvised explosive device (IED) to a potential target in an urban environment becomes feasible with relatively low expertise and means. Already, many recent news report the presence of LSS UAV in situations where they could represent serious threats. Due to a technological gap on detection technologies, these potentially harmful LSS UAVS are currently likely to be visually spotted very late by the security teams, typically a few dozen meters from their potential target. Such a conclusion makes the use of capture solutions such as drone-chasing drones, or even using birds of prey, inadequate. Besides, in the context of urban environment, fancy technologies such as jammers, lasers, or other high-energy devices are potentially unsuitable due to possible strict regulations concerning the use of wave emitting devices and a high potential of collateral damage on other equipment. The following study discusses the potential suitability of kinetic energy non-lethal weapons (KENLW) to neutralize LSS UAV in such conditions as the last line of defense. These weapons are designed to minimize permanent or unnecessary injuries when used against human targets. The study is divided into five parts. Firstly, LSS UAV and KENLW are defined and the market is analyzed in order to focus the work on representative candidates of these two categories. Secondly, impacts of KENLW projectiles on LSS UAV are performed in a controlled environment in order to highlight the effect of the impact on the target. The results are presented in terms of V50, which is defined as the velocity characterized by a probability to produce the desired effect of 50%. The projectiles show good potential to break the propellers or even the hull of the LSS UAVs. Thirdly, a theoretic study which objective is to discuss the probability to hit the target is proposed. The results show reasonable probabilities to hit the propellers or the hull with a perfect aiming. Besides, the aiming problem is discussed and highlight the need of dedicated aiming systems to reach the presented results. Fourthly, the potential collateral damage occurring when such projectiles impact human targets is studied. The selected projectiles give mixed results. The most efficient projectiles on the LSS UAV are also the most harmful when impacting the human body. Finally, conclusions concerning the suitability of KENLW systems for neutralizing LSS UAV threats are drawn. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Nevertheless, the directionality of mmWave communications and its susceptibility to blockage raise severe questions on the feasibility of mmWave vehicular communications. The dynamic nature of 5G vehicular scenarios and the complexity of directional mmWave communication calls for higher context-awareness and adaptability. To this aim, we propose an online learning algorithm addressing the problem of beam selection with environment-awareness in mmWave vehicular systems. In particular, we model this problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem. Next, we propose a lightweight context-aware online learning algorithm, namely fast machine learning (FML), with proven performance bound and guaranteed convergence. FML exploits coarse user location information and aggregates the received data to learn from and adapt to its environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of a real-world implementation of FML by proposing a standard-compliant protocol based on the existing architecture of cellular networks and the forthcoming features of 5G. We also perform an extensive evaluation using realistic traffic patterns derived from Google Maps. Our evaluation shows that FML enables mmWave base stations to achieve near-optimal performance on average within 33 mins of deployment by learning from the available context. Moreover, FML remains within 5% of the optimal performance by swift adaptation to system changes (i.e., blockage, traffic). © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Even with simulation, many factors including vehicle dynamics, sensor errors, automated vehicle control algorithms and crash severity need to be properly modeled. In this paper, a simulation platform is proposed which explicitly features: (i) vehicle dynamics; (ii) sensor errors and communication delays; (iii) compatibility with CACC controllers; (iv) state-of-the-art predecessor leader following (PLF) based cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) controller; and (v) ability to quantify crash severity and CACC stability. The proposed simulation platform evaluated the CACC performance under normal and cybersecurity attack scenarios using speed variation, headway ratio, and injury probability. The first two measures of effectiveness (MOEs) represent the stability of CACC platoon while the injury probability quantifies the severity of a crash. The proposed platform can evaluate the safety performance of CACC controllers of interest under various paroxysmal or extreme events. It is particularly useful when traditional empirical driver models are not applicable. Such situations include, but are not limited to, cyber-attacks, sensor failures, and heterogeneous traffic conditions.

Our proposed localization technique uses two or more proximity sensors with one or more angular orientation sensors while exploiting the cylindrical geometry of tanks. For the planar case, we study the map of the sensor error to the robot position error using a Monte Carlo error optimization analysis. We study the case of two, three and four proximity sensors while varying the relative orientation placement of these sensors. We conclude that the use of one orientation sensor, and four proximity sensors spaced 45 degrees apart give the least error in computing the robot position inside the tank from sensor measurements. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The trajectory has to avoid obstacles and no-fly zones and must take into account the kinematic constraints of the air vehicle. Design/methodology/approach: A discrete routing model is proposed that represents the airspace by a sophisticated network. The problem is then solved by applying standard shortest-path algorithms. Findings: In contrast to the most widely used grids, the generated networks allow arbitrary flight directions and turn angles, as well as maneuvers of different strengths, thus fully exploiting the flight capabilities of the aircraft. Moreover, the networks are resolution-independent and provide high flexibility by the option to adapt density. Practical implications: As an application, a concept for in-flight replanning of flight paths to changing destinations is proposed. All computationally intensive tasks are performed in a pre-flight planning prior to the launch of the mission. The in-flight planning is based entirely on precalculated data, which are stored in the onboard computer of the air vehicle. In particular, no path finding algorithms with high or unpredictable running time and uncertain outcome have to be applied during flight. Originality/value: The paper presents a new network-based algorithm for flight path optimization that overcomes weaknesses of grid-based approaches and allows high-quality solutions. The method can be applied for quick in-flight replanning of flight paths. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, the crowded microwave band can hardly meet the needs of high throughput in next generation (5G) networks, and the broadcasting nature of radiation makes UAVs prone to passive eavesdropping attacks. In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security (PLS) problem in UAV-Enabled millimeter wave downlink transmission, where one UAV communicates with a ground sensor while another UAV may intercept the communications between them. In contrast to the previous works, the UAVs' trajectory is extended to the three-dimensional (3D) space other than in a fixed altitude. The 3D sectorized antenna model is used to compare performance of directivity and gain, with which the concept of mobile secrecy guard cone (MSGC) is introduced to make the potential eavesdropper UAV remain outside the directional antenna beam during the flight. By applying block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization methods, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convexity of the formulated problem.

The proposal includes a heuristic modeling method adopted to assign tasks from definite orders which will be sent to the controller, and a collaborative routing algorithm exploiting the AGVs mobility on specific trajectories. Experiments have shown that, using mobility features of the AGVs, the integrated solution can promptly repair the network when a node and the relative link fail or the detected quality is low, significantly reducing the energy consumption of wireless nodes and data communication delay, thus improving the overall throughput and reliability of industrial IoT systems. © 2018","Article","Final","Scopus"

To this end, the presented algorithm employs a detailed digital map to predict future paths of observed vehicles and then uses the predicted future paths to identify potential threats - observed vehicles that have the potential to pose a threat to the autonomous vehicle. Next, it establishes vehicle-to-vehicle collision relations with the potential threats. It then employs Bayesian networks and time window filtering to assess the potential threats reliably and robustly regarding the possibility of collision, even under uncertain and incomplete noise data. We have tested and evaluated the presented algorithm through in-vehicle testing at unsignalized T-junctions regarding two representative maneuvers: merging into traffic on the major road and being merged by traffic on the minor road. In-vehicle testing results show that the performance of the presented algorithm is sufficiently reliable to be used in decision-making for autonomous driving at unsignalized T-junctions, in terms of reliability and robustness. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This is perhaps most evident in Diagnostic Radiology and Pathology, specialties largely built around the processing and complex interpretation of medical images, where the role of AI is increasingly seen as both a boon and a threat. In Radiation Oncology as well, AI seems poised to reshape the specialty in significant ways, though the impact of AI has been relatively limited at present, and may rightly seem more distant to many, given the predominantly interpersonal and complex interventional nature of the specialty.

Existing offline formal methods for (untrusted) controller code verification usually face state-explosion. On the other hand, runtime monitors for cyber-physical UAVs often lead to too-late notifications about unsafe states that makes timely safe operation recovery impossible. We present Crystal, a just-ahead-of-time control flow predictor and proactive recovery for UAVs. Crystal monitors the execution state of the flight controller and predicts the future control flows ahead of time-based on the UAV's physical dynamics. Crystal deploys the operator's countermeasures proactively in case of an upcoming unsafe state. Crystal's just-ahead-of-time model checking explores the future control flows in parallel ahead of the UAV's actual operation by some time margin. The introduced time margin enables Crystal to accommodate operator's feedback latency by the time the actual execution reaches to the identified unsafe state. Crystal periodically queries the controller's execution state. It emulates the UAV physical dynamical model and predicts future sensor measurements (controller inputs) and upcoming feasible controller's execution paths. This drives Crystal's model-checking exploration away from unreachable future states. Crystal's selective model checking saves computational time to stay ahead of execution by concentrating on relevant upcoming control flows only. This eliminates the state-explosion problem in traditional offline formal methods. We evaluated a multi-threaded prototype of Crystal between the control station server and the UAV. Crystal was able to predict upcoming hazardous states caused by the third-party controller program and proactively restored the safe states successfully with minimal overhead. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this study, we use a multi-scale modeling approach to interrogate the implications of three metabolic scenarios of potential clinical relevance: the Warburg effect, the reverse Warburg effect and glutamine addiction. At the intracellular level, we construct a network of central metabolism and perform flux balance analysis (FBA) to estimate metabolic fluxes; at the cellular level, we exploit this metabolic network to calculate parameters for a coarse-grained description of cellular growth kinetics; and at the multicellular level, we incorporate these kinetic schemes into the cellular automata of an agent-based model (ABM), iDynoMiCS. This ABM evaluates the reaction-diffusion of the metabolites, cellular division and motion over a simulation domain. Our multi-scale simulations suggest that the Warburg effect provides a growth advantage to the tumor cells under resource limitation. However, we identify a non-monotonic dependence of growth rate on the strength of glycolytic pathway. On the other hand, the reverse Warburg scenario provides an initial growth advantage in tumors that originate deeper in the tissue. The metabolic profile of stromal cells considered in this scenario allows more oxygen to reach the tumor cells in the deeper tissue and thus promotes tumor growth at earlier stages. Lastly, we suggest that glutamine addiction does not confer a selective advantage to tumor growth with glutamine acting as a carbon source in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, any advantage of glutamine uptake must come through other pathways not included in our model (e.g., as a nitrogen donor). Our analysis illustrates the importance of accounting explicitly for spatial and temporal evolution of tumor microenvironment in the interpretation of metabolic scenarios and hence provides a basis for further studies, including evaluation of specific therapeutic strategies that target metabolism. © 2018 Shan et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Increase in the coverage of lianas had adverse effects on forested ecosystems such as decreasing tree growth rates and increasing tree mortality. This paper proposes a classification framework that integrates unmanned aerial vehicle systems (UAVs)-derived multi-spectral images and a Deep self-encoding network (DSEN) with the goal of monitoring and quantifying the relative coverage of dead trees, liana-infested, and non-liana-infested trees at high spatial scales. Today's UAVs-derived multi-spectral images provide the much necessary high resolution/quality data to monitor ecosystem-level processes at low cost and on demand.

This new classification framework, implemented at a tropical Dry Forest site in Costa Rica, provided accurate estimations of the relative coverage of dead trees, liana-infested trees, non-liana-infested trees, and non-forests.

However, intensive use of these drugs has led to the selection of resistant parasites in livestock industry. In that respect, there is currently an urgent need for novel compounds able to control resistant parasites. Nicotine has also historically been used as a de-wormer but was removed from the market when modern anthelmintics became available. The pharmacological target of nicotine has been identified in nematodes as acetylcholine-gated ion channels. Nicotinic-sensitive acetylcholine receptors (N-AChRs) therefore represent validated pharmacological targets that remain largely under-exploited. In the present study, using an automated larval migration assay (ALMA), we report that nicotinic derivatives efficiently paralyzed a multiple (benzimidazoles/levamisole/pyrantel/ivermectin) resistant field isolate of H. contortus. Using C. elegans as a model we confirmed that N-AChRs are preferential targets for nornicotine and anabasine. Functional expression of the homomeric N-AChR from C. elegans and the distantly related horse parasite Parascaris equorum in Xenopus oocytes highlighted some striking differences in their respective pharmacological properties towards nicotine derivative sensitivity.

Raman spectroscopy also was applied to samples spanning a similar thermal range created from 72-h hydrous pyrolysis (HP) experiments of the Ohio Shale at temperatures from 300 to 360 °C and isothermal HP experiments lasting up to 100 days of similar Devonian-Mississippian New Albany Shale. Raman spectra were treated by automated evaluation software based on iterative and simultaneous modeling of signal and baseline functions to decrease subjectivity. Spectra show robust correlation to measured solid bitumen reflectance (BRo) values and were therefore used to construct logarithmic regression relationships for calculation of BRo equivalent values. Raman spectra show considerable differences between natural samples and HP residues with similar measured BRo values, indicating as-yet undetermined differences in carbon chemistry. We speculate this result may be due to differences in the sampling interactions of Raman vs reflectance measurements, and the incomplete nature of maturation reactions in the time-limited hydrous pyrolysis residues. Samples used in this study are similar in organic assemblage (dominantly solid bitumen) to other commonly exploited North American shale petroleum systems, i.e., Bakken, Barnett, Duvernay, Fayetteville, and Woodford shales. Therefore, results presented herein may be broadly applicable to other important shale plays. However, caution is suggested and Raman spectroscopy as a thermal probe may need individual calibration in each shale play due to differences in solid bitumen carbon chemistry. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The physical problem considered is the one of the simulation of the hydrodynamic flow past the hull of a ship advancing in calm water. Such problem is extremely relevant at the preliminary stages of the ship design, when several flow simulations are typically carried out by the engineers to assess the dependence of the hull total resistance on the geometrical parameters of the hull, and others related with flows and hull properties. Given the high number of geometric and physical parameters which might affect the total ship drag, the main idea of this work is to employ the active subspaces properties to identify possible lower dimensional structures in the parameter space. Thus, a fully automated procedure has been implemented to produce several small shape perturbations of an original hull CAD geometry, in order to exploit the resulting shapes and to run high fidelity flow simulations with different structural and physical parameters as well, and then collect data for the active subspaces analysis. The free form deformation procedure used to morph the hull shapes, the high fidelity solver based on potential flow theory with fully nonlinear free surface treatment, and the active subspaces analysis tool employed in this work have all been developed and integrated within SISSA mathLab as open source tools.

Morocco joins this context with the inauguration of numerous clean energy projects. However, one key factor in making photovoltaic installations a profitable investment are regular and effective inspections in order to detect occurred defects. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are increasingly used in various inspection fields. In this respect, this work focuses on the use of thermal and visual imagery taken by UAV in the inspection of photovoltaic installations. Visual and thermal images of photovoltaic modules, obtained by UAV, from different installations, and with different acquisition conditions and parameters, were exploited to generate orthomosaics for inspection purposes. The methodology was tested on a dataset we have acquired by a mission in Rabat (Morocco), and also on external datasets acquired in Switzerland. As final results, several visual defects were detected in visual RGB and thermal orthomosaics, such as cracks, soiling, and hotspots. In addition, a procedure of semi-automatic hotspots’ extraction was also developed and is presented within this work. On the other side, various tests were conducted on the influence of some acquisition and processing parameters (images’ overlap, the ground sampling distance, the flying height, the use of ground control points, the internal camera parameters’ optimization) on the detection of defects and the quality of visual and thermal generated orthomosaics. In the end, the potential of UAV thermal and visual imagery in the inspection of photovoltaic installations was discussed in function of various parameters. On the basis of the discussion feedback, UAV were concluded as advantageous tools within the thematic of this project, which proves the necessity of their implementation in this context. © 2018 by the authors.

Using pipeline supervised models to focus relevant structures, we achieve an accuracy of 94.4% for 15-view still-image echocardiographic view classification and 91.2% accuracy for binary left ventricular hypertrophy classification. We then develop semi-supervised generative adversarial network models that can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data in a generalizable fashion. We achieve greater than 80% accuracy in view classification with only 4% of labeled data used in solely supervised techniques and achieve 92.3% accuracy for left ventricular hypertrophy classification. In exploring trade-offs between model type, resolution, data resources, and performance, we present a comprehensive analysis and improvements of efficient deep learning solutions for medical imaging assessment especially in cardiology. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

To alleviate this limitation, this paper proposes a simple but promising hybrid predictive model by suitably combining the Chi-square distance measurement with case-based reasoning technique. The study presents the realization of an automated risk calculator and death prediction in some life-threatening ailments using Chi-square case-based reasoning (χ2 CBR) model. The proposed predictive engine is capable of reducing runtime and speeds up execution process through the use of critical χ2 distribution value. This work also showcases the development of a novel feature selection method referred to as frequent item based rule (FIBR) method. This FIBR method is used for selecting the best feature for the proposed χ2 CBR model at the preprocessing stage of the predictive procedures. The implementation of the proposed risk calculator is achieved through the use of an in-house developed PHP program experimented with XAMP/Apache HTTP server as hosting server. The process of data acquisition and case-based development is implemented using the MySQL application. Performance comparison between our system, the NBY, the ED-KNN, the ANN, the SVM, the Random Forest and the traditional CBR techniques shows that the quality of predictions produced by our system outperformed the baseline methods studied. The result of our experiment shows that the precision rate and predictive quality of our system in most cases are equal to or greater than 70%. Our result also shows that the proposed system executes faster than the baseline methods studied. Therefore, the proposed risk calculator is capable of providing useful, consistent, faster, accurate and efficient risk level prediction to both the patients and the physicians at any time, online and on a real-time basis. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

For effective growth of crops, lot of chemicals like fertilizers and pesticides are used, however, excessive usage of them results in damage to land and water resources. The attack of pests is a major criteria which affect crop yield. Various crop monitoring technologies are available which are highly expensive and not all farmers can afford. Moreover in India, farmers are not capable of understanding the operation and handling of such sophisticated technology. In this paper, we propose a system which is cheaper and easy to operate with multiple application. The proposed system uses a technology which utilizes machine learning and ANN algorithms using UAV that helps us to locate regions that are affected by diseases and pesticides so that we can particularly focus on the regions that are affected and apply chemicals only in that particular area, with the entire system being cost effective. For this purpose, we divide the entire area into n x n segments and using image processing, the segmented areas are analysed and processed using Ardupilot and a central operating system to monitor using python and open CV, giving the simplest user interface for monitoring purposes. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Mature glider autonomy, operating depth (0-1000 meters) and low energy consumption without a CO2 footprint enable evolutionary access across ocean basins. Pursuant to the first successful transatlantic glider crossing in December 2009, the Challenger Mission has opened the door to long-term, long-distance routine transoceanic AUV missions. These vehicles, which glide through the water column between 0 and 1000 meters depth, are highly sensitive to the ocean current field. Consequently, it is essential to exploit the complex space-time structure of the ocean current field in order to plan a path that optimizes scientific payoff and navigation efficiency. This letter demonstrates the capability of dynamical system theory for achieving this goal by realizing the real-time navigation strategy for the transoceanic AUV named Silbo, which is a Slocum deep-glider (0-1000 m), that crossed the North Atlantic from April 2016 to March 2017. Path planning in real time based on this approach has facilitated an impressive speed up of the AUV to unprecedented velocities resulting in major battery savings on the mission, offering the potential for routine transoceanic long duration missions. © 2018 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

The system security anchor is attained by first modifying the sensitive participating entities to make them physically clone-resistant. Novel joint-physical identification protocols are introduced to prohibit malicious fleet operations like illegal replacement of Vehicles, transported goods, drivers, predefined vehicle routes, starting point or destinations. The solution strategy is approached by networking all security-sensitive entities as Electronic Logging Device (ELD), Vehicle, drivers or goods and making them physically unique and securely identifiable. We propose for that purpose to embed the early concept of low-cost digital Secret Unknown Ciphers (SUCs) in such units to make them physically clone-resistant. The efficiency of that technique is demonstrated by introducing new protocols to create and manage joint-ELD-Vehicle clone-resistant identities. It is shown how to strictly prohibit many attacks in modern networked automated FMSs. System setup, sample generic protocols and solution scenarios are introduced to reach the targeted security levels.

With due regard to the orography of the territory, it is important to locate residual areas, where there is no possibility of their telemetric control. In the given issue, however, it is also necessary to take into account the legal framework representing a supplementary control function of maintaining flight safety of air traffic control in compliance with the ATM policies. The set-up of functional efficiency of controlling the flight of such an ATO in a complex area must be stable. In the article, stability is presented by error analysis at given lateral deviations after the ATO has switched into autonomous flight mode. Due to the errors caused by the external environment, the ATO must perform a precise flight into the area and achieve the success of the flight mission. For example, it may involve a flight into mountain territories, where it is important to secure the patient s status or the person under threat. The laboriousness of solution of such flights in a limited mountain terrain is divided into files of intelligent autonomous ports (Sky Control Object Power Environment - SCOPE). The task is to cover the residual areas for minimizing the time of rescuing persons present in the active corridors taking into account the probability of environmental change.

Pests are very dangerous to crops and reduce the harvest of affected crop and can cause risk if no technical methods are applied to strive against them. Fall armyworm (FAW) is one the pest that has attacked the priority stable crop of Rwanda (maize) since last year 2017. This reduced the expected harvest from this crop. The presence of this pest costs the government to use drones and other special forces to strive for it, but pest will remain a problem if there is no regular, automatic way to detect the pest and strive for it at the early days of attacking the crop. This paper introduces a design of a prototype of an automated system that will be able to detect the presence of a fall armyworm in the field. The system will use the new technology of Internet of Things (IoT) where sensors are used to identify the pest location. Once the presence of the pest is detected in the farm, the system will be able to give the information of the affected crop and notify the farmer through his/her mobile phone who will immediately react accordingly. Through the authorization from the farmer, the system will be able to pump pesticides to kill both larvae and eggs of fall armyworm on the affected crop. This automated system will save the farmer's time, as it will monitor the crops while the farmer is occupied with other activities. Lastly the system will help to increase the production of maize in Rwanda since the crop will be safe from the pest. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Use cases could be long-range unmanned air transport, flight calibration, or surveillance missions. It is natural that, depending on weight and size, unmanned aircraft are going to use the existing ground infrastructure together with manned aircraft. However, it is also a well-known fact that remotely piloted or automatic/autonomous unmanned aircraft do not have the same abilities and behavior as manned aircraft. There is a need to achieve a safe, orderly and expeditious flow of a mixed traffic constellation even when more than one unmanned aircraft are involved in aerodrome operations at the same time. Unfortunately, due to a lack of international standardization and regulation, it is still unknown which abilities a commercial unmanned aircraft will have. This makes it very difficult to define operational procedures. In the frame of the SESAR 2020 project 'Surface Management Operations' (SuMO), a procedural concept for ground movements of unmanned aircraft together with manned aircraft was elaborated. This concept uses so called segmented standard taxi routes and aims at realizing mixed traffic with an equal level of safety compared to pure manned traffic as well as very low system requirements for unmanned aircraft systems. In November 2017, this concept was validated together with tower controllers, conventional pilots, remotely piloted aircraft operators and an air traffic management expert from the German Air Navigation Service Provider DFS in a gaming workshop over several days. The validation covered departures, arrivals and non-nominal situations like C2 link loss or lost communication. Results showed that this concept likely allows a fast and easy integration of unmanned aircraft systems. It was rated as very practical, realistic and acceptable in terms of safety, human performance and the key performance areas access and equity as well as interoperability. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Recent studies on depth completion have leveraged deep learning approaches applying traditional convolutional neural networks to prediction of invisible information in sparse and irregular inputs. Due to the lack of local and global structures such as object boundary cues, however, the predicted information results in unstructured and noisy depth maps. This paper presents a supervised depth completion method using an adversarial network based only on sparse inputs. In the presented method, a fully convolutional depth completion network, along with the adversarial network, is designed to find and correct inconsistencies between ground truth distributions and the resulting depth maps interpolated by the depth completion network. This leads to more realistic and structured depth images without compromising runtime performance of inference. Experimental results based on the KITTI depth completion benchmark show that the presented adversarial network method achieves about 60% improvements for the accuracy of inference and increases the rate of convergence during training. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This requires a detailed alignment of the axes' trajectories, but also a careful design of the overall discrete control. Finding an optimal control strategy manually, however, is difficult, as also many functional and safety requirements must be considered. We therefore propose an automated methodology that consists of three parts: (1) A scenario-based language to flexibly specify the discrete production system behavior, (2) an automated procedure to synthesize optimal control strategies from such specifications, including PLC code generation, and (3) a procedure for the detailed trajectory optimization.

In the process of UAVs performing these tasks, the bandwidth of the communication network will affect the task assignment results, then the problem of task allocation for multi-UAV teams under the condition of limited communication bandwidth is considered. For a target, UAVs need to perform reconnaissance, attack and assessment tasks in coordination. The Consensus-Based Bundle Algorithm(CBBA) requires each task is assigned to no more than one UAV, so this paper extends CBBA by duplicating cooperative tasks to modify the task list and adding a judgment mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of the duplicate tasks' allocation in order to achieve the purpose of allocating multiple UAVs to the same task. At the same time, this paper utilizes a bid warping link to improve the algorithm performance and applies CBBA in asynchronous environment to reduce communication burden.

The information can be provided solely from the organic sensors to the system, or completely external information sources, or a combination of both. In unmanned aerial systems (UAS) the desire for autonomy is growing as the ideas for security, delivery, information gathering, and other concepts are proposed in the private sector. However, such operations require the UAS to understand its own inherent capabilities, such as its maneuverability, and to understand the world around it, such as the projected flight-paths of nearby UASs and potential obstacles. With such autonomous operations, Level 3 fusion is necessary for the UAS to interpret available information in order to make decision about its own behavior to avoid collisions and optimize is mission criteria. One technique for Level 3 fusion is evidence accrual, where low level evidence is combined through a series levels of increasingly complex steps to achieve a highly evolved understanding. For autonomous systems such as UASs, the impacts of information on a decision can vary in intensity based on a variety of issues. For example, as another UAS approaches the threat of a collision increases until one cannot react to avoid a collision or cannot modify the course to cause a collision. The modification of the weighting between the system dynamics and the impact is a time-varying system identification problem. A fuzzy-logic-based approach to evidence accrual was developed and has been applied to Level 3 fusion problems such as UAS. However, the approach has been too limited for use in autonomous systems in that it either requires operator information for adaptation of the relationships and between decisions and lower level evidence or has been static. In this effort, the development of the approach to apply to the UAS collision avoidance problem is made, by providing linear weighting adaptation for the fuzzy-logic-based evidence accrual system.

However, the implementation of these sensors in an underwater environment is challenging because of signal uncertainties and strong signal attenuation. In this paper, we propose an underwater localization scheme with a sensor fusion of inertial navigation system (INS) and received signal strength of electromagnetic (EM) waves sensors. In the proposed sensor-fusion-based localization scheme, the UUV predicts its location by using INS based on dead-reckoning and corrects the predicted position by Kalman filter using EM waves sensor information when the UUV receives the signals of EM waves sensors in underwater wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme enables localization with high accuracy and high sampling rate during a long-term task. The results of an experiment performed in a basin environment shows the feasibility of the proposed scheme. The scheme achieved reliable localization accuracy by comparing the pre-measured ground-truth position and long-term navigation. These results show the feasibility of exploiting EM waves attenuation as Earth-fixed reference sensors. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Explorer1000 mounted two high-precision VBSs on its bow and stern can reach neutral buoyancy, thus maintain constant depth or altitude for a long time. In order to increase endurance, Explorer1000 remains supervision and standby state with neutral buoyancy. At the moment, most of energy-consuming equipments are shut off and only a depthometer, an altimeter and an energy-efficient microcontroller in place of autopilot control unit (ACU) to monitor AUV’s safety such as distance from seabed and water leakage, etc. The scheme is able to guarantee AUV to carry out scientific missions over periods of weeks. If Explorer1000 regulates to neutral buoyancy before sailing, it can accomplish cruising with zero angle of attack that minimizes drag and saves energy effectively. Last but not least, Explorer1000 can achieve two observation modes including long-term observation in situ and cruising observation for multiple required sites. The rudder and propeller system is mainly used for most maneuverability in horizontal and vertical plane, while VBSs play a primary role in accurate vertical motion. Recently, Explorer1000 successfully completed one lake trial and two sea trials. In May 2015, Explorer1000 was fitted with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP), Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) sensor, Optical Dissolved Oxygen (ODO) sensor, Turbidity (Tu) sensor, chlorophyll sensor and so on and carried out its first field trial in Qiandao Lake of China.

For the part of trajectory tracking, functional redundancies among all available actuators provide an opportunity to reduce safety requirements for single actuators. Yet, the exploitation of functional redundancies must be well argued if employed in a safety concept as physical limits can be reached. In this paper, we want to examine from a trajectory tracking perspective whether such a concept can be used. For this, we present a model predictive fault-tolerant trajectory tracking approach for over-actuated vehicles featuring wheel individual all-wheel drive, brakes, and steering. Applying this approach exemplarily demonstrates for a selected reference trajectory that degradations such as missing or undesired wheel torques as well as reduced steering dynamics can be compensated. Degradations at the physical actuator limits lead to significant deviations from the reference trajectory while small constant steering angles are partially critical. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) has recently been shown to learn representative human driver models. These human driver models were learned through training in single-agent environments, but they have difficulty in generalizing to multi-agent driving scenarios. We argue these difficulties arise because observations at training and test time are sampled from different distributions. This difference makes such models unsuitable for the simulation of driving scenes, where multiple agents must interact realistically over long time horizons. We extend GAIL to address these shortcomings through a parameter-sharing approach grounded in curriculum learning. Compared with single-agent GAIL policies, policies generated by our PS-GAIL method prove superior at interacting stably in a multi-agent setting and capturing the emergent behavior of human drivers. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Contemporary landmines replace previously metal components with plastics, wood and glass to avoid detection. The situation has required increasingly sensitive metal detection equipment which may not always be available or effective. However, the internal explosives material has remained largely consistent. This paper exploits the changing thermal mass of this explosives material as it is heated by the sun, cooling at a delayed rate of the surrounding soil temperature. This change is recorded and measured by a thermal camera attached to an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) over several diurnal cycles, and then analyzed to identify the location of a buried landmine. A series of thermal images of surrogate landmines captured in October-November 2017, revealed clear shapes, with >2 Kelvin thermal differences to their surroundings. This indicates that UAV thermal imaging can be used for landmine detection. The techniques and method presented in this paper can be easily replicated, resulting in the identification, removal of dormant landmines in most environments, saving lives and reducing casualties. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

If a task requires a power beyond this capacity, or is performed repeatedly over long periods, such limits may be exceeded, which can cause inevitable robot damage and contribute to the lost productivity. In such cases, where hardware solutions and improvements are not applicable, effective software frameworks can prolong robot productivity and lifetime. To this end, in this paper we propose a novel technique for the monitoring and management of robot fatigue in repetitive or high-effort task execution scenarios. The robot fatigue is estimated by the measured temperature of motors in the joints. The proposed fatigue management system is composed of two-stage reaction process that is triggered by different levels of the estimated fatigue. The first stage exploits the kinematic redundancy of robot structure in attempt to minimise the load in the specific joints that under fatigue by reconfiguration in the joint space through the null space of the Cartesian task production. If the first stage is not successful in reducing the fatigue, the second stage is activated that gradually reduces the forces of hybrid controller. At that point, the human co-worker can temporarily take over the task execution until the robot will be recovered from the excessive fatigue. To validate the proposed approach we conducted experiments on KUKA Lightweight Robot performing two interaction tasks: autonomous surface wiping and collaborative human-robot surface polishing. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This method is based on both Lyapunov Krasovskii functional and dynamic behavior of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The proposed hybrid method considers, as a preliminary step, a statistical signature of the traffic exchanged in the network. By looking up this signature in a bank of signatures, it is possible to characterize the different anomalies that can be observed in UAV networks. Consequently, the different signatures that we can process, based on the different types of intrusion we generate in the network, are used to select the accurate model for robust control estimation. This selection is conducted by choosing a specific controller / observer among a dedicated bank of models. The first statistical signature extraction of the analyzed traffic is done with a multi-fractal analysis. This solution based on wavelet analysis has been selected because it offers a wide spectral characterization of the entire traffic process. The wavelet-based analysis methodology has been widely used for the last decade for Internet traffic characterization but this is the first time that this tool has been used on a UAV ad hoc network traffic. Moreover, several research studies on network anomaly estimation have been carried out using automatic control techniques. These studies provide methods for designing both observer and command laws dedicated to time delay problems while estimating the anomaly or intrusion in the system. As a first result, the spectral analysis tool has provided clearly distinguishable signatures between the traffics with and without anomalies. Then, the designed controller / observer system has been successfully applied to some relevant practical problems such as ad hoc networks for aerial vehicles and its effectiveness is illustrated by using real traffic traces including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Our first results show promising perspectives for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in a fleet of UAVs. Indeed, different types of anomaly have been considered and they are all accurately detected by the intrusion detection process we propose in this paper. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, the state estimation process for monitoring AV dynamics, in presence of CP attacks, is analyzed and a novel adversarial deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to maximize the robustness of AV dynamics control to CP attacks. The attacker's action and the AV's reaction to CP attacks are studied in a game-theoretic framework. In the formulated game, the attacker seeks to inject faulty data to AV sensor readings so as to manipulate the inter-vehicle optimal safe spacing and potentially increase the risk of AV accidents or reduce the vehicle flow on the roads. Meanwhile, the AV, acting as a defender, seeks to minimize the deviations of spacing so as to ensure robustness to the attacker's actions. Since the AV has no information about the attacker's action and due to the infinite possibilities for data value manipulations, each player uses long short term memory (LSTM) blocks to learn the expected spacing deviation resulting from its own action and feeds this deviation to a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Then, the attacker's RL algorithm chooses the action which maximizes the spacing deviation, while the AV's RL algorithm seeks to find the optimal action that minimizes such deviation. Simulation results show that the proposed adversarial deep RL algorithm can improve the robustness of the AV dynamics control as it minimizes the intra-AV spacing deviation. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we propose to use 3-D recurrent neural networks (RNN) to extract rich spatial context information of different resolutions to improve the accuracy of pedestrian detection. Recurrent neural networks have been shown to improve the performance for many tasks like speech recognition by exploiting the dependency between inputs at different time steps. However, the chain structure in conventional RNN is not very suitable for 2-D image tasks. The proposed 3-D RNN has a multi-path structure that enables the context aggregation between not only the neighboring cells but also feature map of different resolutions and abstraction levels. The context extracted in this way is rich because both the spatial dependency on the same feature map and the information across different feature maps are taken into account. By combining the 3-D RNN with skip-pooling, this method can detect multi-scale pedestrians under complex driving scenarios. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed method has a competitive performance, with an average precision of 73.04% on KITTI dataset, and a miss rate of 9.31% on Caltech dataset. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, the use of GAN does not provide much attention on the signal classification problem. In the context of using wireless signals to classify illegal Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), this paper explores the feasibility of using GAN to improve the training datasets and obtain a better classification model, thereby improving the accuracy of classification. First, we use the generative model of GAN to generate a large datasets, which does not need manual annotation. At the same time, the discriminative model of GAN is improved to classify the types of signals based on the loss function of the discriminative model. Finally, this model can be used to the outdoor environment and obtain a real-time illegal UAVs signal classification system. Our experiments confirmed that the improvements on the Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (AC-GANs) by limited datasets achieve excellent results. The recognition rate can reach more than 95% in the indoor environment, and this method is also applicable in the outdoor environment. Moreover, based on the theory of Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) and AC-GANs, a more robust Auxiliary Classifier Wasserstein GANs (AC-WGANs) model is obtained, which is suitable for multi-class UAVs. Through the combination of AC-WGANs and Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) B210 software defined radio (SDR) platform, a real-time UAVs signal classification system is also implemented. © 2018 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The framework exploits the abundance of satellite imagery, along with established computer vision and deep learning methods, to locate the UAV in a satellite imagery map. It utilizes the contextual information extracted from the scene to attain increased geolocalization accuracy and enable navigation without the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS), which is advantageous in GPS-denied environments and provides additional enhancement to existing GPS-based systems. The framework inputs two images at a time, one captured using a UAV-mounted downlooking camera, and the other synthetically generated from the satellite map based on the UAV location within the map. Local features are extracted and used to register both images, a process that is performed recurrently to relate UAV motion to its actual map position, hence performing preliminary localization. A semantic shape matching algorithm is subsequently applied to extract and match meaningful shape information from both images, and use this information to improve localization accuracy. The framework is evaluated on two different datasets representing different geographical regions. Obtained results demonstrate the viability of proposed method and that the utilization of visual information can offer a promising approach for unconstrained UAV navigation and enable the aerial platform to be self-aware of its surroundings thus opening up new application domains or enhancing existing ones. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

A growing segment of usage is of a dubious nature for harassment, illegal activity and terrorism. Detection of unknown UAV’s has become a requirement for many organizations and agencies to thwart the emergence of UAV’s that are in some way threatening. To detect UAV, the use of acoustic signals has become an useful area of research. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are one of several models of deep learning, applied in various fields such as image recognition and natural language processing. In this project, we design a system to detect the presence of possible detection and payload detection using CNNs on the basis of sound data generated from UAV flights. The sound of recorded drones is pre-processed into spectral data by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Mel-Frequency Cepstrum (MFCC) and given as the input value to the CNN model. The results show that it is possible to detect and differentiate UAVs which have standard weight and also with additional payload. In short, the project has two detection goals. One is the acoustic detection of a UAV, and the second is the determination if that UAV has a payload. © ICROS.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The latter challenge is of high importance if accurate execution is required, especially considering the floating nature of the AUV and the control challenges that come with it. Our approach relies on exploiting the loose coupling between the AUV and the arm. In particular we present an approach based on MR-MHA ∗ (Multi-Representation, Multi-Heuristic A∗), and we show how it can generate efficient trajectories by exploiting decoupling. We show for the first time the use of a search-based planner on a high-dimensional underwater manipulator. In addition, we support our claims with experimental analysis of the generated trajectories with respect to various metrics in different environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our approach to conduct a full intervention mission in a realistic simulated underwater intervention environment. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The goal of the defenders (UAV/UGV team) is to stop all attackers as quickly as possible, before they arrive at their selected goal. The uncertainty considered is twofold: the defenders do not know the attackers' location and destination, and there is also uncertainty in the defenders' sensing. We suggest a real-time algorithmic framework for the defenders, combining entropy and stochastic-temporal belief, that aims at optimizing the probability of a quick and successful capture of all of the attackers. We have empirically evaluated the algorithmic framework, and have shown its efficiency and significant performance improvement compared to other solutions. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Affinity and selectivity for the target compounds can be modulated by modifying the chemical structure of the nanoparticle-coating molecules (cationic thiols). Such nanoreceptors have been used to develop sensor arrays in combination with different commercially available fluorescent dyes. The combined systems were tested for the detection and discrimination of four kinds of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The discriminatory capability of the sensing systems has been evaluated through pattern recognition methods, principle component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The results showed that the systems here reported are able to identify the four kinds of NSAIDs with 100% accuracy in a quantitative way. The sensing system is capable of detecting the target drugs at micromolar concentration, discriminating both analyte identity and amount. In addition, the proposed sensor array is able to detect the four kinds of NSAIDs in a commercial tablet or in artificial urine. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Due to the recent success of generative adversarial networks (GAN), there has been much interest in probabilistic estimation and synthetic data generation using deep neural network architectures and learning algorithms. We propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for probabilistic human motion prediction, trained with a modified version of improved Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN-GP), in which we use a custom loss function designed for human motion prediction. Our model, which we call HP-GAN, learns a probability density function of future human poses conditioned on previous poses. It predicts multiple sequences of possible future human poses, each from the same input sequence but a different vector z drawn from a random distribution. Furthermore, to quantify the quality of the non-deterministic predictions, we simultaneously train a motion-quality-assessment model that learns the probability that a given skeleton sequence is a real human motion. We test our algorithm on two of the largest skeleton datasets: NTURGB-D and Human3.6M. We train our model on both single and multiple action types. Its predictive power for long-term motion estimation is demonstrated by generating multiple plausible futures of more than 30 frames from just 10 frames of input. We show that most sequences generated from the same input have more than 50% probabilities of being judged as a real human sequence.

Integrated UAV waypoints guidance scheme based on carrot chasing guidance law is presented. In order to follow a desired path a Virtual Track Point (VTP) is introduced on the path and make the UAV chase it. The UAV updates its heading direction toward the VTP. As time progresses, the UAV will move toward the path and asymptotically follow the path. Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) awards the flight control system researchers a straight forward method of deriving control laws for nonlinear systems. The control inputs are used to cancel unwanted terms in the equations of motion using negative feedback of these terms. The two-timescale assumption that separates the fast dynamics which are the three angular rates of the aircraft from the slow dynamics which include the angle of attack, side-slip angle, and bank angle is adopted. NDI control law is designed for the fast variables using the deflection of aerodynamic control surfaces as inputs. Next, NDI is applied to the control of the slow states using the outputs of the fast loop as inputs. Simulation results for the nonlinear flight control system are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the technique. The validation of the designed flight system controller is demonstrated through real flight test. © ICROS.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

We propose a novel two-stream convolutional network for motion segmentation, which exploits flow and geometric cues to balance the accuracy and computational efficiency trade-offs. The geometric cues take advantage of the domain knowledge of the application. In case of mostly planar scenes from high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), homography compensated flow is used. While in the case of urban scenes in autonomous driving, with GPS/IMU sensory data available, sparse projected depth estimates and odometry information are used. The network provides 4.7 speedup over the state of the art networks in motion segmentation from 153ms to 36ms, at the expense of a reduction in the segmentation accuracy in terms of pixel boundaries. This enables the network to perform real-time on a Jetson T2. In order to recuperate some of the accuracy loss, geometric priors is used while still achieving a much improved computational efficiency with respect to the state-of-the-art. The usage of geometric priors improved the segmentation in UAV imagery by 5.2 % using the metric of IoU over the baseline network. While on KITTI-MoSeg the sparse depth estimates improved the segmentation by 12.5 % over the baseline.

To benefit from these maps, precise localization is necessary. Localization enables the vehicle to drive along planned trajectories using map information like lane geometry and static environment information. State-of-the-art localization methods often use feature based maps or rely on dense appearance based maps for direct, association free matching. In this paper we combine both ideas. We solve the localization problem by matching dense measurement grids from LiDAR sensors directly against a geometrical, feature based map. Reflectivity and occupancy grids are obtained from multiple Li-DAR sensors. In order to avoid information reduction through feature extraction, the low-level grids are registered directly against a high-level geometrical map (Fig. 1). This new concept is solved using an exhaustive search in combination with a multi-level-resolution search. Real-time capable registration is achieved by exploiting the computational power of modern GPUs. To realize an online localizer, a Kalman Filter (KF) fuses the registration results with odometry information, obtained from serial production sensors. To ensure a fixed runtime, the registration resolution is adapted based on the state uncertainty. The robustness and accuracy of the developed methods is evaluated in extensive experiments. The localization proved to be accurate and robust against challenging situations like difficult maneuvers or missing localization features in the map. Thus, our new approach is well suited for autonomous driving applications. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Especially in autonomous driving systems, it allows for a full understanding of the system's surroundings, which is crucial for trajectory planning. Typical approaches to tackle this problem involve either the training of deep networks on vast amounts of images to directly infer the labels or the use of probabilistic graphical models to jointly model the dependencies of the input (i.e. images) and output (i.e. labels). Yet, the former approaches do not capture the structure of the output labels, which is crucial for the performance of dense labeling, and the latter rely on carefully hand-designed priors that require costly parameter tuning via optimization techniques, which in turn leads to long inference times. To alleviate these restrictions, we explore how to arrive at dense semantic pixel labels given both the input image and an initial estimate of the output labels. We propose a parallel architecture that: 1) exploits the context information through a LabelPropagation network to propagate correct labels from nearby pixels to improve the object boundaries, 2) uses a LabelReplacement network to directly replace possibly erroneous, initial labels with new ones, and 3) combines the different intermediate results via a Fusion network to obtain the final per-pixel label. We experimentally validate our approach on two different datasets for semantic segmentation, where we show improvements over the state-of-the-art. We also provide both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the generated results. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Shoulder-surfing attacks, such as card skimming, PIN capturing using fake machines or fake PIN pads, are the most common methods used by adversaries to capture data from the magnetic stripe on the back of the ATM card. The main problem lies in the existing static PIN-based authentication mechanism which does not provide any security measure (besides displaying asterisks when an user enters a preassigned PIN to the ATM). In this paper, we give a novel approach called DynamicPIN for secure ATM authentication, which is resilient to shoulder-surfing attacks. DynamicPIN is very simple, does not require any hardware changes, and does not pose any significant overhead to the system. A realtime experimental study showed that DynamicPIN improves significantly the ATM authentication compared to the existing static PIN-based authentication mechanism. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

If these limits are reached or exceeded, the system will no longer be able to manage the existing traffic volume. In order to avoid this situation, different actions can be undertaken such as expanding the network or increasing it's efficiency. Another possible action is the exploitation of a further (third) dimension for locomotion for decoupling from the systematical limits of the existing, ground-based structures. This work addresses a currently upcoming topic: the automated air mobility. Bringing such mobility offers to reality requires work in different fields. Among others, these are especially the integration of the mobility offer into the existing transport infrastructure as well as the integration of a human user into the automated aircraft. The paper contributes to both of these fields. Initially, we analyse requirements on urban airfields and examine existing as well as possible future urban airfields. Secondly, we take a closer look at the interaction of human users and automated aircraft building on knowledge and experiences from human-computer interaction in autonomous cars. This foundation is supplemented by aspects that emerge in the field of air traffic (e.g., required off-board coordination with the air traffic management). Finally, on this basis, we develop a proposal for the human-machineinteraction in automated aircraft. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Traditional traffic control tools, such as SCOOT and SCATS, are widely exploited in major cities, but given the increasing traffic demands, they need to be complemented with additional mechanisms. Within this context, the emerging interest in autonomous vehicles (AVs) points to the direction of a paradigm shift in the way in which traffic is controlled and managed. This is due to the fact that AVs can exploit different types of communication, hence take better informed decisions. Despite the amount of work dedicated to engineering solutions for supporting and implementing the different types of vehicular communication, there is a lack of analysis focusing on the implications of exploiting one (or more) type of communication. In this work, focusing on urban areas, we provide a principled and detailed analysis of the impact of different kinds of communication on reasoning capabilities of vehicles and of urban traffic control (e.g. level of deliberation).

Using a highly maneuverable, dynamic, six-legged (or flippered) vehicle to swim underwater, we exploit real time visual feedback to make close-range navigation decisions that would be hard to achieve with other sensors. Our approach uses computer vision as the sole mechanism for both collision avoidance and visual target selection. In particular, we seek to swim close to the reef to make observations while avoiding both collisions and barren, coral-deprived regions. To carry out path selection while avoiding collisions, we use monocular image data processed in real time. The proposed system uses a convolutional neural network that takes an image from a forward-facing camera as input and predicts unscaled and relative path changes. The network is trained to encode our desired obstacle-avoidance and reef-exploration objectives via supervised learning from human-labeled data. The predictions from the network are transformed into absolute path changes via a combination of a temporally-smoothed proportional controller for heading targets and a low-level motor controller. This system enables safe and autonomous coral reef navigation in underwater environments. We validate our approach using an untethered and fully autonomous robot swimming through coral reef in the open ocean. Our robot successfully traverses 1000 m of the ocean floor collision-free while collecting close-up footage of coral reefs. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

As one application, PLC is being used for monitoring and control in distribution networks. In this paper, we propose an autonomous technique that exploits the communication channel estimated inside legacy PLC modems to determine the health of distribution cables. In particular, we consider paper insulated lead covered (PILC) cables widely used in low and medium voltage distribution networks that are most susceptible to thermal degradations. Measurement campaigns have shown that these thermal degradations cause dielectric property changes in PILC cable insulations, which also result in changes in PLC channel conditions. However, through channel characterization of healthy and degraded cables, we demonstrate that the estimated channel frequency responses are not sufficiently distinctive for manual diagnosis. We therefore propose a machine-learning based technique that not only achieves our set target, but is also able to estimate the cable health under varying load conditions. Simulation results show that our proposed technique accurately estimates thermal degradation severities in PILC cables. We thus believe that PLC based cable health monitoring can be used as an autonomous remote diagnostics method that can be integrated into a smart-grid concept and has the promise of being more cost-effective than deploying personnel and/or dedicated equipment. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

We propose to use unsupervised machine learning to train neural networks to solve the modeling problem. The models learn a small set of intuitive parameters without the need for labeled data and use them to generate new realistic trajectories. The neural networks, which base on the InfoGAN and beta-VAE architectures, are adapted from the image domain to the time series domain. Although our methods are generally applicable, our experiments focus on lane change maneuvers on highways. To train the networks, we use more than 5600 measured lane change trajectories extracted from the highD dataset. Our results show that the networks learn to describe lane change maneuvers by up to four intuitive parameters. Furthermore, the networks are able to map existing lane change trajectories to values of the learned parameters and generate new, previously unseen, realistic trajectories.

CAPTCHA identifies bots from legitimate human users by requiring some questions that are easy for humans to solve but difficult for bots. However, the progress of computing technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) function. bots come to be able to solve present CAPTCHAs. In order to outcome such troublesome bots, more sophisticated CAPTCHA that requires the high cognitive ability of human beings is desired. In this paper, we propose a new CAPTCHA scheme that uses random dot patterns. Human beings can recognize a moving figure filled by a random dot pattern from a background that is filled by another random dot pattern; however, they lose the figure in the background when the figure pauses. Since image recognition by computer programs is usually carried out frame by frame, it is hard for bots to recognize such a moving figure filled by a random dot pattern from another random dot pattern background. The proposed CAPTCHA scheme exploits this characteristic of random dot patterns. This CAPTCHA requires users to answer a text filled by a random dot pattern that is moving on a background also filled by another random dot pattern. Several experiments were carried out to confirm that the proposed CAPTCHA scheme has enough resistance against bot attacks using representative image recognition methods. Results of the experiments showed that the image recognition methods cannot find out the answer text. Other experiments were also carried out to evaluate the usability of the proposed CAPTCHA scheme. The system usability scheme was adopted in the experiments. The obtained score was 89 that means this CAPTCHA scheme has high usability. These results showed that the CAPTCHA scheme is usable enough and has enough resistance against bot attacks. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In the automotive domain, the security has a direct impact on the user's safety. Thus, the management of risk is becoming the main concern of automotive manufacturers, especially for the future fully connected and autonomous cars. A possible way to quantify the overall risk of a system is the systematic construction of attack graphs and attack trees. These formalisms are presented as one of the possible solutions in the new Cybersecurity Guidebook for Cyber-Physical Vehicle Systems (SAE-J3061). In this chapter we propose to use graph transformation to formally model the car architecture and its state evolution in order to study cyberphysical attacks against it. The resulting attacks are converted into attack trees which are used to estimate the overall risk of the system. Consequently, it becomes possible to study improvements while building a more secure architecture.

"Robust filter setting in GPS-based relative positioning of small-satellite LEO formations","2018","Advances in Space Research","10.1016/j.asr.2018.03.020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044514474&doi=10.1016%2fj.asr.2018.03.020&partnerID=40&md5=fa4aa94cfb450afaa8c71834dd408fb6","Formations of small satellites are becoming more and more important to many space applications, since they offer the possibility of distributing the payload functionality among the different elements of the formation, so to improve scientific return, providing at the same time a number of advantages in terms of overall system reliability, flexibility and modularity. However, precise autonomous determination of the relative positions of the formation members is required for formation acquisition and maintenance, and scientific objective achievement. For Low-Earth-Orbit formations, this task can be performed exploiting GPS-based relative positioning techniques. The technique exploited in this paper is designed for on board usage. It processes double differenced pseudo-range and carrier phase observables on two frequencies within a hybrid filtering scheme to get satisfactory precision and high robustness. However, relative positioning by GPS is affected by the capability of correctly estimating differential ionospheric delays, and, then, by the status of ionosphere activity. Hence, the filter includes an ionospheric model capable of reproducing ionosphere horizontal gradients with a minimum number of parameters, which can be estimated on the fly. In addition, a robust tuning approach is developed in the paper to get stable filter performance over long period of times. Specifically, the proposed approach combines an empirical tuning technique with a randomized algorithm to get the best filter tuning. Filter performance and tuning approach effectiveness are successfully verified using freely available GPS flight data of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment mission. © 2018 COSPAR","Article","Final","Scopus"
"Effects of vehicular communication on risk assessment in automated driving vehicles","2018","Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","10.3390/app8122632","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058518487&doi=10.3390%2fapp8122632&partnerID=40&md5=4f364832050306c7ad9a0d0dc35df6e7","This paper proposes a human-centered risk assessment algorithm designed to find the intervention moment of drive mode and active safety mode while monitoring threat vehicles ahead to overcome effects of vehicular communication on risk assessment in automated driving vehicle. Although a conventional radar system is known to be best fitted on-board ranging sensor in terms of longitudinal safety, it is generally not enough for a reliable automated driving because of sensing uncertainty of the traffic environments and incomplete perception results due to sensor limitations. This can be overcome by implementing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication which provides complementary source of target vehicle's dynamic behavior. Using V2V communication with vehicle internal and surround information obtained from the on-board sensor system, future vehicle motion has been predicted. With accurately predicted motion of a remote vehicle, a collision risk and the automated drive mode are determined by incorporating human factor. Effects of the V2V communication on a human-centered risk assessment algorithm have been investigated through a safe triangle analysis. The computer simulation studies have been conducted in order to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. It has been shown that the V2V communication with the proposed risk assessment algorithm allows a faster drive mode decision and active safety intervention moment. © 2018 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"Environmental Load of Iron Ore Transportation, Bayan Obo Mine, China","2018","IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science","10.1088/1755-1315/208/1/012004","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059652922&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f208%2f1%2f012004&partnerID=40&md5=4cfe89943c026231226d4b0053df9468","The Bayan Obo Mine in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, is the largest rare earth ore deposit in the world. The Baotou Iron and Steel Group (Baotou Steel) is in charge of the exploitation. Every year, approximately 12 million tons of ore are transported from the mine to the Baotou Steel factory by rail for dressing and smelting. The transportation of these massive quantities of ore has a large environmental impact. Based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) method, this study explores the environmental impact of the railway transportation of ore from the Bayan Obo Mine. Our results indicate that the environmental impact is primarily due to the marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential (MAETP), the abiotic depletion potential of fossil fuels (ADP fossil), and the acidification potential (AP). The environmental impact of the production of raw materials is much greater than that of the railway transportation. Our sensitivity analysis indicates that environmental impact is most sensitive to changes in the amount of diesel fuel used. The annual greenhouse gas emissions is 52.22 million tons, which is approximately 0.45% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in China in 2017. In particular, the direct emission from this transportation is 1.7 million tons, which is approximately 0.007% of the country's total emissions and 0.3% of Inner Mongolia's total emissions. A comparison of our study and the European Union railway demonstrates that in both cases, the environmental impacts are primarily due to MAETP, ADP fossil, and global warming potential (GWP). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
"Probabilistic Collision Threat Assessment for Autonomous Driving at Road Intersections Inclusive of Vehicles in Violation of Traffic Rules","2018","IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","10.1109/IROS.2018.8593645","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063009429&doi=10.1109%2fIROS.2018.8593645&partnerID=40&md5=0bf1c216e5a1e2489eaad34cc82dd35b","In this paper, we propose a probabilistic collision threat assessment algorithm for autonomous driving at road intersections that assesses a given traffic situation at an intersection reliably and robustly for an autonomous vehicle to cross the intersection safely, even in the face of violation vehicles (that is, vehicles in violation of traffic rules at the intersection). To this end, the proposed algorithm employs a detailed digital map to predict future paths of observed vehicles and then utilizes the predicted future paths to identify potential threats (vehicles) and potential collision areas, regardless of whether observed vehicles are obeying traffic rules at the intersection. Next, by means of Bayesian networks and time window filtering under an independent and distributed reasoning structure, it assesses the potential threats regarding the possibility of collision reliably and robustly, even under uncertain and incomplete noise data. Then, it has been tested and evaluated through in-vehicle testing on a closed urban test road under traffic conditions inclusive of non-violation and violation vehicles. In-vehicle testing results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is sufficiently reliable to be used in decision-making for autonomous driving at intersections in terms of reliability and robustness, even in the face of violation vehicles. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The idea is to use ray-tracing simulation and Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) to build a geographic information database that reproduces the 'site-specific' multipath patterns that enhance the position estimation performance in multipath scenarios. The conventional emitter location systems based on TDoA sensors mitigate errors trying to avoid NLoS measurements, while the proposed method, uses the multipath information to extract the time of arrival characteristic from the environment. A measurement campaign was done to validate the technique and showed an enhancement in the localization processing, depending on the precision of the buildings and obstacles information. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

By analyzing the status information of the UAV group, the most important UAV (key nodes) is selected to avoid collisions, and at the same time, the robustness minimum principle is adopted to select the collision avoidance direction. Simulation results of the two typical UAV flight cases show that this strategy can not only effectively solve the current conflict problem of UAVs, but also prevent chain collisions and achieve overall optimization. Quantitative simulation experiments are conducted to validate the feasibility and scalability of the proposed algorithm. Compared with the random choose direction collision algorithm, the results show that this algorithm can indeed improve the safety of the UAV group. © 2018, Press of Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.

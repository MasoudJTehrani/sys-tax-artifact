"Shot boundary detection using logarithmic intensity histogram: An application for video retrieval","2017","International Journal of Applied Engineering Research","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057641483&partnerID=40&md5=aa098b5e73b0628eb21a12d0a8334727","This paper presents automated shot boundary detection for video retrieval applications that exploits the logarithmic histogram of intensity to extract intensity histogram features from video frames. The proposed algorithm has the main purpose of identifying appropriate boundaries between shots of a video. In the first step, logarithmic histogram of the video frame is obtained with mapping of pixel intensity to an appropriate logarithmic level. This quantization process maps the image features into logarithmic histogram. To find shot boundaries between video frames, video frames are compared sequentially using logarithmic histogram and absolute difference. Extreme change between content of two successive frames considered if higher value of disparity is obtained. In lieu of statistical threshold, frame rate is used for identifying shot boundaries. If detected video shot having frames less than frame rate then boundary is not considered as a shot boundary and frames are clubbed with previously detected shot. Videos from various categories like sports, news and cartoon are used to evaluate the performance of proposed technique. It shows significant detection of boundaries having sharp transition. Method evaluated with 30 video sets and it is observed method performs very well with good rate of Hit and lesser number of Miss. As threshold is frame rate, it performs very well even in case of gradual shot boundaries. Proposed algorithm has also been evaluated on standard database TRECVID 2001 with good figure of Recall and Precision. Its performance is evaluated using on video retrieval application with 24Video sets from three different categories sports, Cartoons and News. © Research India Publications.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"Autonomous system for rapid airfield assessment","2017","AIAA Information Systems-AIAA Infotech at Aerospace, 2017","10.2514/6.2017-1158","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088772525&doi=10.2514%2f6.2017-1158&partnerID=40&md5=97d375c5185f11d2d755e504211dcc66","Regenerating sorties after an airfield has been attacked is a significant concern for the United States Air Force. Growing power projection and strike capabilities of potential adversaries place existing air bases susceptible to attack and accompanying damage. Even un-sophisticated attacks can render an airfield inoperable for many hours, and prevent the launch of aircraft during a conflict. Therefore, technologies were sought to improve the ability to return an airbase to a minimum acceptable operational capability after such an attack. When damage is incurred, the local forces perform an assessment of the runway, dispose of unexploded ordnance (UXO), then perform repairs. This work focuses on applying advanced autonomous technologies to improve the post-strike assessment task, which may provide the greatest return on investment in reducing total airfield down-time. A system is proposed consisting of a team of quad-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with thermal and optical sensors to identify recent damage. This system is shown, through analysis and scaled testing to decrease the airfield assessment time by 80%. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Because they have only several pixels isolated far from the background, while most of the existing stereo matching methods require a certain area of the support region to improve the robustness, or assume the depth dependence of the neighboring pixels to meet requirement of global or semi global optimization method. So there will be some false alarms even failures when images contains tiny wires. A new stereo matching algorithm is approved in the paper based on double components model. According to different texture types the input image is decomposed into two independent component images. One contains only sparse wire texture image and another contains all remaining parts. Different matching schemes are adopted for each component image pairs. Experiment proved that the algorithm can effectively calculate the depth image of complex scene of patrol UAV, which can detect tiny wires besides the large size objects. Compared with the current mainstream method it has obvious advantages. © 2018 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Over a dozen of the barrows were explored by professor Konrad Jazdzewski in the 1930s. The other ones are now completely levelled. The aerial survey was carried out on the area of the following villages: Obalki, Leœniczówka (currently Arciszewo), Lubomin, Smiely, and £ania (c.f W. Chmielewski 1952). In the summer of 2015, a survey over the valley of the Zglowiaczka river was conducted. It encompassed the villages of Dêby Janiszewskie and Janiszewo, which according to descriptions, contained numerous Kuyavian long barrows. The aerial surveys in search of Kuyavian long barrows are still in progress. Until now, almost 130 flights have been made, which resulted in nearly 7500 photographs taken. On the basis of the obtained results, it seems that the applied method is very effective. Thanks to the flights over Izbica Kujawska and Lubraniec, it was possible to locate 17 long barrows cemeteries at Dêby Janiszewskie, Janiszewo, Leœniczówka, Lubomin, Oba3;ki, Œmie3;y and £ania. The results obtained are relevant from the point of view of conservation works. As the long barrows are situated on arable land, they are gradually being destroyed and threatened with obliteration. © 2017 Lódzkie Towarzystwo Naukowe.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In mid-2015 following a major storm event, Council identified that coastal erosion was causing an immediate hazard to The Esplanade despite substantial beach scraping. The Esplanade was deemed to be at imminent threat of collapse into the ocean which necessitated the closure of this beachfront road. The Water Research Laboratory (WRL) of UNSW Sydney proposed the design of an interim geotextile sand container (GSC) seawall to mitigate further erosion which is outlined in this paper along with details of its construction. Ongoing monitoring, using UAS (unmanned aerial system or drone) surveying provided a cost-effective monitoring solution and allowed for coastal engineering analysis of sediment transport in the vicinity of the seawall. Based on visual observations and analysis of the data, the seawall combined with beach scraping has thus far been successful at managing the risk of the road being undermined. However, the underlying natural tendency for erosion at this site may continue which could require additional coastal engineering works. © Australasian Coasts and Ports 2017 Conference.

The ACDS which was proposed in the late 1970's is a centralized, automated command-and-control system and it upgrades the NTDS for aircraft carriers and large-deck amphibious ships. Former NTDs collected information from ship's active and passive sensors, correlates hostile tracks and provided an integrated display of air, surface and subsurface situations for the ships operations officer. The NTDS was located in the ship's combat information center. There are two basic steps to the upgrade of the Combat Direction System (CDS) systems currently employed on ships. We discuss two basic steps and amphibious operations for combined forces in Korea. The rogue North Korean regime is plowing ahead with its missile technology and there are escalating threats in Korea Peninsula. US and ROK combined forces may decide to establish a functional component command to integrate planning and to improve combat efficiency significantly by use of amphibious operations. The ACDS replaced the NTDS (Naval Tactical Data System) due to growth in operational requirements both in the areas of combat direction needs and Battle Group/Battle Force (BG/BF) command and control. An amphibious operation is a military operation which uses maneuver principles to transition ready-to-fight combat forces from the sea to the shore in order to obtain an advantage over a hostile nation. Interoperable information systems to provide timely dissemination of information for amphibious planning, rehearsals and execution are required. Amphibious operations require a flexible communications system to support rapid decision making and to maintain a high tempo of operations. It must be reliable, sufficient for the mission, flexible, sustainable and survivable. © Medwell Journals, 2017.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It is composed of a commercial hybrid ROV/AUV and a set of interchangeable payloads that feature a common power & data interface for data logging and intelligent autonomous mission online reprogramming, according to payload measurements or other external events. Clean Sea technology had been validated in extensive trials carried out in simulated and real oil & gas scenarios in 2014 and 2015: Lake Vattern (Sweden), Barents Sea, Caspian Sea, Mediterranean Sea. In 2015, Clean Sea system had completed the transition from research to operational applications with two pipeline network surveys in the Mediterranean Sea. Results obtained show high value of the technology developed by R&D, especially in terms of improved environmental monitoring and protection, high versatility thanks to the payload modularity, low logistics requirements with significant cost savings. Future offshore campaign are encouraged by the great number of available functionalities and new functionalities that may be combined to get the best possible result according to business needs. Considering two Clean Sea systems deployed in 2016, Eni is now in a position to better monitor its offshore installation and surrounding marine environment. The Mediterranean Sea and West Africa, where Eni directly operates its offshore installations, are the first locations where Eni has started using Clean Sea. A dedicated team has been set-up, trained and based in EniMed, Eni's subsidiary operating in Mediterranean area, who will manage Operating & Maintenance activities of the Clean Sea system.

First, because drones obviate the need to act in self-defense, they may be subjected to strict Rules of Engagement (ROE). Second, drones lower the costs of acting with restraint. Although unmanned vehicles are at a heightened risk of being damaged or destroyed if they are subjected to stricter ROE, their destruction does not carry the same risk of provoking casualty aversion as the loss of human soldiers. Third, drones make it easier to visually identify prospective targets before attacking them. This may help to prevent attacks on civilians or allied soldiers. © 2017, The Author(s).","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

Over the last four years, this technology has grown and matured from a level of skepticism to full maturity. One particular AMV glider harnesses kinetic energy from wave action to produce forward propulsion in an environmentally friendly manner. This glider is a hybrid sea-surface and underwater vehicle that has taken the concept of autonomy beyond that of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). This wave-powered sensor platform enables collection and transmission of data gathered at sea on missions lasting up to a year. It is capable of crossing thousands of kilometers of ocean to gather oceanographic data, as well as maintain a stationary position while taking meteorological readings, or it can circle a rig at a preset distance to provide early warning of security or environmental threats. Once deployed, the glider uses no crew, requires no fuel, and produces no emissions, thus eliminating both risks to personnel and impact on the environment. During a marine seismic survey, the worst possible nightmare is to have any of the seismic survey vessel assets, in particular the streamer spread, collide with the client's installations. This type of collision can occur due to metocean changes and feathering, unpredicted changes in the profile of currents, and the onset of cyclones and hurricanes. Typically, the knowledge of currents around platforms during seismic close pass acquisition (CPA) is provided by acoustic Doppler current profilers (ACDPs) that are bottom mounted on vessels that hold station just outside the 500-m exclusion zone, thus providing real-time currents information to help the seismic fleet navigate. This conventional method is an expensive use of the vessels held on station. Such vessels cost USD10 to 20 thousand per day, and typically these are chase vessels that have been pulled away from their primary duty, which is to chase away unwanted visitors in the area. The AMV provides an alternative; it replaces the vessel and performs the same work more efficiently at a much lower cost. At the same time, the AMV glider lowers HSE risk and reduces the environmental impact. To date, 35 missions have been completed using this technology, which has resulted in an operational savings of 2 to 3 days per month on average through better management of the CPA and line changes. Slowly, operators are accepting this technology as a viable replacement for vessel-mounted ADCPs. © 2017, SPE Health, Safety, Security, Environment, & Social Responsibility Conference - North America.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

A common phrase for this interaction is manned-unmanned teaming, a subset of which, for unmanned aerial vehicles, is the concept of the loyal wingman. Previous works established a definition and candidate scenario, demonstrated a methodology, formulated the optimal control problem, and developed dynamic and measurement update models for avoiding moving, stochastic threats. The work herein extends upon previous work by formulating the optimal control problem for a scenario more consistent with manned-unmanned teaming. Additional technical information is provided for appropriately modeling the moving, stochastic threats and a critical distance metric is developed to recommend when the loyal wingman’s optimal path should be updated, using speed and stochastics of the moving threat as well as relative distance and angle of approach of the loyal wingman to the threat. These techniques are demonstrated through simulation for computing the global outer-loop optimal path for a minimum time rendezvous with a manned lead while avoiding static as well as moving, non-deterministic threats, then updating the global outer-loop optimal path based on changes in the threat mission environment. Results demonstrate a methodology for rapidly computing an optimal solution to the loyal wingman optimal control problem. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The principle of self-help and the act of organising to provide mutual beneÀts have strong traditions in the labour movement. Westfund was a health fund established in 1953 by the Western District Branch of the Miners' Federation in Lithgow New South Wales, largely to provide medical beneÀts to miners․ Organised labour historically has also campaigned for state provision of welfare services. In Australia, the notion of “Labourism” refers to a particular approach adopted by organised labour whereby they represented their interests directly in the political sphere through the Australian Labor Party. When the labour movement achieved its aim of a more universal health care system under the Whitlam ALP government, Westfund chose to work within the system in order to survive. Mutualism and labourism co-existed. The subsequent introduction of Medicare by the Hawke ALP government brought changes which created a more threatening business environment for health funds. In this instance to mitigate the danger it posed to their business, Westfund chose to oppose more aggressively aspects of the universal health system. Westfund weakened its institutional ties to the labour movement, and became more autonomous from its roots as a mutual. © 2017 Australian Society for the Study of Labour History.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This equipment is designed under the principles of an integrated mechatronic device and is particularly useful for the intervention teams that have to respond to chemical and ecological incidents (accidents or terrorist attacks), as well as to the decision factors because it provides them, in a very short time, the necessary information to take urgent and informed action for the neutralization of the local factors generating the crisis (chemical war agents, toxic industrial compounds, explosives, drugs, etc.), for the protection of the personnel and the environment, for choosing the appropriate decontamination means and medical treatment. [1,2,3,4]. Taking into account the fact that in this type of interventions ‘time’ is very important, this system is necessary. The mechatronic equipment has been designed to process, in a short time, all kinds of samples (solid, liquid, gases or complex substances’ amalgams), integrating a number of preparation techniques: SPE (Solid Phase Extraction), SPME (Solid Phase Microextraction), Head Space, adsorption on TENAX adsorbent resin tubes etc. for the sample preparation on the spot. As a result, time and resource consuming activities are spared: sample collection, packing and labelling, transport to a specialized lab, classical testing in the lab. [5] From a scientific point of view, the use of SPE, SPME, Head Space techniques in the collection and processing of samples for the identification of organic pollutants does not represent an innovation, being successfully used for over 20 years. The innovation factor is brought by the utilization of this techniques for the collection and processing of samples contaminated with highly dangerous compounds from CWAs (chemical warfare agents) class in field situations, in an automatic manner. From a technological point of view, the main innovation is comprised of the integration of these separate techniques in an unitary mechatronic system which would comprise, besides extraction cartridges with different adsorbents, a collection system with an automatic pump, electronical control gadgets, sample heating gadget, time measuring gadget. Our mechatronic equipment comes in handy in the detection and identification of interest compounds, because the existent detection equipment can only identify substances in gas form, leaving the risk of not detecting the dangerous substances with low volatility. [6] Also, in the case of instrumental mechatronic techniques of analysis and identification of the compounds of interest the previous collection of samples is necessary in order to bring them in a state compatible with the analytic instrument, laborious process, that takes a lot of time and reagents in the case ‘’classical methods of process in lab”. © 2017, Cefin Publishing House.

Differing from previous works, in this article, we aim to distinguish between faults and attacks and develop an attack detection algorithm for the latter only. To do this, we note that there are two kinds of faults-transient and permanent; the former are benign and short-lived, whereas the latter may have dangerous consequences on system performance. We argue that sensors have an underlying transient fault model that quantifies the amount of time in which transient faults can occur. In addition, we provide a framework for developing such a model if it is not provided by manufacturers. Attacks can manifest as either transient or permanent faults depending on the attacker's goal.We provide different techniques for handling each kind. For the former, we analyze the worst-case performance of sensor fusion over time given each sensor's transient fault model and develop a filtered fusion interval that is guaranteed to contain the true value and is bounded in size. To deal with attacks that do not comply with sensors' transient fault models, we propose a sound attack detection algorithm based on pairwise inconsistencies between sensor measurements.

A neural network was trained on the MHP calibration ight data, which produced estimates of the angle of attack and sideslip from static pressure measurements made across the surface of the aircraft. The airspeed was measured from the dynamic pressure between stagnation and static ports on the fuselage. During a validation ight, mean errors between the distributed FADS and MHP were 0.12 m/s for indicated airspeed, 0:01° for angle of attack, and 0:10° for angle of sideslip. Additionally, 97.9% of the FADS indicated airspeed measurements were within -1 m/s of the MHP measurements, while 87.6% and 75.4% of the angles of attack and sideslip, respectively, were within ±1° of the MHP. Results show that a distributed FADS can be calibrated in ight, and is a viable option for performing relative wind sensing from small UAS. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

"Predicting scene parsing and motion dynamics in the future","2017","Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047019919&partnerID=40&md5=8cd9fe41883720e46d297a01cfdf5bd7","The ability of predicting the future is important for intelligent systems, e.g. autonomous vehicles and robots to plan early and make decisions accordingly. Future scene parsing and optical flow estimation are two key tasks that help agents better understand their environments as the former provides dense semantic information, i.e. what objects will be present and where they will appear, while the latter provides dense motion information, i.e. how the objects will move. In this paper, we propose a novel model to simultaneously predict scene parsing and optical flow in unobserved future video frames. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt in jointly predicting scene parsing and motion dynamics. In particular, scene parsing enables structured motion prediction by decomposing optical flow into different groups while optical flow estimation brings reliable pixel-wise correspondence to scene parsing. By exploiting this mutually beneficial relationship, our model shows significantly better parsing and motion prediction results when compared to well-established baselines and individual prediction models on the large-scale Cityscapes dataset. In addition, we also demonstrate that our model can be used to predict the steering angle of the vehicles, which further verifies the ability of our model to learn latent representations of scene dynamics. © 2017 Neural information processing systems foundation.

A multidisciplinary approach is necessary for merging properly with integrated structural actuation systems, starting from the early design development, then increasing the overall configuration complexity from the preliminary stages. There is a multiplicity of alternatives to the benchmark configuration. Structural morphing rose to prominence recently due to increasing demand for satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle performance, spurring many studies on the topic. Design implications aside, morphing wings give rise to a number of new manufacture, assembly, and verification challenges for structural systems. The number of components drastically increases as traditional frozen architectures are supplanted by kinematic chains or compliant systems. The increased number of parts comprising the mechanical system results in an increased number of difficulties, as well as an attendant increase in the required manufacturing effort and design attention devoted to tolerances and assembly. As a result, manufacture and design scientists are expected to cooperate even more than normal due to the massive growth in schematic complexity. Furthermore, because the structure is movable, special assembly rigs must be designed to preserve the kinematic possibilities and avoid local and permanent deformations. Specialized tools must be created to execute certain specific operations on these newly-complicated components. In this chapter, significant examples of the manufacture process of morphing wing components are illustrated. Specifically, attention is focused on technological projects such as the one in which Aernnova used their own background to develop innovations in the development of adaptive modules. Under the European Union's Seventh Programme project SARISTU, this approach permitted the creation of a full-scale wing section for operative wind tunnel tests. In 3AS and CURVED projects, Aernnova focused on developing structured materials with innovative characteristics suitable for integration in morphing constituents. These experiences have been exploited in the assessment of a breakthrough adaptive rudder. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

Gust soaring is a flight technique of energy harvesting in such a complex and stochastic domain. Presented work shows the feasibility and benefits of exploiting non-stationary environment for a small UAV. Longitudinal dynamics trajectory is derived showing significant benefits in extended flight with sinusoidal wind profile. Optimization strategy for active control has been performed with the aim of obtaining most effective set of gains for energy retrieval. Moreover, three-dimensional multi-point model confirmed feasibility of energy harvesting in a more complex spatial wind field. Influence of unsteady aerodynamics is determined on overall energy gain along the flight path with active proportional control. Most contributing aerodynamic parameters are identified and suggested as basic objective function of an UAV design for energy harvesting in gusty environment.

This study used the Kestrel computational fluid dynamics virtual flight test environment to predict the aerodynamic force and moment coefficients of a generic unmanned combat air vehicle to evaluate control surface effectiveness. The geometry under investigation is known as the MULDICON and is a redesigned delta-wing configuration of the SACCON/DLR- F19. The MULDICON is a full-scale version of the wind-tunnel-scale DLR-F19, with a modified trailing edge sweep angle to increase control surface effectiveness, and new airfoil sections based on the NACA 64A-010 airfoil to eliminate the DLR-F19’s undesireable nonlinear aerodynamics. Steady solutions were utilized to characterize the control surface effectiveness of the MULDICON geometry over four mission design points that represent low-speed, low-altitude tack-off and landing (Mach 0.2, sea level); mid-speed, low-altitude mission insertion (Mach 0.4, sea level); high-speed, low-altitude strike (Mach 0.8, sea level); and high-speed, high-altitude cruise (M0.8, 11km).

"A probabilistic approach for eol fracture analysis of subsea pipelines","2017","Rio Pipeline Conference and Exposition, Technical Papers","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044755361&partnerID=40&md5=52f11b59f902edc3777981a1f57a86a9","Most of modern subsea pipelines in South America and Europe had been designed according to DNV-OS-F101, published by Det Norske Veritas (DNV), which adopts a Load and Resistance Factor Design philosophy. In general, this approach makes use of partial safety factors derived from structural reliability analysis, in order to meet a given target probability of failure for each limit state and consequences of failure. The main purpose of this approach is to optimize the safety margins in design in order to increase feasibility and reliability of more complex pipelines. When Engineering Critical Assessment (ECA) is required, the standard adopts a deterministic fracture analysis approach, based on a Failure Assessment Diagram using lower-bound resistance and upper-bound load inputs. This approach, widely accepted in both nuclear and offshore industries, has been successfully adopted for a broad range of structures, saving tons of resources by avoiding catastrophic failures and unnecessary repairs. However, the reliability of such analysis is generally unknown. Probabilistic fracture mechanics has been a theme for study in both academy and industry for a long time. Most of guidelines of fracture analysis developed their models for reliability analysis. This paper reviews BS-7910 reliability analysis and evaluate them with a probabilistic approach for End of Life (EOL) fracture analysis of subsea pipeline. Commonly observed ECA input data, including Automated Ultrasonic Testing (AUT) probability of detection and sizing error, are also discussed. For the probabilistic fracture mechanics analysis, a Simple Monte Carlo Simulation was used instead of First Order Second Moment. As a result, no excess of conservativeness was identified for both deterministic and probabilistic analysis since the results agree in a satisfactory manner. The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to adopt such approach for structural integrity management of subsea pipelines are discussed and summarized. Besides the lack of a more extensive full-scale test program to evaluate model uncertainty, the methodology seems to be robust and promising. The real advantage of probabilistic fracture mechanics is to report results as an estimated probability of failure, which makes it a better tool for risk-wise decision making.

The guidance algorithms generate collision avoidance maneuvers based on estimated line-of-sight rates to one or more collision threats, derived from a monocular camera image. It is assumed that the collision threats are detected and tracked as feature points by an image processing algorithm, which provides the bearing angles to each threat, but not the range. The motion of each tracked threat in the image plane is then used to estimate the rate of change of the horizontal and vertical line-of-sight angles to each potential threat. The proportional navigation based guidance law generates collision avoidance commands when the line-of-sight rates to a given threat is close to zero, which would indicate a potential collision. This paper extends previous work, in which avoidance laws were developed for one or two dynamic collision threats, to focus on the case in which potentially numerous static and dynamic threats are present in the scene, as would be the case for UAV flight through a complex urban environment. Simulation results are presented using a full 6 degree-of-freedom UAV simulation model for several different implementations of the proportional navigation based avoidance laws in scenarios with multiple static and dynamic obstacles. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In this paper, a new efficient collision avoidance approach for uncertain threat environments derived from the idea of autonomous mental development is proposed. The proposed collision avoidance pattern consists of a sensory layer, a logic layer and a development layer. The threat information is sensed using the sensory layer, and the path planning approach in the logical layer is applied to the output configuration of UAV. In the development phase, the developmental networks approach is used for online learning, training and updating the logical layer so as to form the sense–action mapping, which is stored as the “basic experience” for UAV executing the avoidance manoeuvre. In the implementation phase, the command is executed by matching the sensing information and action base.

Simulations are performed for subsonic incompressible flows that are representative of typical flight conditions encountered by the vehicle in cruise. Finite wing results for two Reynolds numbers of 1.0×106 and 1.5×106 at angles of attack 0°, 2°, 4° and 6° over a range of quarter-chord sweep angles between -12° and 12° show that both methods are capable of producing results in very close agreement with high-fidelity data when it comes to estimating aerodynamic performance at a point. However, the maxima and minima on the lift, drag, and lift-to-drag with sweep angle curves differ significantly, suggesting that the finite wing models are capable of estimating, but not generalizing, the behavior of a three-dimensional geometric wing characteristic. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The marine environment limits the number of sensors available for precise localization, hence Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) usually rely on inertial and velocity sensors to obtain an estimate of their position either through dead reckoning or by means of more sophisticated navigation filters (such as Kalman filters and its extensions [1]). On the other hand, acoustic localization makes possible the determination of a reliable vehicles pose estimate exploiting suitable acoustic modems [3]; such estimate can even be integrated within the navigation filter of the vehicle in order to increase its accuracy. In this paper, the authors discuss the development and the performance of an Ultra-Short BaseLine (USBL)-aided buoy to improve the localization of underwater vehicles. At first, the components and the physical realization of the buoy will be discussed; then, the procedure to compute the position of the target will be analyzed. The following part of the paper will be focused on the development of a recursive state estimation algorithm to process the measurements computed by the buoy; specifically, Extended Kalman Filter [4] has been adopted to deal with the nonlinearities of the sensors housed on the buoy. A validation of the measurement filtering through experimental tests is also proposed. © 2017 International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering.

"Browsing the World with RFID tags: Design and implementation of an RFID-based distributed environmental memory","2017","RFID Handbook: Applications, Technology, Security, and Privacy","10.1201/9781420055009","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052565606&doi=10.1201%2f9781420055009&partnerID=40&md5=f96c02638b3f9d9ec848a6cfaed6e841","Advances in miniaturization of electronic devices and in wireless communication technologies are making possible to enrich our everyday environments (and the objects in it) with computation and communication capabilities [1]. The result may be an increased capability of interacting with the physical world, by acquiring in a digital form a number of information beyond our normal sensing capabilities. In the next few years, we will no longer simply browse the Web, but will be able to “browse the world” around us: we will seamlessly access both data coming form the physical environment via RFID tags, pervasive sensors and data coming form the Web, and we will be able to integrate them as needed in a suitable user-centric perspective. Starting from the earlier considerations, this chapter presents the design and implemen- tation of a system for tuple-based information access, context acquisition, and coordination in environments enriched with RFID tags [2]. The key idea is that our everyday environments will be more and more populated by RIFD tags, either attached to fixed location of the environment or to objects in it. These tags, while being low cost and battery-free, can make available some small amount of digital memory, in which it is possible to read and write data via wireless access. Thus, it is possible to collectively exploit such physically distributed memory areas as a sort of distributed shared memory: agents in an environment (whether they are humans carrying a mobile device or autonomous robots) can “access” such digital memory and, in this way, retrieve useful contextual information and=or coordinate with each other. The choice of adopting a tuple-based coordination model [3], providing distributed agents with associative content-based access to distributed memory areas (i.e., tuple spaces), suits well modern distributed computing scenarios. In fact, the suitability of tuple spaces abstractions to act both as general repositories of shared contextual information and as suitablemeans to support uncoupled coordination between agents is widely recognized. Still, while tuplebased coordination has already been extensively adopted for the coordination of distributed agents in distributed computational environments (e.g., high-performance computing [4] and Internet computing [5]), its exploitation in the context of emerging pervasive computing technologies and physical environments has started being explored only recently [6-8]. By bringing together the advantages of RFID technology and the power of tuple-based coordination models-and also thanks to its clean-layered implementation architecture and its simple API-our approach proves itself very fiexible, cheap to deploy, other than easy to use and suited for a variety of application scenarios. In addition, our approach clearly distinguishes from related work in the area: on the one hand, RFID technology has been exploited so far only for reading preexisting information on tagged objects and to exploit this information for logistics purposes [9] or to detect activities in an environment [10,11]; on the other hand, systems for pervasive tuple-based coordination proposed so far exploit costlier and more difficult to deploy technologies than RFID [8]. In any case, beside its advantages, we also emphasize that we are aware of a number of current limitations of our system, specifically in terms of reliability and security. These limitations do not generally undermine the usability of our approach (although in critical scenarios, they may limit its role to that of a complimentary support to more reliable and secure technologies), but nevertheless indicate the need for further work and extensions. The remainder of this chapter is organized as follow. Section 24.2 briefiy introduces RFID technology and discusses related work in the area. Section 24.3 presents the design and implementation of our system for RFID tuple spaces, the associated API and the current limitations of our system in terms of reliability, performances, and security. Section 24.4 introduces some application examples to clarify the use of our system and also discusses further potential application areas.

This paper capitalizes on this potential by proposing a swarm-intelligence inspired approach to map the boundary of offshore oil spills. A new probability map concept is developed, where an occupancy grid is probabilistically updated based on whether an UAV is recording the image of water, oil, or both. Sharing actionable information among UAVs in the form of occupancy grid updates can significantly reduce computing and communication overheads. The state of the probability map is used to control the exploitive and explorative components of the velocity vector that drives the waypoint planning decisions of each UAV. The flight of UAVs is divided into scouting, aggressive oil mapping, and boundary tracing phases. Various dispatch strategies and parameter settings are explored to identify suitable resource allocation for mapping efficiency. Simulated case studies are developed assuming quadrotor UAVs, with pertinent range and speed constraints. Resulting simulations showed that this method is able to map simple/complex and small/large oil spills with a greater than 95% success rate. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This presentation discusses the transition from military unique to global commercial design concepts, the adoption of performance and goal based philosophies by navies around the world, and some thoughts on where design and standards may be headed in the near future. Historically, the maturing of the industrial revolution in both Europe and America in the twentieth century facilitated the establishment of the modern industrial state. Western Society experienced an increased reliance on technology, and there was an emphasis on machines built purely for military application. This resulted in engineering specialties for warfare. With the rise of specialty sciences came the need for standardization to create consistent, quality equipment. Thus, military standards, suited only for military use, were developed. This trend, one of naval specialization, became the traditional approach to navy design and development for the next century. Some of its characteristics included design based on in-house standards (derived from extensive naval experience), prescriptive specification driven requirements, and self-regulation. The end of the Cold War brought with it the end of lavish military budgets. Globally, navies began looking for cost-efficient ways to maintain their industrial base and their military effectiveness. After many years of evolving separately, military ship designers and builders began once again to look to commercial builders, examining the methods they use to build commercial ships. Some initiatives included U.S. Acquisition Reform Initiatives (1992-2000), developing designs that are 'innovation friendly', the decision of several navies to leverage the commercial experience of classification societies (resulting in several rulesets addressing naval and defense ships), and the melding of commercial and military information technology - such as for unmanned and autonomous operations, and cybersecurity concepts. There has been a continuous incorporation of new and evolving technologies to design. As the world builds naval fleets that increasingly rely on technological advances, where will this lead and how will it all be incorporated into the design process? This paper examines the impact that a number of factors might have on the global naval fleet, including autonomous operations, larger fleets comprising smaller ships together with a reduced number of ship classes, the weaponizing of big data, and how global navies will both safeguard vessels from cyber threats and employ cyberwarfare. © 2017 The Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers.

A preceding paper introduced the Autonomy Exploitation and Realisation (ACER) programme and its architecture, outlining the development to date and setting out the overall programme objectives. This paper reports back on the work undertaken as part of Unmanned Warrior in October 2016, namely the rapid design, build, integration and fielding of 3 ACER command and control demonstration systems and their active employment at the centre of the largest unmanned systems demonstration of its type ever undertaken. Key technical features, including the use of open standards, the use of heterogeneous systems from different manufacturers, the deployment of systems at sea and ashore and the inclusion of an in service Combat Management System, are described, and the principal achievements and challenges are outlined. More detail is given on the operational feedback from RN operators and also the nature of the scenarios supported.

"The benefit of low cost accelerometers for GNSS anti-spoofing","2017","Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation Pacific Positioning, Navigation and Timing Meeting, Pacific PNT","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062966551&partnerID=40&md5=f9c9a4f89f15d596b5908fc7faebd595","Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are integral to aviation navigation and precise landings. It will be fundamental to many other safety of life applications such as railway and autonomous vehicles. To truly protect these systems and maintain safety, we need to not just address nominal hazards but also deliberate threats such as spoofing. Many methods have been proposed to address spoofing. A natural suggestion is to compare GNSS with other independent sensors, particularly inertial sensors. This paper develops a GNSS spoof monitoring methodology that uses comparisons with an inertial sensor. The methodology differs from prior methods developed and uses comparisons of accelerometers and GNSS acceleration (rather than position or velocity). This structure keeps the two instruments independent which makes it a steady state test and allows for tests over time. This paper develops and examines the use of acceleration from low cost sensors to detect GNSS spoofing in safety of life applications. We examine if there are suitably random accelerations and whether low inertial sensors can provide useful comparison to GNSS. Then we examine how we can use these measurements to provide robust spoof detection. First, we examine whether there are adequate signals from the vehicle and whether they are sufficiently measurable by both GNSS and low cost accelerometers. The conjecture is that it is difficult for malicious spoofer to predict and hence replicate the accelerations experienced by these vehicles. For example, an aircraft experiences random accelerations due to wind gusts as well as semi-random accelerations due to configurations changes (flap, landing gear position). Similarly, a railcar may experience potentially random accelerations along-track and in the vertical direction. Measurements from flight tests show that there are often significant and unique accelerations that can be measured by both GNSS and consumer grade accelerometer. In cryptographic terms, the acceleration information can provide a “one time pad” that is difficult for most spoofers to determine. To reasonably compare accelerations, the measurements from GNSS and the accelerometer need to be aligned. Accelerometers measure in the body frame while GNSS provides results in inertial or local frames. GNSS is used to estimate the body frame and align the two measurements. While the alignment is not exact, the results indicate that it may be generally sufficient for approach. Next, having an unpredictable and high frequency acceleration signature allows for the development of robust spoof detection monitoring. Guiding principles in the initial design are simplicity and low false alert rates. High false alert rate will cause high unavailability and, even worse, general distrust of the system. Hence, the paper develops a simple statistically based test for detection. It demonstrates the performance of the test method on the flight test data collected. © 2017 Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation Pacific Positioning, Navigation and Timing Meeting, Pacific PNT.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
"BOOMERANG: Exploiting the Semantic Gap in Trusted Execution Environments","2017","24th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, NDSS 2017","10.14722/ndss.2017.23227","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180411408&doi=10.14722%2fndss.2017.23227&partnerID=40&md5=18dbf5ba407f4b553967e0118e6dcde0","In the past decade, we have come to rely on computers for various safety and security-critical tasks, such as securing our homes, operating our vehicles, and controlling our finances. To facilitate these tasks, chip manufacturers have begun including trusted execution environments (TEEs) in their processors, which enable critical code (e.g., cryptographic functions) to run in an isolated hardware environment that is protected from the traditional operating system (OS) and its applications. While code in the untrusted environment (e.g., Android or Linux) is forbidden from accessing any memory or state within the TEE, the code running in the TEE, by design, has unrestricted access to the memory of the untrusted OS and its applications. However, due to the isolation between these two environments, the TEE has very limited visibility into the untrusted environment’s security mechanisms (e.g., kernel vs. application memory). In this paper, we introduce BOOMERANG, a class of vulnerabilities that arises due to this semantic separation between the TEE and the untrusted environment. These vulnerabilities permit untrusted user-level applications to read and write any memory location in the untrusted environment, including security-sensitive kernel memory, by leveraging the TEE’s privileged position to perform the operations on its behalf. BOOMERANG can be used to steal sensitive data from other applications, bypass security checks, or even gain full control of the untrusted OS. To quantify the extent of this vulnerability, we developed an automated framework for detecting BOOMERANG bugs within the TEEs of popular mobile phones. Using this framework, we were able to confirm the existence of BOOMERANG on four different TEE platforms, affecting hundreds of millions of devices on the market today. Moreover, we confirmed that, in at least two instances, BOOMERANG could be leveraged to completely compromise the untrusted OS (i.e., Android). While the implications of these vulnerabilities are severe, defenses can be quickly implemented by vendors, and we are currently in contact with the affected TEE vendors to deploy adequate fixes. To this end, we evaluated the two most promising defense proposals and their inherent trade-offs. This analysis led the proposal of a novel BOOMERANG defense, addressing the major shortcomings of the existing defenses with minimal performance overhead. Our findings have been reported to and verified by the corresponding vendors, who are currently in the process of creating security patches. © 2017 24th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, NDSS 2017.

One critical application domain for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) streaming is border security, mapping and precise agriculture. Regarding the first issue, the current political evolutions in the wide region of south eastern European territory reveals the significance for a wide surveillance. This is also valid in agriculture to get a more precise and high quality production. However, efficient access to video data located on Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) and real-time streaming is an arduous task due to large bandwidth requirements imposed by the video sequences and the unstable capacity and bandwidth of the wireless channel. In addition, the traditional representation of a video sequence as a stream of consecutive frames is not reliable for new emerging applications needed in aerial vehicles such as content indexing, retrieval and non-linear access and browsing. This reveals the need for the implementation of non-linear tools enabling the efficient summarization of the visual content. Summarization refers to the process of creating compact summaries of the Audio-Video (AV) content that facilitate discovery, browsing and navigation of the AV content. In this paper, we propose a fast video summarization algorithm that enables the extraction of key frames from UAV-captured videos. The algorithm exploits the curvature of the magnitude of visual feature trajectory to detect content fluctuations both in time and in space. Experiments on real-life aerial data reveal the efficiency of the proposed schemes. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

A key challenge to developing an acceptable sense and avoid system is the surveillance subsystem that must sense and track a variety of potentially threatening aircraft. Determining the required surveillance performance is not straightforward due to the complex interaction of surveillance performance with other system components to affect collision risk. This is typically accomplished using high-fidelity, fast-time, sample-based simulation that requires long development and analysis timelines, where the computational burden is high. This work provides an analytic approach to map surveillance performance to collision risk that mitigates these resource requirements in several cases. This approach is demonstrated when encountering noncooperative, or nontransponding, aircraft which is a key sense and avoid challenge because existing collision avoidance technology relies on cooperative surveillance. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, the analysis of provenance data is often left ""as an exercise for the reader"". The provenance community needs tools that allow users to quickly sort through large volumes of provenance data and identify records that require further investigation. By detecting anomalies in provenance data that deviate from established patterns, we hope to actively thwart security threats. In this paper, we discuss issues with current graph analysis techniques as applied to data provenance, particularly Frequent Subgraph Mining (FSM). Then we introduce Directed Acyclic Graph regular grammars (DAGr) as a model for provenance data and show how they can detect anomalies. These DAGr provide an expressive characterization of DAGs, and by using regular grammars as a formalism, we can apply results from formal language theory to learn the difference between ""good""and ""bad""provenance. We propose a restricted subclass of DAGr called deterministic Directed Acyclic Graph automata (dDAGa) that guarantees parsing in linear time. Finally, we propose a learning algorithm for dDAGa, inspired by Minimum Description Length for Grammar Induction [1]. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Understanding the aeroelastic system is of critical importance. Given the potentially destructive nature of flutter and its ability to rapidly manifest into a serious threat to the health of the vehicle, it must be included as a consideration in any test program. As such, a toolset is required that can perform modal identification in real-time. Identifying the modal properties (frequency, damping ratio, and mode shape) alone is not enough, the toolset must also include means to clearly and concisely present these results to the control room engineer. To complicate the problem further, the driving excitation is often unknown and the identification method must be capable of operating using output-only sensor data. To meet these challenges, a real-time identification method and toolkit was developed that operates in the frequency domain using output-only data. This identification technique was integrated into a more complete analysis framework that includes multiple methods for examining the identified modal properties: mode shape animations, and frequency and damping time history trends. Additionally, a demonstration of this complete toolset was performed using both simulated and flight test data collected from an experimental, aeroelastic unmanned aerial vehicle. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

We demonstrate the attack’s effectiveness using the Nymi Band, a wrist band that uses electrocardiography (ECG) as a biometric to authenticate the wearer. We instantiate the attack using a hardware-based Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG), an AWG software using a computer sound card, and the playback of ECG signals encoded as .wav files using an off-the-shelf audio player. In two sets of experiments we collect data from a total of 41 participants using a variety of ECG monitors, including a medical monitor, a smartphone-based mobile monitor and the Nymi Band itself. We use the first dataset to understand the statistical differences in biometric features that arise from using different measurement devices and modes. Such differences are addressed through the automated derivation of so-called mapping functions, whose purpose is to transform ECG signals from any device in order to resemble the morphology of the signals recorded with the Nymi Band. As part of our second dataset, we enroll users into the Nymi Band and test whether data from any of our sources can be used for a signal injection attack. Using data collected directly on the Nymi Band we achieve a success rate of 81%. When only using data gathered on other devices, this rate decreases to 43% when using raw data, and 62% after applying the mapping function. While we demonstrate the attack on the Nymi Band, we expect other ECG-based authentication systems to most likely suffer from the same, fundamental weaknesses. © 2017 24th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, NDSS 2017.

The consequence has been the replacement of clinical paternalism with bureaucratic and political paternalism, which compromises the autonomy of both clinicians and patients. Power relationships in the consultation can be broadly divided into three groups: clinician centred, patient centred (informed decision-making), and patient centred (shared decision-making). With the most recent generation of clinicians training in a culture of consent forms and defensive medicine, promoted by the threat of rising medical litigation, care is needed to ensure that decision-making responsibility is not excessively deferred to patients. The development of the trusting clinician-patient relationship required for patients to enact relational autonomy may take time, and continuity of care is therefore an important potential enabler.

Over the previous decades, space agency efforts have brought forth well-known and immensely useful satellites such as the Landsat series and the Gravity Research and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system, with costs typically of the order of 1 billion dollars per satellite and with concept-to-launch timelines of the order of 2 decades (for new missions). More recently, the proliferation of smartphones has helped to miniaturize sensors and energy requirements, facilitating advances in the use of CubeSats that can be launched by the dozens, while providing ultra-high (3-5 m) resolution sensing of the Earth on a daily basis. Start-up companies that did not exist a decade ago now operate more satellites in orbit than any space agency, and at costs that are a mere fraction of traditional satellite missions. With these advances come new space-borne measurements, such as real-time high-definition video for tracking air pollution, storm-cell development, flood propagation, precipitation monitoring, or even for constructing digital surfaces using structure-from-motion techniques. Closer to the surface, measurements from small unmanned drones and tethered balloons have mapped snow depths, floods, and estimated evaporation at sub-metre resolutions, pushing back on spatio-temporal constraints and delivering new process insights. At ground level, precipitation has been measured using signal attenuation between antennae mounted on cell phone towers, while the proliferation of mobile devices has enabled citizen scientists to catalogue photos of environmental conditions, estimate daily average temperatures from battery state, and sense other hydrologically important variables such as channel depths using commercially available wireless devices. Global internet access is being pursued via high-altitude balloons, solar planes, and hundreds of planned satellite launches, providing a means to exploit the “internet of things” as an entirely new measurement domain. Such global access will enable real-time collection of data from billions of smartphones or from remote research platforms. This future will produce petabytes of data that can only be accessed via cloud storage and will require new analytical approaches to interpret. The extent to which today's hydrologic models can usefully ingest such massive data volumes is unclear. Nor is it clear whether this deluge of data will be usefully exploited, either because the measurements are superfluous, inconsistent, not accurate enough, or simply because we lack the capacity to process and analyse them. What is apparent is that the tools and techniques afforded by this array of novel and game-changing sensing platforms present our community with a unique opportunity to develop new insights that advance fundamental aspects of the hydrological sciences. To accomplish this will require more than just an application of the technology: in some cases, it will demand a radical rethink on how we utilize and exploit these new observing systems. © 2017 Copernicus Publications.

As collisions are inevitable in over-constrained situations, we focus on deciding the liability for a hazard. Our insight is that hazards caused by malfunctions of autonomous vehicles result from loss of functional integrity. Design defects may leave it unnoticed, or the real-world may make integrity- preserving motion infeasible. Guarantee of functional integrity in an observable way at run-time is indispensable for revealing defects by using formal root-cause analysis, and for supporting safety claims by dismissing unreasonable doubts about design defects. From a practitical standpoint, we attempt to formalize a verification problem that consists of a novel criterion for determining liability for hazard, a safety claim comprised of confirmed observable states, and assumptions underlying the safety claim. We propose a run-time scheme of monitoring events that may lead to violations of the assumptions and a precursor to root-causes leading to loss of functional integrity and consequent hazards. We formulate a means of preemptively detecting unsafe motions liable to be hazardous as satisfiability problem within the framework of an adversarial motion planning subject to assumptions on maneuverability of movers. A numerical study shows that the run-time scheme using non-linear programming (NLP) encoding is viable in a real-world setting. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Explicitly coordinating resolution strategies for small UAS would require additional components such as a reliable vehicle-to-vehicle communication infrastructure and standardized protocols for information exchange that could significantly increase the cost of deploying small UAS in a shared airspace. This paper explores a novel approach that enables multiple aircraft to implicitly coordinate their resolution maneuvers. By requiring all aircraft to execute the proposed approach deterministically, it is possible for all of them to implicitly agree on the region of airspace each will be occupying in a given time interval. The proposed approach lends itself to the construction of a suitable feedback mechanism that enables the real-time execution of an implicitly conflict-free path in a closed-loop manner dealing with uncertainties in aircraft speed. If a network infrastructure is available, the proposed approach can also exploit the benefits of explicit information. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Among various types of GNSS attacks, we focus on the most powerful form of stealthy GNSS spoofing, based on the sequence of Receive, Modification, and Transmission (RMT) of GNSS messages. When precisely implemented, a RMT based spoofing attack can alter both the timing and content of GNSS messages at will, which can be very difficult for an unprepared regular receiver to detect and reject the bogus messages carried on the L1 channel. To address this open problem, in this work we explore high level software techniques to detect GNSS spoofing based on consistency checking among the timing and content of GNSS messages. We show that one can tailor the RAIM (Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring) model to detect timing inconsistency provided that at least one authentic GNSS channel is intact. Next, we analyze the SBAS message broadcast system and estimate the challenge in SBAS spoofing. It is clear that it is significantly harder to spoof the timing alone of SBAS channels due to the dynamic content broadcast. Simulation and experiments on the TEXBAT spoofing dataset were conducted to validate the proposed spoofing detection method. © 2017 Institute of Navigation.

It represents an enlarged version of the Askote Wildlife Sanctuary, encompassing the peripheral villages and landscape, which are part of the adjoining Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve. Of a total land area of about 4463 km2, only about 103 km2 or just 2.31% of the area is cultivated land. The present study however, confines itself to the summer habitations of the Bhotiya community residing within the valleys-Darma, Vyas and Johaar, and delves into the factors that sustain the very livelihood of the stakeholders. Trade with Tibet and the factors associated with its maintenance (agriculture and livestock) were the prime occupation of Joharis and Darmis tribesman until 1962, when the Sino-Indian war brought an immediate end to this thriving lifeline. The loss of trade brought about drastic changes in the transhumant lifestyle-fewer households arriving at their summer homes, a smaller livestock population, near disappearance of traditional handicrafts, and increased exploitation of wild medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs), with traditional crops being replaced by more remunerative crops such as chives (Allium stracheyi) and caraway (Carum carvi) as the chief source of livelihood, as in the case of Johaar valley. During the last decade and half, Yartsa Gunbu (caterpillar mushroom) has saliently brought about a change in not just the socio-economy of the landscape, but also in dilution of the socio-cultural norms defining their lifestyle. The present study discusses the causal factors behind changes in the lifestyles of these traditional people, inclusive of the causal factors behind the decline in transhumance, of traditional crop diversity, finally the salient aspects of Yartsa Gunbu exploitation, and concludes with proposals for possible alternatives for a sustainable future for these people. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"
"Intelligent lighting improves driving safety and comfort: Electronics and networking pave the way for new use cases","2017","VDI Berichte","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106007259&partnerID=40&md5=652d5a7fb2228b66c1fa51565eda31d3","Vehicle lighting has come a long way since the days of “electrics only” when filament headlamps just offered a choice between parking light, low beam and high beam. In retrospect, the biggest single change was the introduction of LED technology to the front lights. By using and controlling an LED matrix, the light distribution can be given multiple shapes and lengths, which improve lighting under varying traffic or weather conditions. Initially LED lighting was understandably often employed to facilitate new visual light designs mostly (“light signatures”) which help to differentiate between brands and to communicate emotional qualities. However, as LEDs always require an electronic control, the shift to LED technology has paved the ground for a much more profound change that has begun to happen: Once there is a light control unit (LCU), its electronics offer completely new functional possibilities. The key to exploiting these new possibilities lies in networking the LCU with other vehicle systems and with the data that is processed by them. Considering that advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and highly automated driving (HAD) are based on an increasingly large (sensor) data pool in the vehicle and in the backend, there is great potential in connecting lighting to this growing data pool. New information and more precise information about the vehicle environment can thus be used to improve the level of support which lighting can offer to the driver - or the automation. Continental is using its decade of expertise with developing and manufacturing LCUs to advance lighting to intelligent lighting by giving lighting a similar quality like ADAS. Via expanding the list of potential inputs for lighting control, new use cases become feasible and the driver will get better and more situation-appropriate support. The ultimate goal is to increase the performance of vehicle lighting so that the driver no longer needs to make manual adjustments. Instead of using hard thresholds to activate limited fixed options, intelligent lighting facilitates a new level of performance, which can include predictive lighting. Among the new intelligent lighting functions portrayed below are glare-free lighting, homogeneous lighting, high-definition lighting, and lighting tuned to the needs of HAD. © VDI Verlag GmbH · Düsseldorf 2017.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The Buddhist critique of these latter attitudes goes beyond prudential considerations of the bad effects of anger. Getting to the roots of anger means getting to the metaphysical picture of distinct individuals that is necessary for resentment of injustice to arise. This essay argues that dependent arising moves the criterion of correctness in individuation from correspondence with reality to efficacy in eliminating suffering. This shift carries with it a shift in attributions of agency and patient, of perpetrator and victim. Such attributions are correct when so ascribing agency facilitates the elimination of suffering.

However, it is unlikely that robots will arrive at planetary bodies without scientists having formed one or more hypotheses explaining data collected by precursor operations such as satellite images. These exploring robots collect observations to falsify the proposed hypotheses, incorporating those hypotheses can increase the efficiency of observation collection. This paper presents a novel algorithm, formulated in an exploration/exploitation framework, that directs robots to collect samples to determine which of a collection of hypotheses best explain data observed in situ by robots. We simulate a geologic exploration mission with a lander vehicle that can hop between locations of interest. This application is analogous to exploring of, e.g., the Aitken Basin of the south pole of Earth's Moon where sampling sites need to be separated hundreds or thousands of meters. We demonstrate that sampling algorithms aware of the hypotheses under investigation perform statistically significantly better than standard approaches, making more effective use of mission resources. © 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

"Assembly and operations for a cislunar orbit space station","2017","Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051369317&partnerID=40&md5=5f1b6deaa84c40919a747a22be7f39b2","Challenging space exploration missions are envisaged in the next future, involving a cooperation of humans and robots to accomplish ambitious goals beyond Low-Earth orbit. During the ideation of these forthcoming space programmes, international scientific community is focusing its attention on the sustainability of the entire long-term program, carefully sizing the intermediate steps and meticulously identifying new technologies needed to carry out the proposed activities. In particular, a gradual construction of a space station in cislunar environment is seen as a key element of the entire project and it opens an interesting field of multidisciplinary studies from a space system engineering perspective. The paper is founded on recent works focused on analysing the dynamics and controllability of large and flexible space structures in non-Keplerian orbits. The developed coupled orbit-attitude semi-analytical models, based on a Three-Body Problem modelling approach, are here first exploited to assess innovative and sustainable strategies to assemble the space station in the vicinity of the Moon. In fact, this future large space infrastructure will be credibly set up in-orbit by means of many rendezvous and docking automated activities, which should be carefully and progressively designed to reduce complexity, costs, and ensure reliability and repeatability. Therefore, the paper discusses the emerged potential assembly strategies with respect to selected criteria (e.g. inertia properties to minimize control action, attitude stabilisation techniques and rendezvous trajectories to simplify infrastructure construction). Then, possible rendezvous operations are presented for the proposed assembly baselines. The minimization of active control actions is foreseen: the full space of solutions is studied to highlight possible stable conditions that may be exploited to host and operate the cislunar station with minimum control effort. Analyses are presented according to the non-Keplerian orbits classes evaluated as the most suitable for a large infrastructure location: Halo, NRO and DRO. Rendezvous and docking in non-Keplerian environment have never been tested in real applications and the literature is somehow missing an extensive research on this topic, especially when orbit and attitude dynamics are considered together. Finally, particular operations for the space station in spin stabilised dynamics are examined as artificial gravity generator, which may be very favourable for prolonged astronaut permanence in space.

Stalls will be more frequently encountered by unmanned aircraft systems since most of them fly at air speeds comparable to prevailing wind and gusts in the atmospheric boundary layer. However, it is very difficult to get an accurate prediction on when stall/spin will occur for unmanned aircraft because lift estimates or angle of attack measurements may not be available. This paper provides a thorough flight test investigation of stall/spin detection techniques for a flying-wing UAS. Different types of stall data were collected through flight tests using a low-cost UAS platform, including flat stall, spin stall, vertical stall, etc. Several representative stall detection algorithms are used on the collected data including critical angle of attack estimation method, roll and yaw divergence methods. A new stall detection algorithm is proposed based on inertial angle of attack estimated without using flow angle sensors. Further analysis of collected stall data showed the effectiveness of the proposed methods for stall/spin detection and warning. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Exfiltration and/or modification of data is also a risk for space systems. Although the attack surface to space systems (supply chain, ground systems, networks, user terminals) is usually well protected, there is a high motivation for adversaries to seek out potential vulnerabilities on the spacecraft. Spacecraft architectures are typically based on heritage subsystems of hardware/software/firmware including real-time operating systems, embedded processors, shared bus architectures, and custom ASICs. These systems are highly redundant and resilient to component failures, since operation in the space environment of 15+ years is typical. However, spacecraft architectures were typically not designed with the cyber threat in mind. Well known cyber threat concepts (malware, privilege elevation, root-kits, system pivots, stack overflow, man-in-the-middle, reconnaissance) should now be considered when designing cyber defense for the spacecraft. A unique challenge for spacecraft cyber defense is the potential for denial-of-service attacks through the “safe mode” of the spacecraft. A cyber resilient spacecraft that is under attack will continue mission critical activities, initiate defensive measures, and “operate through” the attack without a trigger to a non-operational “safe mode” state. The Aerospace Corporation and Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute (SEI) are researching new approaches to spacecraft flight software for cyber resilient operations. This research includes: cyber threats relevant to the space environment, strengths and potential vulnerabilities for typical flight code processing, runtime assurance, analytics & detection, autonomous defense, and cyber assurance in the software lifecycle.

The opportunities are endless. Creating meaningful situations out of mobile arrays can transform the interaction with local spaces, opening up new avenues in the arts, design, and business.

In order to solve these positioning challenges, multiple navigation technologies have to be fused. These technologies are typically based on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), radar, camera, inertial sensors and signals of opportunity. Indeed, the exploitation of cellular communications for positioning is of special interest due to the advanced physical features of fourth generation (4G) and fifth generation (5G) mobile networks. The objective of this work is to assess the nominal performance of hybrid GNSS and 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) solutions, based on assisted or opportunistic approaches. For this purpose, a software tool is presented to evaluate different hybrid scenarios, by using field GNSS and simulated LTE observables. The assisted LTE approach is shown to outperform the opportunistic approach, by avoiding network inaccuracies. The proposed hybrid solutions achieve full position availability with a position accuracy around 10 meters at the 95% of the cases in urban and road scenarios.

While traditionally such systems were employed to support humans in tasks that required mere number-crunching, there is an increasing demand for systems that exhibit autonomous, intelligent behavior in complex environments. These complex environments often confront artificial systems with ill-posed problems that have to be solved under constraints of incomplete knowledge and limited resources. Tasks of this kind are typically solved with ease by biological computing systems, as these cannot afford the luxury to dismiss any problem that happens to cross their path as “ill-posed.” Consequently, biological systems have evolved algorithms to approximately solve such problems - algorithms that are adapted to their limited resources and that just yield “good enough” solutions quickly. Algorithms from biological systems may, therefore, serve as an inspiration for artificial information processing systems to solve similar problems under tight constraints of computational power, data availability, and time. One naive way to use this inspiration is to copy and incorporate as much detail as possible from the biological into the artificial system, in the hope to also copy the emergent information processing. However, already small errors in copying the parameters of a system may compromise success. Therefore, it may be useful to derive inspiration also in a more abstract way, that is directly linked to the information processing carried out by a biological system. But how can can we gain insight into this information processing without caring for its biological implementation? The formal language to quantitatively describe and dissect information processing - in any system - is provided by information theory. For our particular question we can exploit the fact that information theory does not care about the nature of variables that enter the computation or information processing. Thus, it is in principle possible to treat all relevant aspects of biological computation, and of biologically inspired computing systems, in one natural framework. In Wibral et al. (2015) we systematically presented how to analyze biological computing systems, especially neural systems, using methods from information theory and discussed how these information-theoretic results can inspire the design of artificial computing systems. Specifically, we focused on three types of approaches to characterizing the information processing undertaken in such systems and on what this tells us about the algorithms they implement. © Cambridge University Press 2017.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

More and more UAS platforms are considering integration of GNSS anti-jam (AJ) electronics and controlled radiation pattern antenna (CRPA) arrays to mitigate threats and ensure mission success. Due to restrictions and excessive costs for live-sky range testing, evaluation of these AJ systems requires specialized lab equipment and software to replicate the threats in dynamic environments. A test capability has been developed and validated, providing the test community with a cost-effective approach for evaluating AJ systems [1]. The test capability, referred to as the wavefront integrated threat simulator (WITS), utilizes a core architecture with mechanical tap-delay lines [2] and flexible personal computer interface options. Its expandability provides a range of simulated radio frequency (RF) antenna-element channels and capabilities with variable cost. The chief contribution of this paper lies in its calibration procedure which has been developed to minimize the aggregate angle of arrival (AoA) error for the GPS L1 frequency and the analytical analysis of the AoA error region. The WITS can be configured for a simple test configuration using a 4-channel system for $11,000 and may be expanded up to an N-channel configuration with high fidelity signal representation (i.e., Doppler, macro RF-path simulation with micro per-element calibrated delay ranges). The WITS validation includes per-channel calibration tables, per-channel theoretical phase contribution to angle-of-arrival (AoA) versus time, system level AoA error region analysis, AoA Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) estimate validation, output power requirements (potentially >120 dB Jamming to Signal ratio), and overall system latency. The modular design allows for user selection of appropriate fidelity and ensures a successful integration and evaluation of a GPS AJ system on multiple platforms and HWIL environments. © 2017 Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation Pacific Positioning, Navigation and Timing Meeting, Pacific PNT.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

These vehicles glide through the water column in a vertical saw-tooth trajectory by alternating their net buoyancy. It is important to achieve high Lift to Drag if long range and endurance are sought. However, such gliders are likely to have significant areas of laminar flow over their hull. This may be critical when predicting the performance of the full-scale glider from the results of physical model-scale testing. In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and model-scale testing was used for predicting the Lift to Drag ratio and assessing the static stability of a blended wing-body glider in pitch and yaw. Both fully turbulent and transitional flows were studied. The glider was simulated for a range of Angle-of-Attack at Reynolds numbers ranging from 1.0 x 105 – 2.4 x 106, based on the length of the glider. As the Reynolds number was increased there was a significant increase in Lift to Drag ratio and improved pitch stability. The glider was unconditionally stable in yaw for all cases modelled. Reynolds number and physical scale therefore has a significant effect on the performance of underwater gliders. This implies that the performance of the full-scale glider cannot be simply correlated with model-scale results, but requires model testing or numerical prediction at full-scale Reynolds numbers. © 2017 Royal Institution of Naval Architects.

As a consequence, the mission flight hours of UAS over the previous decade have grown significantly. With the predominance of this technology, there is a corresponding need to address potential threats against UAS. One such threat is a degradation or denial of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals, which have a significant role in the complex navigation solutions used by UAS. The Navigation Function within the Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) has partnered with the Army’s Project Office for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (PM UAS) to test, evaluate, and mitigate the effects of these navigation threats on Army UAS platforms. The Army has developed a five-year road map to address these threats with two complementary and parallel approaches. The first approach uses new and emerging technologies to increase the robustness of the GPS-based navigation solution in the presence of threats.

Wind tunnel experiments were conducted for two angles of attack. Velocity fields behind retreating and advancing blades were measured using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The vortex center and the core boundary were accurately identified by the method based on the normalized angular momentum. The major difference in an advancing blade as compared to a retreating one is in a stronger downwash behind the advancing propeller pushing the entire wake downward. Slopes of vortex center lines for the advancing blade are about two times steeper than in the retreating one. Peaks of velocity components are located right behind the propeller plane. On the advancing blade side, the vertical velocity component is approximately two times greater than on the retreating blade side. An increase in the vortex core size with the distance traveled is observed. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

"Highly automated driving in the predicament between technical possibilities, public expectations and safety & security requirements","2017","VDI Berichte","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105978166&partnerID=40&md5=451d735857318a094bde62021722ee89","The lecture starts with the initial situation in assisted and automated driving including a short definition of several levels of automation, a description of technical features within this levels and time of introduction on the market. Afterwards public expectations shall be discussed taking into account several stakeholders. Politics and society expect an increase of road traffic safety on the one hand. On the other hand, customers implicate benefit, e.g. increase of comfort, as well as harm, e.g. loss of control or vulnerability by cyber-attacks. In this context it is necessary to touch upon some legal issues, too. Safety and security requirements for highly automated driving including system verification and validation are currently being developed. In a first step, they can be derived from existing regulations and standards, e.g. UNECE regulation or ISO 26262, and from approval procedures for existing vehicle systems, e.g. passive safety systems. But there are some important limitations in this way. On the one hand we have to deal with technical limitations of sensors and algorithms regarding environment recognition and situation awareness in system safety design (keyword: functional deficiencies). On the other hand, we have to approve a huge number of environmental conditions, traffic situations and driver behaviour. It is not possible to cover this variability only by real testing as it is recently done. So virtual testing will play an important role in frame of the approval of systems for highly automated driving. The lecture gives an overview about recent activities in this field and closes with an outlook to further development of safety and security requirements as well as verification and validation procedures for highly and fully automated driving. © VDI Verlag GmbH, Düsseldorf 2017.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Especially for small UAVs, the complex low altitude environment may impose great threat to its safety operation. In this paper, we proposed an autonomous UAV collision avoid method based on stereo vision which is valid for low altitude scenario. Initially, the scenarios is classified into the in-the-air scenario and near- the-ground scenario based on a horizon detector. Then different obstacle detection and avoidance maneuver methods are adopted. For the near-the-ground scenario, a 3D reconstruction based detection method and a virtual obstacle plane based collision avoid method are adopted to sense and avoid the static obstacles on the ground. For the in-the-air scenario, small target detection and triangulation are used to localize the flying intruders and a collision cone based avoidance method are adopted. In the end, the stereo vision based SAA system are descirbed and hardware-in-the-loop test are carried out to validate the proposed collision avoid framework. The results shows that stereo vision can be an efficient way to assist the sense and avoid function for small UAVs’ operation. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This paper addresses the issue of physical-layer security in a UAV communication system, where a UAV sends confidential information to a legitimate receiver in the presence of a potential eavesdropper which are both on the ground. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate of the system by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and transmit power over a finite horizon. In contrast to the existing literature on wireless security with static nodes, we exploit the mobility of the UAV in this paper to enhance the secrecy rate via a new trajectory design. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve the problem efficiently, based on the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization methods. Specifically, the UAV's transmit power and trajectory are each optimized with the other fixed in an alternating manner until convergence. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the secrecy rate of the UAV communication system, as compared to benchmark schemes without transmit power control or trajectory optimization. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The devices in the overlay network are required to provide coverage to the underlay devices as well as to remain connected to other overlay devices. The coordination, planning, and design of such two-layer heterogeneous networks is an important problem to address. Moreover, the mobility of the nodes and their vulnerability to adversaries pose new challenges to the connectivity. For instance, the connectivity of devices can be affected by changes in the network, e.g., the mobility of the underlay devices or the unavailability of overlay devices due to failure or adversarial attacks. To this end, this work proposes a feedback based adaptive, self-configurable, and resilient framework for the overlay network that cognitively adapts to the changes in the network to provide reliable connectivity between spatially dispersed smart devices. Our results show that if sufficient overlay devices are available, the framework leads to a connected configuration that ensures a high coverage of the mobile underlay network. Moreover, the framework can actively reconfigure itself in the event of varying levels of device failure. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Almost all curb-to-curb paratransit services have a significantly large pickup time window, ranging from 20 to 40 min from the scheduled time and producing substantial passenger waiting times. The arrival notification system presented in this study delivers an automated voice call to a registered user once the paratransit vehicle is in proximity to the pickup location. The system utilizes the Google Traffic application programming interface (API) for the vehicle arrival estimation. Unlike other vehicle arrival notification systems in the state of the practice, the proposed system is compact and does not require additional equipment such as radio transmitting and positioning devices. The proposed system, which uses consumer mobile devices with the Android or iOS platform, is designed to exploit commercial cellular network service (i.e., 3G and 4G-LTE). In addition to the passenger notification, the proposed system provides paratransit drivers with real-time route guidance information developed through the Google Maps API. Field evaluation conducted in Essex County, New Jersey, revealed significant reduction in passenger waiting time. The passenger waiting time was reduced by 15 to 20 min. In addition, the accuracy of the notification system was tested. During the test, in almost all cases, the vehicle arrived 1 min earlier than the proposed arrival time. © 2017, SAGE Publications Ltd.

We propose new exploration strategies to generate paths for a drone to reach its destination while learning about the energy consumption on each edge on its path so as to optimize its range in future missions. As the energy consumption mostly depends on the payload, the wind direction, and the wind speed, we developed an energy model to estimate the energy consumption based on these factors. We evaluated our exploration strategies for learning the energy model in order to identify the set of all reachable destinations. We found that adding a small amount of perturbation to encourage exploration can increase the learning rate. © Copyright 2017, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

The exploration of the seafloor for the exploitation of natural resources is increasing the global concerns for the potential detrimental consequences and there is an urgent need of developing eco-sustainable tools and approaches for better environmental monitoring. New monitoring protocols and technologies are becoming available for the assessment of the status and, eventually, habitat restoration of degraded habitats. In order to cope with the large heterogeneity of seafloor ecosystems, the current marine monitoring needs to be enforced either in temporal and spatial scales. According to the ecosystem-based approach and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), organisms and ecosystems should be at the centre of marine management strategies, which requires the achievement of a good environmental status either in coastal and deep-sea ecosystems. The new spatial-Temporal monitoring strategy should be based on the best available technologies including mobile platforms, autonomous vehicles, and animal-mediated data acquirement, enabling an adaptive and extensive monitoring of marine ecosystems. Established protocols for the biologically-based monitoring should be based on the availability of essential environmental and ecological variables able to identify criteria for the sustainable exploitation of vulnerable marine ecosystems. Here we present an analysis of the essential variables that will allow the implementation of the Marine Strategy for the development of a new eco-sustainable blue-based economy able also to identify the criteria to assess the restoration/recovery of degraded habitats. © 2018 SPE All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we motivate, design, and implement ViewMap, an automated public service system that enables sharing of private dashcam videos under anonymity. ViewMap takes a profile-based approach where each video is represented in a compact form called a view profile (VP), and the anonymized VPs are treated as entities for search, verification, and reward instead of their owners. ViewMap exploits the line-of-sight (LOS) properties of dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) such that each vehicle makes VP links with nearby ones that share the same sight while driving. ViewMap uses such LOS-based VP links to build a map of visibility around a given incident, and identifies VPs whose videos are worth reviewing. Original videos are never transmitted unless they are verified to be taken near the incident and anonymously solicited. ViewMap offers untraceable rewards for the provision of videos whose owners remain anonymous. We demonstrate the feasibility of ViewMap via field experiments on real roads using our DSRC testbeds and trace-driven simulations.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

More intelligent mobility and ultimately autonomous transport assets will deliver these efficiencies through the evolution of cooperative intelligent transport system (C-ITS) technology. Central to this evolution will be the capability to accurately and precisely position assets within their environment and relative to each other to predefined and regulated standards. The core of modern positioning and navigation methods are the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) (e.g. GPS, Galileo, GLONASS and BeiDou). These systems rely on line of sight radio frequency signals, which are vulnerable to obstruction and/or interference (e.g. multipath and/or non-line of sight reception). As a result, the position accuracy is degraded and therefore GNSS would greatly benefit from a priori intelligence that predicts where and when obscuration or interference will occur. Similarly, a real time assessment of where and when GNSS signal reception will be restored and the location of the satellites in the sky will aid in restoring satellite lock. This paper describes a computer vision system that utilises 360o images to derive a priori intelligence to predict changes in the environment that may threaten position and navigation integrity. © 2017, Institute of Navigation.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

It notes a difficulty in defining the epidemiology of the above condition because the data are primarily based upon mass media news coverage. The incidence of sudden cardiac death is approximately 1 per 100,000 young athletes; more than 90% boys die. The sports, during which sudden cardiac death often occurs, include (both American and European) football, basketball, and hockey. Sudden cardiac death due to commotio cordis (life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias resulting from a blow with a blunt instrument to the area of the heart during the vulnerable phase of the cardiac cycle) is considered separately. Children who die suddenly during sports are frequently detected to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or myocarditis; but no changes are found in more than 50% of cases at autopsy, which is suggestive of primary arrhythmogenic death. The basis for prevention is the early detection of diseases that can cause sudden death during sports, regular examination, knowledge of ECG characteristics in athletes, and first aid techniques, including the use of automated external defibrillators. © 2017 Ediciones Mayo S.A.

Smart, eventually self-driving, vehicles are expected to form an important segment of the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled word, introducing new modes of transportation and new types of services. This merge of the ubiquitous smart systems with the smart vehicle environment is often referred to as co-operative intelligent transportation system (C-ITS). Nevertheless, the above enhancements give rise to significant security and privacy concerns. Remote attacks have already been reported in production vehicles, even though their capabilities and features are very limited compared to future models. The significantly enlarged attack surface, the complexity of interactions, and the variety of threat actors necessitate the introduction of appropriate mechanisms, to ensure that the vehicular platforms and the associated applications are secure enough for users to rely upon. In this chapter, we summarize the threats, requirements, and challenges in securing vehicular networks, examining both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) interactions. Moreover, a holistic approach for intrusion detection, prevention, and mitigation for C-ITS ecosystems is presented, considering the said deployments as an important part of the cyber-physical systems that are essential to protect.

"Advanced GPS-based attitude estimation scheme for various IMU failure scenarios of low-cost UAV","2017","30th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS 2017","10.33012/2017.15224","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047861693&doi=10.33012%2f2017.15224&partnerID=40&md5=607dc774590dfeb596f54607bf6211e5","In this paper, we propose an advanced GPS-based attitude estimation method that can achieve high attitude estimation performance in response to various IMU failure scenarios of small and low-cost UAV. Since low-cost UAVs are sensitive to the cost of system construction, they have insufficient measures against IMU failures. Therefore, IMU failure can seriously degrade navigation performance and threaten system survival. The single-Antenna GPS-based attitude estimation method is useful as a backup navigation system against the IMU failure of the GPS / INS integrated navigation system by enabling the determination of the attitude by GPS alone without additional sensor. However, since this method determines the attitude based on the ground velocity from GPS receiver, when the wind is blown or maneuver of UAV is performed, the attitude error increases. In order to compensate for the disadvantages of single antenna GPS-based attitude, this paper combines the measurements of magnetometer and available IMU measurement of partial IMU failure. Construction of filter is proposed to estimate the error of single antenna GPS-based attitude using magnetic field vector measurements. It prevents the error of the single-Antenna GPS attitude from increasing due to the strong wind or the sudden maneuver. And it is also possible to improve the attitude estimation performance by using the available IMU measurement when a partial failure occurs in the IMU. The proposed method is verified through simulation and flight tests. The results show that the proposed method was able to estimate the attitude error through the magnetic field vector measurement, and the attitude estimation performance was improved. In the case of partial failure of the IMU, the accuracy of the attitude estimation was improved by using the available IMU measurements. © 2017 Institute of Navigation.

In this paper, we use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to deal with VANET jamming, especially smart jamming that changes the jamming policy based on the ongoing communication status of the VANET. More specifically, the UAV relays the data of OBUs to another roadside unit (RSU) with a better transmission condition if the serving RSU is located in a heavily jammed area. The interactions between the UAV and the jammer are formulated as an anti-jamming UAV relay game, in which the UAV decides whether or not to relay the data of the OBU to another RSU that is far away from the jammer, and the latter chooses the jamming power. The Nash equilibria (NE) of the game are derived to reveal how the best UAV relay strategy depends on the transmission cost and the radio channel model. A hotbooting policy hill climbing (PHC)-based UAV relay strategy is proposed to address jamming in the dynamic UAV-aided VANET game without the knowledge of network model and jamming model. Simulation results show that the proposed relay strategy can efficiently reduce the bit error rate (BER) of OBU data and thus increase the utility of VANET in comparison with a Q-learning based scheme. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The main issues which can lead to a misdiagnosis of AF include its episodic nature, disease diversity and noise. The aim of 2017 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge is to classify short single lead ECG recordings as normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, other rhythm, or noisy. We present a method using heart rate variability features and noise detection features coupled with template-based wave morphology features. The method originality lies in the use of special templates sensitive to the heart rate variability as well as wave morphology. These special templates showed significant results in AF detection performances. Based on Cross-validation, an F1 score of 0.84 on AF classification, and a general classification score of 0.76 were obtained on the training set. © 2017 IEEE Computer Society.

"Using wind shock-waves and turbulence as a soft attrition capability against a smart adversary team of UAVs","2017","Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080955282&partnerID=40&md5=7e8e6b3dfec096186a3fe0ee403879e9","In this paper we propose a new soft-attrition capability: using wind shock-waves and turbulence against a smart adversary team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within a confined space in an urban environment. A 3D UAV Simulator has been developed in Decision Sciences, JOAD, DST-Group, based on the theoretical foundation for controlling swarms of UAVs. A particular version of the simulator (used in this paper) was designed for indoor navigation of a team of UAVs with the objective to sustain their stable flight under wind turbulence conditions. The core of this indoor UAV simulator is a nonlinear, highly-robust, fuzzy-logic control based, smart individual collision-avoidance system for each UAV, which results in the flocking behavior of a whole team under threat. The simulator uses two types of sensors: radars-on-a-chip and sonars, 6 radars and 6 sonars per UAV, one radar and one sonar per side of the UAV’s bounding box. The collision avoidance system was designed by combining (via logical And) the speed and distance fuzzy-logic If-Then rules of the form: If an object is approaching from Front with high speed Then move Backward with high speed, And If an external object is very close in Front, Then move Backward with high speed, etc. To counteract this smart team of adversary UAVs, a new soft-attrition capability has been developed in the form of a wind shock-wave field (which develops into a tornado-type wind turbulence inside a confined space), defined by the Tanh-solution of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The wind shock-wave field represents a fast-traveling train of non-dissipating solitons (like a 1-dimensional train of neural impulses running down the neural fibre, or a 2-dimensional series of tsunamis caused by an underwater earthquake and fast-flowing along the ocean from one shore to the other). This non-dissipating wind wave depends on two parameters, amplitude and frequency, which can be changed at will. The qualitative analysis presented in this paper shows that even the smart team of bird-like UAVs with superb collision-avoidance system can be blown away by the wind shock-waves (with the amplitude that is many times higher than the thrust capabilities of the individual UAVs) and the tornado-like turbulence caused in the confined environment. © 2017 Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017.

Remote sensing has a fundamental role to play in the characterization of our Earth through mapping, monitoring, and modeling, often requiring the fusion of multiresolution ground-based, airborne, and satellite assets to support comprehensive analyses. Affecting policies, programs, and legislation, remote sensing analyses of societal benefits associated with our key national priorities are vital to assessing status and threats to their sustainability. Often, land cover/land use change is used as a proxy to strategically assess changes in societal benefits and the implications of people, policies, and management programs on realizing full and effective benefits to society. The topics and approaches that are described in the following chapters, part of a broader initiative, the Comprehensive Remote Sensing project edited by Shunlin Liang, suggest a rich and varied perspective and a diversity of themes to fully assess the human dimension and the associated societal benefits. Through in situ data collection approaches, secondary data from social surveys and censuses, use of terrestrial LIDAR, unmanned aerial vehicles, airborne systems, and space-based technologies, a host of national and international study sites are examined to highlight fundamental questions, challenges, and opportunities in the use of comprehensive remote sensing to address people, environment, and their interactions to assess societal benefits and their space-time scales and variabilities. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

For an example, the Internet of Things (IoT) will reportedly soon generate a staggering 400 zettabytes (ZB) of data a year. Self-driving cars are predicted to churn out 4000 GB of data per hour of driving. Big data analytics, as an emerging analytical technology, o?ers the capability to collect, store, process, and visualize these vast amounts of data. Big Data Analytics in Cybersecurity examines security challenges surrounding big data and provides actionable insights that can be used to improve the current practices of network operators and administrators. Applying big data analytics in cybersecurity is critical. By exploiting data from the networks and computers, analysts can discover useful network information from data. Decision makers can make more informative decisions by using this analysis, including what actions need to be performed, and improvement recommendations to policies, guidelines, procedures, tools, and other aspects of the network processes. Bringing together experts from academia, government laboratories, and industry, the book provides insight to both new and more experienced security professionals, as well as data analytics professionals who have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise. It covers a wide range of topics in cybersecurity, which include: • Network forensics • Threat analysis • Vulnerability assessment • Visualization • Cyber training. In addition, emerging security domains such as the IoT, cloud computing, fog computing, mobile computing, and cyber-social networks are examined. The book first focuses on how big data analytics can be used in different aspects of cybersecurity including network forensics, root-cause analysis, and security training. Next it discusses big data challenges and solutions in such emerging cybersecurity domains as fog computing, IoT, and mobile app security.

Because of their locating capabilities, which are quickly becoming one of the standard features in mobile devices, more and more people are getting used to the location-enabled life. MEMS accelerometers and gyros, for instance, can be employed for localization in combination with absolute positioning technologies, such as GNSS or other wireless technologies. Wireless technologies have also been under rapid development. Types of wireless technologies being developed range from simple IrDA that uses infrared light for short-range, point-to-point communications, to wireless personal area network (WPAN) for short range, point-to multi-point communications, such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, to mid-range, multi-hop wireless local area network (WLAN, a.k.a. Wireless Fidelity Wi-Fi), to long-distance cellular phone systems, such as GSM/GPRS and CDMA. Using these technologies navigation itself has become much broader than just providing a solution to LBS (Location Based Services) questions, such as “Where am I?” or “How to get from the start point to a destination?” It has moved into new areas such as games, geolocation, mobile mapping, virtual reality, tracking health monitoring and context awareness; all of which have been enabled by MEMS and wireless technology. Typically, the MEMS-based motion (or inertial) sensors are used for continuous trajectory determination of a mobile client via dead reckoning (DR). In GNSS denied environments where the satellite signal is either totally blocked or attenuated Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc., can serve as absolute positioning technology. The combination of the absolute positioning systems and the MEMS sensors exploits their complementary characteristics. These integrated navigation technologies and methods have become indispensable in many applications like car navigation, human motion modelling, first-responder personal navigation, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) navigation, and portable navigation. In this paper the MEMS sensor potential and application in combination with wireless options are discussed. Their applications range from determination of the distance travelled, heading, altitude, etc., of a mobile user. In combination with GNSS and/or other absolute positioning technology a good performance and positioning accuracies on the few meter level is achievable. The small size, low power and weight, and low cost of MEMS sensors have led to increased use, new applications, increased mobility, increased integration (hence better performance) and extended operation. Current and future developments are expected to lead to an even higher performance. In this paper an emphasis on applicability and performance for navigation of a mobile client is led. © 2017 Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation Pacific Positioning, Navigation and Timing Meeting, Pacific PNT.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) is examining options for the creation of a distributed network of longitudinally distributed, low cost commercial–off-the-shelf electro-optical sensors to support survey work and catalogue maintenance. To effectively exploit this, a robust data handling system is required to autonomously detect satellite trails in a manner that can handle variable target intensities, periodicities and rates of apparent motion, as well as meteors and aircraft. Data captured during the United Kingdom/New Zealand Automated Transfer Vehicle-5 (ATV-5) de-orbit observation trial have been employed to inform the development of a prototype processing pipeline for autonomous on-site processing. The approach taken employs pre-existing and documented tools such as Astrometry.NET and DAOPHOT from the astronomical community, together with image processing and orbit determination software developed in-house by Dstl.

Companies and space agencies from around the world are now trying to reach the Moon again, with the aim of establishing a permanent presence. Notable examples include ESA’s Moon Village proposal and the private teams competing in the Google Lunar X Prize. The O’Moon project aims to design deployable, modular and autonomous generators which will be used to rapidly build an electrical infrastructure on the Moon. This infrastructure will then be used to support future missions, both robotic and crewed, and provide one of the pillars for future inhabited lunar bases. O’Moon used as a basis the design for a mobile deployable generator developed by O’Sol, a French startup company, for use on Earth. This paper aims to analyse O’Sol’s design and transpose it from a terrestrial application to lunar application. This study included an analysis of the deployment system and its vulnerability to cold welding and lunar dust. This study also performed a thermal analysis of the generator and proposed a top-level design for a thermal control system able to ensure a thermal balance both during daytime and night-time. This included a discussion on the effects of thermal conduction through the lunar ground, and how this could be exploited by an active thermal control system. Finally, this paper discusses the expected lifetime of a generator as proposed by O’Moon on the lunar surface, and how this lifetime may be prolonged if the appropriate maintenance could be carried out either by robots or astronauts. Ultimately, this paper aims to assess the suitability of O’Sol’s generator and its deployment system as part of the O’Moon concept. It highlights some of the key differences between the designs of a solar generator for terrestrial and lunar applications. It also provides some recommendations regarding the mechanical and thermal design, including potential countermeasures for constraints such as lunar dust. This paper is part of the O’Moon Youth Research Program, which led a series of studies centered on some of the key aspects of the project and including engineering, business, legal and organisational aspects of the project.

Window performance in adverse weather conditions can be improved with the incorporation of thin film heaters, hydrophobic coatings, and surface treatments as well as transparent conductive layers to shield against electromagnetic interference. Linear variable filters reduced to the size of the imager, provide hyperspectral capability, grating order reduction for spectrometers and the capability of replacing the spectrometer completely. Fixed wavelength filters enable on-board cameras to survey a particular chemical species or contaminant. Examples of filter and window combinations are presented.

In this paper, we consider the setting where a predictor Bob has a fixed model, and an unknown attacker Alice aims to perturb (or poison) future test instances so as to alter Bob's prediction to her benefit. We focus specifically on Bob's optimal defense actions to limit Alice's effectiveness. We define a general framework for determining Bob's optimal defense action against Alice's worst-case attack. We then demonstrate our framework by considering linear predictors, where we provide tractable methods of determining the optimal defense action. Using these methods, we perform an empirical investigation of optimal defense actions for a particular class of linear models - autoregressive forecasters - and find that for ten real world futures markets, the optimal defense action reduces the Bob's loss by between 78 and 97%. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

In our previous work, we circumvented this problem for ATD in cargo containers, using Threat Image Projection and data augmentation. In this work, we investigate whether data scarcity for other modalities, such as parcels and baggage, can be ameliorated by transforming data from one domain so that it approximates the appearance of another. We present an ontology of ATD datasets to assess where transfer learning may be applied. We define frameworks for transfer at the training and testing stages, and compare the results for both methods against ATD where a common data source is used for training and testing. Our results show very poor transfer, which we attribute to the difficulty of accurately matching the blur and contrast characteristics of different scanners. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

It poses a great threat to human life and environment, and incurs higher cost of production than conventional drilling operations. To improve efficiency with increased production, offshore oil and gas industry introduced robotics technology in many underwater drilling and production operations. Implementation of robots also introduced complexity and added risks to the processes. The present study aims at identifying hazards and assessing risks associated with using underwater robots in offshore oil and gas production. Once potential scenarios caused by robotic failures are identified, consequences could be developed, and risk assessment could be done by traditional methods. The specific objectives of the current research are: to study robotics technologies used in offshore platforms primarily, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV); to understand their roles and limitations in oil and gas production; to study potential threats leading to underwater robot-robot collision or robot-structure collision; to evaluate all possible consequences due to collision; to recommend necessary safety barriers for identified threats.

Specifically, optimal feedfor- ward inputs are found such that with respect to the posterior distri- bution, the robot moves to minimize uncertainty. The formulation depends on the robot's dynamics model and the sensor's stochastic measurement model. Additionally, a utility function is defined such that the estimator's uncertainty is minimized, i.e., the acquisition of information is maximized. The approach is applied to a single robot with three different sensor models for validation.

Since deep learning techniques have shown great performance in object detection, we utilize “You only look once”(YOLO), which is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection framework for automatic vehicle detection.

Each single acquisition method has its advantages and disadvantages in detecting displacements. In dense point clouds of laser scans, distance changes in line of sight are easy to identify. In contrast, high-resolution image data is sensitive to displacements perpendicular to the viewing direction of the camera, where the analysis of scan data weakens. A promising solution of combining the advantages and reducing the drawbacks is the fusion of laser-scan and image data in the form of RGB+D images. Point clouds are converted into a depth image, resulting in an additional D-channel to the color (RGB) image data. In the combined RGB+D image, each pixel can be directly converted into 3D coordinates. The necessary mutual orientation of both data sets can be solved via a-priori sensor calibration or a-posteriori data registration. By identifying corresponding points in subsequent measurement epochs (RGB+D images), it is further possible to directly determine 3D displacement vectors. The results of the RGB+D method can be integrated in a rigorous geodetic deformation analysis with tests of significance. Corresponding points in the images can be found by identifying key points and by describing them with image features, for example. Prominent representatives of image features are the SIFT algorithm or the binary descriptor BRISK. These algorithms are used to match two images at an abstract numerical level, instead of in the original image domain. The combined analyzing strategy is described in detail with the help of an artificial experimental setup and is compared with conventional methods for the evaluation of laser scan data. It appears that the results of the presented approach can be interpreted more easily and clearly, and that it will avoid apparent deformations. Sensor data of any kind of acquisition system can be used, such as modern total stations, mobile mapping systems, unmanned aerial vehicles or robot platforms. It will exploit the full potential of sensor data of such systems, which already provide both kind of data, for the first time.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The Multi- Wavelength DIAL, an extension of the conventional DIAL technique, is one of the most powerful remote sensing methods for the identification of multiple substances and seems to be a promising solution compared to existing alternatives. In this paper, first in-field tests of a smart and fully automated Multi-Wavelength mini-DIAL will be presented and discussed in details. The recently developed system, based on a long-wavelength infrared (IR-C) CO2 laser source, has the potential of giving an early warning, whenever something strange is found in the atmosphere, followed by identification and simultaneous concentration measurements of many chemical species, ranging from the most important Greenhouse Gases (GHG) to other harmful Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Preliminary studies, regarding the fingerprint of the investigated substances, have been carried out by cross-referencing database of infrared (IR) spectra, obtained using in-cell measurements, and typical Mixing Ratios in the examined region, extrapolated from the literature. First experiments in atmosphere have been performed into a suburban and moderately-busy area of Rome.

With the majority of bridges passing half of their expected service life, a large amount of investment needs to be made to inspect and maintain them in a safe condition. Manual inspection methods are both time-consuming and costly, which may discourage further inspections and follow-up of defects. Thus, there is a great need for using an automated data collection system. Surface defects (e.g. cracks) in concrete bridges can be inspected using 3D Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanner as a Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) method. However, the commonly used terrestrial LiDAR is limited to stationary data collection, which reduces the accessibility to some components of the bridges. To tackle this limitation, a LiDAR attached to an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) provides more flexibility and accessibility for inspecting large surface areas without threatening inspectors' safety. After providing a comprehensive literature review about the usage of UAVs and LiDAR for the inspection of different types of structures, this paper proposes a high level framework for bridge inspection using LiDAR-equipped UAV. The framework includes the following steps: (1) planning a collisionfree optimized path with respect to the minimum cost and maximum coverage considering a variety of constrains and requirements related to the hardware and the inspection task, and (2) data analysis for detecting the surface defects based on the collected point clouds.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Presently, the HOV is in concept design phase. Current HOVs in service could only work below 7,000m. To increase the submergence depth from 7,000m to 11,000m for a FOD HOV, the time spending in descent and accent will take a majority part of power endurance and leave little time in scientific studies. Hence, the descent/ascent motion analysis and optimization will play a bigger role in FOD HOV designs contrasting to current HOVs. In this paper, in order to investigate resistance characteristics and drag coefficients in decent and ascent directions of the FOD HOV, the Reynolds Averaged Navier- Stokes (RANS) equations were solved using computational fluid dynamics.

The most important advantage of flapping wing air vehicles examined in this study, thrust force occurs as a result of flapping motion of the wings and thus an external thrust system is not required. The aim of this study, unsteady flow in flapping wings is to examine with experiments in wind tunnel. The scope of work a flapping wing mechanism was designed and the aerodynamics parameters at different wind speed, angle of attack and flapping frequencies were examined while the wings produced with different materials were flapping. According to the obtained results; while the lift force was increased at higher wind speed and angle attack, the thrust force was reduced because of friction. At high flapping frequency while the thrust force was increased, the lift force was decreased. Thrust force of airfoils made of nylon sheet and latex airfoils are better than those of wood airfoils is found.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It consists of a triple-layered processing scheme that supports segmenting the luggage contents based on the effective atomic number of each object, which is then followed by a dual-layered clustering procedure. The latter comprises of mild and a hard clustering phase. The former is based on a number of morphological operations obtained from the image-processing domain and aims at disjoining mild-connected objects and to filter noise.

Design/methodology/approach – The hybrid model of multi-scale Gaussian mutation (MGM) mechanism and pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) algorithm is established for image matching problem. The MGM mechanism is a nonlinear model, which can adjust the position of pigeons by mutation operation. In addition, the variable parameter (VP) mechanism is exploited to adjust the map and compass factor of the original PIO. Low-cost quadrotor, a type of electric multiple rotorcraft, is used as a carrier of binocular camera to obtain the images. Findings – This work improved the PIO algorithm by modifying the search strategy and adding some limits, so that it can have better performance when applied to the image matching problem. Experimental results show that the proposed method demonstrates satisfying performance in convergence speed, robustness and stability. Practical implications – The proposed MGMPIO algorithm can be easily applied to solve practical problems and accelerate convergence speed of the original PIO, and thus enhancing the speed of matching process, which will considerably increase the effectiveness of algorithm.

"Geo-fencing to secure airport perimeter against sUAS","2017","International Journal of Intelligent Unmanned Systems","10.1108/IJIUS-02-2017-0002","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034773425&doi=10.1108%2fIJIUS-02-2017-0002&partnerID=40&md5=145555e76c9900e0932d29827f4be5b8","Purpose: Small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) are becoming increasingly popular among hobbyists, and with this popularity there comes the risk of runway incursion between a commercial aircraft and sUAS around airports. To keep airports safe and secure, the purpose of this paper is to propose a module, called the Airport Secure Perimeter Control System, that can be attached to every hobbyist’s sUAS for the purpose of notification and prevention. Design/methodology/approach: Upon startup, the module connects to a database containing the central coordinates of every airport in the USA. A five-mile critical radius plus an additional one-mile buffer region is established around each point. The buffer region is created in order to inform the user that he/she is approaching a safe airspace and needs to take corrective action. Once the five-mile zone has been breached, autopilot software takes over the manual controls, and the sUAS is landed in a controlled manner, while the user still has lateral control of the vehicle in order to avoid any potential hazards below it. Then, both operator and airport receive messages about the event. Findings: To demonstrate the proposed design, a prototype was developed that successfully implemented this system, and was formally tested within a controlled environment. Originality/value: This solution would drastically reduce the security threat of sUAS breaching the critical regions surrounding airports, and its implementation is relatively simple. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"Labor insertion of people with disabilities in public employment. Legal-economic analysis of the situation in the Community of Madrid; [La inserción de las personas con discapacidad en el empleo público. Análisis jurídico-económico de la situación en la Comunidad de Madrid]","2017","CIRIEC-Espana Revista de Economia Publica, Social y Cooperativa","10.7203/CIRIEC-E.91.10738","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040647489&doi=10.7203%2fCIRIEC-E.91.10738&partnerID=40&md5=016da1210c5e21a406fe9a04c84625ec","Disabled people face difficulties when accessing the labour market and then require of public policies to protect them and specific mechanisms to favor their labour market integration. This article focuses on the analysis of the available tools to access public employment, their principles, characteristics (different from those relative to the private sector) and the problems they pose to disabled people. Employment is the main channel through which disabled people achieve not only personal autonomy, but also social inclusion. Several international reports - among which are paramount the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities approved by United Nations in 2006 and the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020-show the vulnerability of this group that suffers from poverty indexes above the average. This is mainly the consequence of their difficulties to find a job. Within the public policies framework, different mechanisms have been devised to foster the employability of disabled people. Nonetheless, such mechanisms differ between private and public sectors, with the latter being the motivation for this article. In Spain, the study of this issue consists on the following factors: a) Firstly, the competential factor, since the legislation is distributed between the Government and the Autonomous Communities. Thus, the latter have margin to implement their own policies on this matter, but complying with governmental principles. b) According to the Spanish Constitution, the accessing system to public employment is based on merit and ability, which gives way to rigid systems to access public employment (public examination, contest and public examination contest). Measures to boost public employment of disabled people must comply with those principles and systems taking into account potential limitations. c) The procedure to facilitate access of disabled people to public employment is the so called ""cupo de reserva"" (reserved quota), which consists of reserving a percentage of the offered vacancies. This mechanism has also been a source of judicial conflicts given its discriminatory nature, even though eventually endorsed by its characteristic as a positive action aimed to eliminate obstacles for this vulnerable group. d) Finally, it cannot be forgotten that public sector employment does not only affect territorial Administrations, but also the so called institutional public sector which consists on several organizations of different nature and legal status with civil servants or contract basis employees. Among these organizations, public firms must comply with the same rules as private companies and, more precisely, they must employ 2% of disabled people among their workers for companies of more than 50 workers. This article performs a data analysis that highlights that public firms do not comply with this rule to a larger extend than private companies. Within this framework, the work focuses its investigation in the Autonomous Community of Madrid because of two main reasons: 1) On the one hand, because this Autonomous Community has been largely implementing multiyear and multisector plans to tackle different issues that affect disabled people. A trip throughout these plans highlights the evolution of public policies regarding this issue and their limitations according to their assessment reports; 2) On the other hand, because of the importance of the Autonomous Community of Madrid in terms of population and economic activity, since Madrid has a great amount of disabled people in the position of obtaining a job. The relevance of this work is fourfold: a) Firstly, because it brings together the legislative and economic analyses, allowing not only to depict the departing point but to illustrate with data some of the weaknesses pointed out by the examination of the legal issues. b) Secondly, the lack of complete official databases throughout this investigation has required of great effort of data collection and elaboration. c) Thirdly, public policies entail public expenditures of which effectiveness and efficiency should be assessed. This is even more relevant when undertaking multiyear plans prolonged along time. Regarding this, the following Action Plan of the Autonomous Community of Madrid to be undertaken should improve certain elements that this work illustrates. d) Finally, it suggests original ideas with respect to areas of improvement according to the available data. In this point, the main conclusions of the article are as follows: 1) Public policies regarding the access to public employment of disabled people tend to be limited to comply with the regulation. Such compliance is purely formal and constrained to the reserved quota. Nevertheless, data show that the quota is not fulfilled in practice, and no information is available regarding the reasons for this. 2) The legislation should be oriented differently in diverse fronts: access systems (their characteristics make them particularly burdensome for disabled people), structural vision of the professional career of public servants (i.e. taking into account not only access, but also individual needs of disabled people), training plans.. 3) Any design of public policies on this issue requires of available data to check the plans effectiveness and deadweight loss. Previous assessment (in order to set the needs to be attacked by the plans) and posterior (regarding plans' accomplishment) are essential elements. In this sense, the Third Action Plan of the Autonomous Community of Madrid shows that public employment is integrated in itself but with flaws that make not viable an in depth action with real effects. 4) Access to public employment of disabled people cannot be detached from other components with transversal nature, in particular education/training without which it is not possible to comply with the principles of merit and ability.","Article","Final","Scopus"

By achieving impressive localization accuracy under conditions of significant changes, ConvNet landmark-based approach has attracted the attention of people in several research communities including autonomous vehicles. Such an approach relies heavily on the outstanding discrimination power of ConvNet features to match detected landmarks between images. However, a major challenge of this approach is how to extract discriminative ConvNet features efficiently. To address this challenging, inspired by the high efficiency of the region of interest (RoI) pooling layer, we propose a Multiple RoI (MRoI) pooling technique, an enhancement of RoI, and a simple yet efficient ConvNet feature extraction method. Our idea is to leverage MRoI pooling to exploit multilevel and multiresolution information from multiple convolutional layers and then fuse them to improve the discrimination capacity of the final ConvNet features. The main advantages of our method are (a) high computational efficiency for real-time applications; (b) GPU memory efficiency for mobile applications; and (c) use of pretrained model without fine-tuning or retraining for easy implementation. Experimental results on four datasets have demonstrated not only the above advantages but also the high discriminating power of the extracted ConvNet features with state-of-the-art localization accuracy. © 2017 Yi Hou et al.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It is mainly used to efficiently manage humans’ and agents’ shared control of autonomous systems and maintain humans’ global control over the agents. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply the LAA model in an agent-based autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system. The UAV system implementation consists of two parts: software and hardware. The software part represents the controller and the cognitive, and the hardware represents the computing machinery and the actuator of the UAV system. The UAV system performs three experimental scenarios of dance, surveillance and search missions. The selected scenarios demonstrate different behaviors in order to create a suitable test plan and ensure significant results. Findings: The results of the UAV system tests prove that segregating the autonomy of a system as multi-dimensional and adjustable layers enables humans and/or agents to perform actions at convenient autonomy levels. Hence, reducing the adjustable autonomy drawbacks of constraining the autonomy of the agents, increasing humans’ workload and exposing the system to disturbances. Originality/value: The application of the LAA model in a UAV manifests the significance of implementing dynamic adjustable autonomy. Assessing the autonomy within three phases of agents run cycle (task-selection, actions-selection and actions-execution) is an original idea that aims to direct agents’ autonomy toward performance competency. The agents’ abilities are well exploited when an incompetent agent switches with a more competent one. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Recent events showed that illicit or hostile uses constitute an emergent, quickly evolutionary threat. Recent developments in UAV technologies tend to bring autonomous, highly agile and capable unmanned aerial vehicles to the market. These UAVs can be used for spying operations as well as for transporting illicit or hazardous material (smuggling, flying improvised explosive devices). The scenario of interest concerns the protection of sensitive zones against the potential threat constituted by small drones. In the recent past, field trials were carried out to investigate the detection and tracking of multiple UAV flying at low altitude. Here, we present results which were achieved using a heterogeneous sensor network consisting of acoustic antennas, small FMCW RADAR systems and optical sensors. While acoustics and RADAR was applied to monitor a wide azimuthal area (360°), optical sensors were used for sequentially identification. The localization results have been compared to the ground truth data to estimate the efficiency of each detection system. Seven-microphone acoustic arrays allow single source localization. The mean azimuth and elevation estimation error has been measured equal to 1.5 and -2.5 degrees respectively. The FMCW radar allows tracking of multiple UAVs by estimating their range, azimuth and motion speed. Both technologies can be linked to the electro-optical system for final identification of the detected object. © 2017 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The landslide, resulting in the collapse of a 5 km segment of Mount Akdag, covers an area of 9.8 km2 and has a volume of about 3 × 108 m3. The 1:15,000 scale geomorphological map (Main Map) of the Akdag landslide presented here was produced from a combination of field studies and unmanned aerial vehicle-based DSM, including aerial-photo interpretation and geomorphometric analysis of landforms. The map shows contemporary and past geomorphological hillslope processes and landforms associated with the landslide complex. Our new map suggests that the Akdag landslide was a complex rockslide consisting of multiple landslide types that developed through various movements. We found that 43 highly developed and active mass movements on the main body and side slopes of the landslide made a major contribution to the sediment input. The sediment produced in the upstream severely threatens the touristic site of Saklikent Canyon in the lower catchment via an increasing magnitude of torrents. This map will provide important data for local and national administrators regarding monitoring up-to-date mass-wasting processes, understanding the landslide and its related sedimentary dynamics, and implementing risk assessment and necessary precautions. © 2017 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

This paper capitalizes on this potential by proposing a swarm-intelligence inspired approach towards mapping complex offshore oil spills - one that uses a collaborating team of small (inexpensive) unmanned aerial vehicles. By leveraging the idea of occupancy grids, a new probability map concept is developed to enable agent-level situational awareness, while significantly reducing computing overheads (image data to intelligence generation in 1 sec) and communication overheads ( 1.7 KB of average data sharing across the swarm agents). The probability map is further exploited for waypoint planning using the principles of swarm dynamics and a rule-based reasoning approach to allow for dynamic preference shifts towards map exploitation and exploration. Detection of oil is performed by using a generalizable concept of anomaly detection that is derived from a color-based segmentation approach. Two simulated case studies, derived from actual oil spill images, are presented with results highlighting the strengths of the proposed approach. © Copyright 2017 ASME.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Their applications are vast, owing to the ability to use them in economical communication channels with lower bandwidth and higher latency. Agents might attempt to acquire information from other agents or nodes in the cluster to accomplish their objectives in agent-based frameworks. Based on the processing performed at each node, the agent saves its state decides its path autonomously and resumes operation at the next node. Such operations in open situations may lead to many threats to agents like attack by malicious hosts, other malicious agents. This paper proposes a model to satisfy the security concern. A secure trusted network is established before allowing for the communication among the agents. This provides an access control mechanism against malicious hosts. Each agent is facilitated with its own set of public and private keys using DSA and Triple-DES secures the messages by encrypting them, thus protecting them from malicious agents. This paper gives insight into the proposed model by implementing the agent framework using JADE. The experiments carried out show that the proposed method used for encryption is very secure since Triple DES encryption is done and the possibility of breach is very less. © Research India Publications.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Sense and avoid algorithms can be based upon either active or passive sensing methods. Each of them has advantages when compared to the other but neither is sufficient by itself. Therefore, especially for application such as autonomous navigation where failure could be catastrophic, deploying both passive and active sensors simultaneously and utilizing inputs from them become critical to detect and avoid objects in a reliable way. As part of the solution, in this paper, we present an efficient SAA algorithm based on input from multiple stereo cameras, which can be implemented on a low-cost and low-power embedded processor. In this algorithm, we construct an instantaneous 3D occupancy grid (OG) map at each time instance using the disparity information from the stereo cameras. Then, we filter noise using spacial information, and further filter noise using a probabilistic approach based on temporal information. Using this OG Map, we detect threats to the drone in order to determine the best trajectory for it to reach a destination. © 2017, Society for Imaging Science and Technology.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Robots can climb stairs, open doors, win Jeopardy, analyze stocks, work in factories, find parking spaces, advise oncologists. In the past, automation was considered a threat to low-skilled labor. Now, many high-skilled functions, including interpreting medical images, doing legal research, and analyzing data, are within the skill sets of machines. How can higher education prepare students for their professional lives when professions themselves are disappearing? In Robot-Proof, Northeastern University president Joseph Aoun proposes a way to educate the next generation of college students to invent, to create, and to discover -- to fill needs in society that even the most sophisticated artificial intelligence agent cannot.A “robot-proof” education, Aoun argues, is not concerned solely with topping up students’ minds with high-octane facts. Rather, it calibrates them with a creative mindset and the mental elasticity to invent, discover, or create something valuable to society -- a scientific proof, a hip-hop recording, a web comic, a cure for cancer. Aoun lays out the framework for a new discipline, humanics, which builds on our innate strengths and prepares students to compete in a labor market in which smart machines work alongside human professionals. The new literacies of Aoun’s humanics are data literacy, technological literacy, and human literacy. Students will need data literacy to manage the flow of big data, and technological literacy to know how their machines work, but human literacy -- the humanities, communication, and design -- to function as a human being. Life-long learning opportunities will support their ability to adapt to change.The only certainty about the future is change.

Systems envisaging decision-making capabilities and equipped with flexible levels of autonomy are needed to support UAVs controllers in monitoring operations. The aim of this paper is to build an adjustable autonomy system able to assist UAVs controllers by predicting mental workload changes when the number of UAVs to be monitored highly increases. The proposed system adjusts its level of autonomy by discriminating situations in which operators’ abilities are sufficient to perform UAV supervision tasks from situations in which system suggestions or interventions may be required. Then, a user study was performed to create a mental-workload prediction model based on operators’ cognitive demand in drone monitoring operations.

We consider an application scenario in which a target, made of a visual pattern, is mounted on the top of a ground vehicle which roams in an arena using a certain path and velocity; the UAV is asked to find the ground vehicle, by detecting the visual pattern, and then to track it in order to perform the approach and finalize the landing. To this aim, Computer Vision is adopted to perform both detection and tracking of the visual target; the algorithm used is based on the TLD (Tracking-Learning-Detection) approach, suitably integrated with an Hough Transform able to improve the precision of the identification of the 3D coordinates of the pattern. The output of the Computer Vision algorithm is then exploited by a Kalman filter which performs the estimation of the trajectory of the ground vehicle in order to let the UAV track, follow and approach it.

This simulated game took into account the player's ability to quickly integrate disparate information about available targets, based on some gaming scenarios. These gaming scenarios included a variety of established rules of engagement, attending to four factors: 1) proximity to the nearest hostile force, 2) lethality or probability of attack of the nearest hostile force, 3) duration of the time stranded, and 4) survivability in the game. Results demonstrated a change in perceived workload as a result of repeated exposure to the software, and indicated that familiarity with particular programming interfaces may help predict performance in the Stealth Adapt task.

The present study is devoted to building a simulation model of a swarm of autonomous ground-based vehicles. It is assumed that the vehicles perform collaborative surveillance and threat mitigation activities under difficult environmental conditions. Their performance is evaluated as the efficiency of threat mitigation during a single operation cycle, the total damage sustained by the vehicles during the operation, as well as a factor related to operational costs. We will take into account the vulnerability of the LAN communication under the different circumstances that may occur during the swarm operation. Based on the simulation model implemented in Matlab, it has been shown that vehicles endowed with anticipatory decision algorithms and organized in an anticipatory network perform considerably better compared to the behavior that follows a natural swarm benchmark algorithm. The advantage of an anticipatory network organization is particularly salient in case of communication disturbances. In summary, a smooth operation of the swarm can be ensured either by a reliable communication between vehicles via a local network or by implementing an anticipatory self-organization algorithm. Specifically, the latter can compensate for permanent communication deficiencies and may be particularly useful in case of its temporary fallouts due to unexpected disturbances. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This information allows them to define the transforming functions where virtual data is converted into actionable cybersecurity knowledge. The ABS virtual vessel concept is the computational representation of the data that is sensed, stored, analyzed and transferred as actionable information on a marine or offshore asset. This paper discusses the concept through experiments designed to evaluate assumptions and hypotheses in a purpose-built cybersecurity test laboratory. Increasing use of integrated control systems onboard the assets and complex integrated technology in the maritime and offshore industry to manage business comes with a higher risk of cyberattacks. These attacks are getting more sophisticated and, in many cases, can have significant impacts on critical areas of operation. Maritime control system software is not constrained by the same physical laws that predict the physical behavior of equipment and vessels. Software systems behave differently and are evaluated by very different metrics. Because behavioral and security test methods are often conducted on in-service assets, comprehensive testing is impractical and potentially hazardous to perform onboard an asset. Therefore, assessments of cybersecurity solutions and guidelines are performed more on simulated systems in a laboratory environment rather than on actual in-service systems. ABS is developing cybersecurity ""use cases"" in which patterns of cybersecurity threats, risks and solutions can be examined, characterized and gauged using field device level information for marine and offshore systems. This research can help the industry understand the nature and risks imposed on virtual vessel computerized elements and inform the development of guidelines and rules to increase the safety and security of real vessels.

The extreme topography of the Hawaiian Islands often requires natural resource managers to use manned helicopters to survey these invasive plants. The frequency of these operations is constrained by cost and weather conditions, impacting the effectiveness of control efforts. Herbicide Ballistic Technology (HBT) consists of encapsulated herbicide formulations in soft-gel projectiles delivered by an electro-pneumatic marker. The HBT platform is a valuable tool to treat isolated plant targets during surveillance operations, and removes the need for an additional intervention. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) provide an on-demand platform for remote sensing and have been used for mapping of plants and animals of interest (e.g., invasive and endangered) in wildlife conservation. We have developed a UAS compatible HBT platform (HBT-UAS) to rapidly deliver pesticides to targets from a UAS. Adaptation of the HBT platform to provide UAS with treatment capabilities will reduce the demand for manned aerial operations in some areas, allowing these resources to be applied in areas that are not compatible with UAS limitations.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The information flows among the various domains provide insights into the vulnerabilities that exist in the system and whether the model is nondeducible. If nondeducibility is found to be true, then an attacker can create an undetectable attack. Defeating nondeducibility requires additional information sources, including invariants pertaining to vehicle platoon operation.

The reason behind this extended attack vector is the multiple external interfaces of vehicles and minimal internal security protection. Hence, it is totally possible for adversaries to take full control of connected cars. In this paper, we propose an efficient Vehicular Intrusion Detection System (IDS), named as VIDS, which consists of a lightweight domain-based detection model for ECU devices and a comprehensive crossdomain-based detection model for a gateway or domain controller. The former makes use of specification periodic features of Controller Area Network (CAN) frames, while the latter exploits stream bit value features with deep learning techniques. With the use of real vehicular normal datasets and synthesized abnormal datasets for experimenting, the experimental results indicate that the proposed VIDS can achieve better detection rate over existing IDS systems.

In almost every industry, employee performance appraisal is done manually which may lead to favoritisms. This paper proposes a framework to perform automatic employee performance appraisal based on data sensed from IoT. The framework classifies raw IoT data into three activities (Positive, Negative, Neutral), co-locates employee and activity in order to calculate employee implication and then performs cognitive decision making using fuzzy logic. From the experiments carried out it is observed that automatic system has improved performance of employees. Also the impact of the proposed system leads to motivation among employees. The simulation results show how fuzzy approach can be exploited to reward or penalize employees based on their performance. Copyright © 2017 Tech Science Press.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This research improves the prior work by enhancing the obstacle avoidance capability to handle moving obstacles as well as stationary obstacles. A mathematical representation of the area of operation with obstacles is formulated by PTEM (Probabilistic Threat Exposure Map). The PTEM quantifies the risk in being at a position in an area with different types of obstacles. A LRF (Laser Range Finder) sensor is mounted on the UGV for obstacle data in the area that is used to construct the PTEM. A guidance algorithm processes the PTEM and generates the speed and heading commands to steer the UGV to assigned waypoints while avoiding obstacles. The main contribution of this research is to improve the PTEM framework by updating it continuously as new LRF readings are obtained, on the contrary to the prior work with fixed PTEM. The improved PTEM construction algorithm is implemented in a MATLAB/Simulink simulation environment that includes models of the UGV, LRF, all the sensors and actuators needed for the control of the UGV. The performance of the algorithm is also demonstrated in real time experiments with an actual UGV system. © Copyright 2017 ASME.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Student projects intended to give some of that understanding need to be based on information available from the 60 years since Sputnik 1 went into orbit. This paper extracts some of the underlying factors which influence designing for space from launch to low orbit, travel in deep space and coping with asteroid, moon and planetary environments. From autonomous probes to the complications of human crew and even extra-terrestrial colonization could all be part of the career path for designers now on higher education courses. This paper is intended to give an introduction to the challenges which could form part of design teaching or a foundation for literature research. Some differences from the normal Earth environment are quite subtle, but can have profound effects on design thinking. Students introduced to these factors usually rise enthusiastically to the challenge influencing their approach to other unrelated design activities.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Yet, to date, there is no solution for reliably deploying at the point of need the gold standard diagnostic method, real time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), in a laboratory infrastructure-free manner. In this proof of principle work, we demonstrate direct performance of RT-qPCR on fresh blood using far-red fluorophores to resolve fluorogenic signal inhibition and controlled, rapid freeze/thawing to achieve viral genome extraction in a single reaction chamber assay. The resulting process is entirely free of manual or automated sample pre-processing, requires no microfluidics or magnetic/mechanical sample handling and thus utilizes low cost consumables. This enables a fast, laboratory infrastructure-free, minimal risk and simple standard operating procedure suited to frontline, field use. Developing this novel approach on recombinant bacteriophage and recombinant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; Lentivirus), we demonstrate clinical utility in symptomatic EBOV patient screening using live, infectious Filoviruses and surrogate patient samples. Moreover, we evidence assay co-linearity independent of viral particle structure that may enable viral load quantification through pre-calibration, with no loss of specificity across an 8log-linear maximum dynamic range.

Indeed, reduced function of this potassium channel involved in the repolarization of the cardiac action potential can produce a type of life-threatening cardiac ventricular arrhythmias called Torsades de Pointes (TdP). Therefore, hERG inhibitory activity of newly synthetized molecules is a relevant structure-activity metric for compound prioritization and optimization in medicinal chemistry phases of drug discovery. Electrophysiology remains the gold standard for the functional assessment of ion channel pharmacology. The recent years have witnessed automatization and parallelization of the manual patch-clamp technique, allowing higher throughput screening on recombinant hERG channels. However, the multi-well plate format of automatized patch-clamp does not allow visual detection of potential micro-precipitation of poorly soluble compounds.

From our point of view, automatic video change detection for aerial images can be useful to recognize functional activities which are typically caused by the deployment of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), e.g. excavations, skid marks, footprints, left-behind tooling equipment, and marker stones. Furthermore, in case of natural disasters, like flooding, imminent danger can be recognized quickly. Due to the necessary flight range, we concentrate on fixed wing UAVs. Automatic change detection can be reduced to a comparatively simple photogrammetric problem when the perspective change between the ""before"" and ""after"" image sets is kept as small as possible. Therefore, the aerial image acquisition demands a mission planning with a clear purpose including flight path and sensor configuration. While the latter can be enabled simply by a fixed and meaningful adjustment of the camera, ensuring a small perspective change for ""before"" and ""after"" videos acquired by fixed wing UAVs is a challenging problem. Concerning this matter, we have performed tests with an advanced commercial off the shelf (COTS) system which comprises a differential GPS and autopilot system estimating the repetition accuracy of its trajectory. Although several similar approaches have been presented,23 as far as we are able to judge, the limits for this important issue are not estimated so far. Furthermore, we design a process chain to enable the practical utilization of video change detection. It consists of a front-end of a database to handle large amounts of video data, an image processing and change detection implementation, and the visualization of the results. We apply our process chain on the real video data acquired by the advanced COTS fixed wing UAV and synthetic data. For the image processing and change detection, we use the approach of Müller.4 Although it was developed for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), it enables a near real time video change detection for aerial videos.

Abundant body of research has attempted to address the physical security aspects of CPS; however, research addressing the human dimensions of cyber-attack detection and responses from an operator and operational perspective is sparse. This research has provided a novel probe into the human factors affecting operator resilience in responding to cyber-attacks, which are situations characterized by uncertainty and malicious intent. The variability of individual operators makes it improbable to grasp the full range of factors contributing to operator performance; however, the application of Suspicion Theory as proposed by Bobko et al. (2013), provides a starting point to aid in understanding operator performance in situations involving malicious intent (e.g. a cyber-attack). According to the theory, malicious intent is a critical component of operator suspicion, which is a key factor in operator response to cyber-attacks. The current research explored this human dimension through scenario-based, human-in-the-loop simulation experiments with Air Force personnel. It included both abstract and empirical assessments of the application of Suspicion Theory to operator detection and responses to cyber-attacks against an unmanned vehicle system, and it took a systems-oriented approach to the problem by considering the interaction of a Human-Machine Team (HMT) in the response. The HMT here refers to an operator and a Sentinel, which is an automated cyber-attack detection aid. The study evaluated the effects of suspicion, as well as the effects of perceived consequence, on the operator, and the resulting HMT quality of performance in responding to alerts, including both false alarms and properly detected cyber-attack scenarios. The findings show that Sentinel alerts alone do not create operator suspicion. Instead, alerts can serve as a catalyst for a wider information search by the operator, which, on a situational basis can lead to formation of increased operator suspicion. The analysis of experimental results pointed to a negative correlation between operator suspicion and performance score that measured the quality of a response to the given scenario. In addition, a strong correlation between HMT performance score and task response time was noted. Copyright 2017 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To facilitate their rapid uptake and penetration, autonomous vehicles (AVs) should ensure that occupants are both safe and comfortable. Recent research, however, revealed that people felt uncomfortable when AVs braked. This may be caused by the robotlike braking performance. Existing studies on drivers' braking behavior investigated data from either controlled experiments or driving simulators. There is a dearth of research on braking behavior in normal driving. The objective of the study was to examine drivers' braking behaviors by exploiting naturalistic driving data from the Pan-European TeleFOT project (Field Operational Tests of Aftermarket and Nomadic Devices in Vehicles). On a fixed route of 16.5 km, 16 drivers were asked to drive an instrumented vehicle. About 11 million observations were analyzed to identify the profile, value, and duration of deceleration events. Since deceleration events are nested within trips and trips within drivers, multilevel mixed-effects linear models were employed to develop relationships between deceleration value and duration and the factors influencing them. Results indicate that the most-used profile of the deceleration behavior follows a hard braking at the beginning when detecting a danger and then becomes smoother. Furthermore, the results suggest that the speed, reason for braking, and deceleration profile mostly affect the deceleration events. Findings from this study should be considered in examining the braking behavior of AVs.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The applications of swarm technology to unmanned systems are in the infancy of realization, although clear benefits from the enhanced capabilities can be easily envisioned for commercial and government missions including persistent search, long-term monitoring, sensor data collection, object retrieval, and offensive attack missions. Designing a UAV swarm architecture without considering the mission doctrine is imprudent, as is developing a mission doctrine without understanding the unique capabilities of swarm technology. This paper provides a literature review of current UAV swarm design architectures, most of which employ bottom-up methods with little consideration for an intended operational mission. The proposed top-down framework and modeling approach is focused on developing a modular UAV swarm playbook-type architecture by decomposing a subset of US Navy missions, and developing tactics that can be applied to those missions and support future missions. The framework proposed herein is derived from a consolidation of heuristics from the model-based systems engineering, robotics, human systems integration, biology, and computer science disciplines. The goal of this framework is to provide a standard methodology for designing and operating swarm unmanned systems that will meet the performance requirements for military missions.

Continuously increasing requirements in gear technology regarding high power density, low noise, weight and costs as well as small gearbox size, lead to growing demand of optimized gear designs. The calculation of load carrying capacity for the tooth root delivers an easy to apply methodology, but does not fully exploit the potential of creating extremely lightweight, yet strong enough gears. Therefore, methods are needed that enable exact predictions of load carrying capacity based on local strain and material properties. FE-based methods are capable of evaluating local stresses in the tooth root accurately. In combination with local material strength models such as the Inclusion-Based Weakest Link Model, accurate lifetime predictions of gears can be made. In this paper, a combinational approach of the FE-based tooth contact analysis, together with the Inclusion-Based Weakest Link Model, is presented. A helical gear set will be investigated based on gear geometry and measured material properties such as Vickers hardness, residual stresses and material defects. A new approach to determine the material defects via automated microsection analysis is presented. To determine the defect size inside of the gear material, breakage surfaces were analyzed and then statistically evaluated in past research activities at the Laboratory for Machine Tools and Production Engineering in Aachen. This method is time consuming, and necessitates the generation of gear breakages in tests before the actual simulation.

From this perspective, this article aims to highlight the perils of maritime navigation attacks, showing the need for the enhancement of standards and security measures to intercept any serious threats to marine vessels emanating from cyber attacks and GPS spoofing. To this end, we consider a case where a cyber attacker blocks the real GPS signals and dupes the GPS antennas on board the marine vehicle with fake signals.

However, GPS is vulnerable to many intentional threats such as the GPS signal spoofing, where an attacker can deceive a GPS receiver by broadcasting incorrect GPS signals. Defense against such attacks is critical to ensure the reliability and security of UAVs. In this work, we propose a signaling game framework in which the GPS receiver can strategically infer the true location when the attacker attempts to mislead it with a fraudulent and purposefully crafted signal. We characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions of perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) of the game and observe that the equilibrium has a PLASH structure, i.e., pooling in low types and separating in high types. This structure enables the development of a game-theoretic security mechanism to defend against the civil GPS signal spoofing for civilian UAVs. Our results show that in the separating part of the PLASH PBE, the civilian UAV can infer its true position under the spoofing attack while in the pooling portion of the PLASH PBE, the corresponding equilibrium strategy allows the civilian UAV to rationally decide the position that minimizes the deviation from its true position. Numerical experiments are used to corroborate our results and observations. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The control scheme is proposed with two levels where the inner level utilizes agreement or consensus protocol to derive reference positions for the follower AUVs whereas the outer loop employs a sliding mode controller (SMC) to reduce the tracking error to zero. SMC being a suitable candidate for handling is chosen because of its inherent robustness to any uncertainties and disturbances, it is intended to design a SMC to address the problem of handling uncertainties in the hydrodynamic parameters of the AUV dynamics and has been used to steer each AUV in the flock to their desired states. By exploiting the consensus protocol and SMC, it can be ensured that once an AUV comes into the neighbour zone (maximum range for information exchange for a member AUV outside which no communication is possible) cannot be separated from the group. Therefore, this controller structure is suitable for flocking of multiple AUVs where communication constraints play a vital role in efficient performance of control algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed controller scheme is demonstrated through MATLAB simulation.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The disease is life threatening if left untreated in neonates and the only available treatment option is a long-term galactose restricted diet. While this is lifesaving in the neonate, complications persist in treated individuals, and the cause of these, despite early initiation of treatment, and shared GALT genotypes remain poorly understood. Systemic abnormal glycosylation has been proposed to contribute substantially to the ongoing pathophysiology. The gross N-glycosylation assembly defects observed in the untreated neonate correct over time with treatment. However, N-glycosylation processing defects persist in treated children and adults. Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a large group of over 100 inherited disorders affecting largely N- and O-glycosylation.

Mobility focuses on ground vehicles' capabilities that enable them to be deployable worldwide, operationally mobile in all environments, and protected from symmetrical and asymmetrical threats. In order for military ground vehicles to operate in any combat zone, mobility on off-road terrains should be extensively investigated. Mobility on off-road terrains is poorly understood because of the empirical and semi-empirical methods used in predicting the mobility map. These methods do not capture the soil deformation as well as its non-linear behavior. The discrete element method (DEM) was identified as a high-fidelity method that can capture the deformation of the soil and its non-linear behavior. The DEM method allows to simulate the vehicle on any off-road terrain and to generate an accurate mobility map. In this paper, a simulation study was undertaken to understand the influence of soil characteristics on mobility parameters such as wheel sinkage, wheel slip, vehicle speed, and tractive force. The interaction of the vehicle wheels with soft soil is poorly understood, this study helps understand this interaction. A nominal wheeled vehicle model was built in the DIS/IVRESS software and simulated over different cohesive and non-cohesive soils modeled using DEM. Some characteristics of these soils were varied namely, the soil inter-particle cohesion, the soil inter-particle friction, the soil particle size, and the soil density. The mobility parameters were measured and correlated to the soil characteristics. This study showed that the vehicle speed increased with cohesion, friction, soil density, and particle size, while wheel sinkage and wheel slip decreased with those parameters. The influence of these characteristics combined is more complex; extensive studies of other soil characteristics need to be carried out in the future to understand their effect on vehicle mobility. © Copyright 2017 ASME.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The autonomous agents are guided by high-level process models, with which human operators interact for orchestrating lower-level autonomous agents.

In order to obtain a chaotic mobile robot, the chaotic signals are used to generate True RNGs (TRNGs), which, as is known, exploit the nondeterministic nature of chaotic controllers. Then, the bits obtained from TRNGs can be continuously mapped to coordinates (xn, yn) for positioning the robot on the terrain. A frequent technique to obtain a chaotic bitstream is to sample analog chaotic signals by using thresholds. However, the performance of chaotic path planning is a function of optimal values for those levels. In this framework, several chaotic systems which are used to obtain TRNGs but by computing a quasi-optimal performance surface for the thresholds is presented. The proposed study is based on sweeping the Poincaré sections to find quasi-optimal values for thresholds where the coverage rate is higher than those obtained by using the equilibrium points as reference values. Various scenarios are evaluated. First, two scroll chaotic systems such as Chua's circuit, saturated function, and Lorenz are used as entropy sources to obtain TRNGS by using its computed performance surface. Afterwards, n-scrolls chaotic systems are evaluated to get chaotic bitstreams with the analyzed performance surface. Another scenario is dedicated to find the performance surface of hybrid chaotic systems, which are composed by three chaotic systems where one chaotic system determines which one of the remaining chaotic signals will be used to obtain the chaotic bitstream. Additionally, TRNGs from two chaotic systems with optimized Lyapunov exponents are studied. Several numerical simulations to compute diverse metrics such as coverage rate against planned points, robot's trajectory evolution, covered terrain, and color map are carried out to analyze the resulting TRNGs. This investigation will enable to increase several applications of TRNGs by considering the proposed performance surfaces. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to diagnosis of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall cost of the devices, ECG interpretation, and patient management were captured and used to generate the cost per AF diagnosis in iECG patients. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also evaluated. RESULTS: We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4-10.4; P=0.007) at a cost per AF diagnosis of $10 780 (£8255). There was a similar number of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; hazard ratio=0.61; 95% confidence interval=0.22-1.69; P=0.34). The majority of iECG patients were satisfied with the device, finding it easy to use without restricting activities or causing anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Screening with twice-weekly single-lead iECG with remote interpretation in ambulatory patients ≥65 years of age at increased risk of stroke is significantly more likely to identify incident AF than RC over a 12-month period. This approach is also highly acceptable to this group of patients, supporting further evaluation in an appropriately powered, event-driven clinical trial. © 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Millions of apps exist that support users in multiple ways, e.g., for car navigation, fitness purposes, or messaging in our private lives, but also for business planning purposes and even for controlling whole business processes. Failures in mobile business apps can lead to dramatic consequences in terms of lost revenue, but also in terms of lost trust or even threats for human beings, and thus quality plays a crucial role. On the other hand, as software is nowadays one of the main drivers for innovation, fast delivery of new apps, respectively new functionality, is necessary, i.e., the time to market must often be short. However, in order to understand whether the quality is sufficient, and whether the functionality of the app serves the needs of the users, lean development approaches are emerging and propose the deployment of apps as a minimal viable product (MVP). Here, the app is provided with acceptable quality, but not with every feature, just with the main functionality. Based on such an MVP, early feedback from users is to be collected, which may be related to the quality of the app, but also include wishes and requests for new functionality. In order to analyze and draw conclusions from user feedback, we first have to understand what kind of feedback exists and how it can be interpreted, respectively how valid such feedback is.

With potential applications including perception modules and end-to-end controllers for self-driving cars, this raises concerns about their safety. We develop a novel automated verification framework for feed-forward multi-layer neural networks based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT). We focus on safety of image classification decisions with respect to image manipulations, such as scratches or changes to camera angle or lighting conditions that would result in the same class being assigned by a human, and define safety for an individual decision in terms of invariance of the classification within a small neighbourhood of the original image. We enable exhaustive search of the region by employing discretisation, and propagate the analysis layer by layer. Our method works directly with the network code and, in contrast to existing methods, can guarantee that adversarial examples, if they exist, are found for the given region and family of manipulations. If found, adversarial examples can be shown to human testers and/or used to fine-tune the network. We implement the techniques using Z3 and evaluate them on state-of-the-art networks, including regularised and deep learning networks.

These devices are based on the processing of electromagnetic or acoustic signatures associated with the firing of a gun. This work is concerned with the latter, where the shooter's position can be obtained based on the estimation of the direction-of-arrival (DoA) of the acoustic components of a gunshot signal (muzzle blast and shock wave). A major limitation of current commercially available acoustic sniper localization systems is the impossibility of finding the shooter's position when one of these acoustic signatures is not detected. This is very likely to occur in real-life situations, especially when the microphones are not in the field of view of the shockwave or when the presence of obstacles like buildings can prevent a direct-path to sensors. This work addresses the problem of DoA estimation of the muzzle blast using a planar array of sensors deployed in a drone. Results supported by actual gunshot data from a realistic setup are very promising and pave the way for the development of enhanced sniper localization systems featuring two main advantages over stationary ones: (1) wider surveillance area; and (2) increased likelihood of a direct-path detection of at least one of the gunshot signals, thereby adding robustness and reliability to the system. © 2017 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, the maneuverability of UAV with FMWs is rather limited as it is impossible to install conventional ailerons. The maneuver relies only on the rudders. Some applications utilize torque rods to warp the wings, but this approach makes the FMW become unfoldable. In this research, we proposed the application of a tendon-sheath mechanism to manipulate the wing shape of UAV. Tendon-sheath mechanism is relatively flexible; thus, it can also be folded together with the wings. However, its severe nonlinearity in its dynamics makes the wing warping difficult to control. To compensate for the nonlinearity, a dedicated adaptive controller is designed and implemented. The proposed approach is validated experimentally in a wind tunnel facility with imitated gusty condition and subsequently tested in a real flight condition. The results demonstrate a stable and robust wing warping actuation, while the adaptive washout capability is also validated. Accurate wing warping is achieved and the UAV is easily controlled in a real flight test. © 2017 Tegoeh Tjahjowidodo and Shian Lee.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In the first step, computational fluid dynamics simulations are conducted for different airfoils, each of which exhausts heat from different regions on the upper surface, at different angles of attack. This parametric study reveals that early transition near the leading edge is favorable to improve heat-exhaust characteristics, although it may increase skin friction. In addition, heat exhaust should be conducted only in the region of turbulent boundary layer behind the transition point. From these results, the airfoil shape significantly affects the Nusselt-number distribution along the upper wing surface due to the change in the location of laminar-turbulent transition and turbulent boundary-layer separation. In the next step, multi-objective optimization of an airfoil shape, which balances aerodynamic performance and heat-exhaust performance, is carried out. The obtained nondominated solutions show the tradeoffs between aerodynamic performance and heat-exhaust performance. It was confirmed that heat-exhaust performance can be controlled by the location of the laminar-turbulent transition, and improved without sacrificing aerodynamic performance at the cruising condition. © Copyright 2016 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

In 2013, Zhang et al. have proposed an improved authentication protocol for SIP. Then, they showed that their protocol is secured against various attacks. However, in this work we prove that Zhang et al.’s protocol is unsecured against server spoofing attack. As result, we propose a new SIP authentication protocol to overcome the weakness.

Augmented reality head-mounted displays, such as the Microsoft HoloLens, make it possible to view 3-D data overlaid on the real world. This allows a user to view and interact with the data in ways similar to how they would interact with a physical 3-D object, such as moving, rotating, or walking around it. A type of 3-D data that is particularly useful for military applications is geo-specific 3-D terrain data, and the visualization of this data is critical for training, mission planning, intelligence, and improved situational awareness. Advances in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), photogrammetry software, and rendering hardware have drastically reduced the technological and financial obstacles in collecting aerial imagery and in generating 3-D terrain maps from that imagery. Because of this, there is an increased need to develop new tools for the exploitation of 3-D data. We will demonstrate how the HoloLens can be used as a tool for visualizing 3-D terrain data. We will describe: 1) how UAScollected imagery is used to create 3-D terrain maps, 2) how those maps are deployed to the HoloLens, 3) how a user can view and manipulate the maps, and 4) how multiple users can view the same virtual 3-D object at the same time. © 2017 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In open terrain a radar can detect and track even small UAVs at long distances. In an urban environment with limited line-of-sight and strong static and non-static background, this capability can be severely reduced. The radar cross section of these UAVs are normally small compared to the background. However, the rotors of the UAVs produce a characteristic micro-Doppler signature that can be exploited for detection and classification. In this paper, we investigate in an experimental set-up whether it is possible in the radar non-line-of-sight to retrieve the micro-Doppler signature of the UAV rotors. This is done by exploring up to three multipath bounces in the measured signal. The measurements were made with a semi-monostatic single receiver-transmitter radar system operating at X-band in a pulsed single frequency mode. The radar response of the UAV, with plastic and metallic rotors, was measured at several positions inside a 4 m wide corridor with metallic walls. In this paper, data from one line-of-sight and two non-line-ofsight positions are presented. Results show that we are able to detect the micro-Doppler of the rotors and to retrieve the number of revolutions per minute, for both rotor types. Free space Finite-Difference Time-Domain calculations have also been performed on a CAD-model of the UAV rotor to determine the optimal choice of polarization and the short-time Fourier transform filter length. © 2017 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The Islamic State does not only excel through the extensive use of high-tech weapons, social media, commercial bot, and automated text systems; by putting forward the presence of speeding cars and tanks, mobile phones, and computers, ISIS presents jihad life as connected to modern urban culture. The article shows that the aesthetics of the Islamic State is “futurist” by comparing it with Italian Futurism. Futurism glorified cars, industrial machines, and modern cities while praising violence as a means of leaving behind imitations of the past in order to project itself most efficiently into the future. A profound sense of crisis produces in both Futurism and jihadism a nihilistic attitude toward the present state of society that will be overcome through an exaltation of technology.

Indeed, businesses can greatly benefit from innovation introduced by 5G and exploit the new deep integration between ICT and networking capabilities to generate new value-added services. Although a plethora of solutions for virtual resources and infrastructures management and orchestration already exists (e.g., OpenDaylight, ONOS, OpenStack, Apache Mesos, Open Source MANO, Docker Swarm, LXD/LXC, etc.), they are still not properly integrated to match the 5G requirements.

The 5G-OP is an overarching framework capable to provide agnostic interfaces and a universal set of abstractions in order to implement seamless 5G infrastructure control and orchestration. The functional structure of the 5G-OP, including the horizontal and vertical interworking of functions in it, has been designed to allow Network Operators and Service Providers to exploit diverse roles and business strategies. Moreover, the functional decoupling of the 5G-OP from the underneath management, control and orchestration solutions allows pursuing faster innovation cycles, being ready for the emergence of new service models. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In spite of initial galvanization, periodic repainting and usage of weathering steels, corrosion is experienced in lattice structures at locations with constant exposure to moisture and inaccessibility to repaint. In the present day there are a huge number of transmission towers built of carbon and weathering steels with corrosion posing serious threats to their bearing capacity and durability. Timely inspection and repair is essential to avoid unprecedented structural failures. Employing non-destructive methods of manual inspection for large number of towers to detect corrosion and related damages is time consuming and expensive. In addition to this, the drawbacks include error due to inaccurate human judgment questionable safety of inspector to climb structures possibly weakened by corrosion. In such a situation non-contact approach of automated visual inspection for corrosion and related damage detection through image processing of aerial or ground based images is a viable option. A combination unsupervised and supervised classification methods is used to identify corroded regions in power transmission tower images using various color features of the image. The image is segmented into clusters based on the colors in L∗a∗b∗color space using K-means clustering algorithm. These segments are tested against the conditions of hue obtained from statistical analysis of hue values corresponding to a set images of corroded surfaces to identify the segment of the image with corrosion. This approach lays a foundation for content based image retrieval in the domain of corrosion detection that is the ability to identify corroded structures from a large database of inspection images. © ASCE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

We discovered a series of vulnerabilities, including insecure communication channels and misuse of cryptography. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, an attacker can eavesdrop on the data acquired or transmitted by the aircraft, impersonate the aircraft to send bogus data to the user’s mobile device, hijack the camera on the aircraft or the aircraft itself, and prevent the aircraft from communicating with the user’s mobile device. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2017.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

These new ABCs have some specific characteristics, such as a structural configuration divided into two devices: selfenrolment kiosk and biometric gate, one for enrolment and the other one for verification, which entails two capture stages and two weaknesses where it is possible to attack the system. The tests were carried out with a pilot of the system, implemented at T4-S (T4 satellite) terminal of Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport. Our experiments have tested the security of the system by simulating several presentation attacks, at both stages of the system. For these attacks, different artefacts proposed in the literature about Presentation Attack Detection have been used. We present the obtained results with each of the attacks, indicating which may be more dangerous to the system and suggesting some countermeasure that could increase the reliability and security of the system.

We aim to examine how the use of graphic imagery and means of graphic communication facilitate performance, shorten the OODA loop (Observe–Orient–Decide–Act), and enhance operators’ situation awareness. Previous research (Oron-Gilad and Oppenheim 2015) looked at bi-directional graphic communication on video feed derived from an unmanned aerial system (UAS), allowing a dismounted commander and the operator of the UAS to view and communicate on the video imagery. It was concluded that the commanders favored the ability to use non-stationary markings on the video feed relative to no markings at all or anchored-fixed markings. Furthermore, the verbal communication between the team mates changed as the team gained experience over consecutive trials, and with the use of graphic communication. In the current study, we examined the added value of using still images, one-way, graphic communication from an operator, represented by Coral, tablet or UAS observers to a ground fighter, represented by either Tank (mounted) or Spike-MR (dismounted) attackers, while collaborating to acquire stationary targets in a rural built area. The abilities to communicate by using still images with or without additional markings (annotations) were aimed to be compared to a basic communication form based on ‘coordinates’ and to a future solution of augmentation of the target’s location on reality. Difficulties in accurately implementing the augmentation have severely hindered the accuracy of performance in this communication mean. Therefore, comparisons were made relative to ‘coordinates’ as a baseline and to the use of still images (with annotations or without). Verbal communication within the teams (two-way) was available at all times. Eight teams of three; ‘attacker’, ‘observer’, and ‘controller’ (as the higher echelon commander) participated in the experiment. Participant soldiers were assigned to a simulated work station according to their expertise. The dependent variables were (1) objective measures - execution, response time and accuracy, and (2) subjective evaluation of – usability, stress, and the quality of communication, and (3) verbal communication. The results show that in the Ground-Ground teams, operators benefited from the use of still images especially in the time to acquire a target and the accuracy distance from target. In contrary, still images from the UAS were less beneficial to the ground operators relative to ‘coordinates’ in terms of time to acquire a target and executions. Overall, observer-type participants favored the use of still images. When they had free choice, they chose the still image configurations almost in all cases (98%). Yet, there were differences in the way the observers and the attackers perceived the quality of the graphic communication, and there were differences, between the mounted and the dismounted attackers as well. All in all, it seems that the addition of graphic communication increased the number of ping-pong chats between the team members, but, on average, shortened the duration of each chat. From the perspective of the controllers, who were supervising the teams, they noted that the Ground-Ground teams used less verbal communication compared to the Ground-Aerial teams. Furthermore, less verbal communication was required when using the still images interface (with or without markings) compared to ‘coordinates’. We conclude that; (1) Still images may improve the communication between Ground-Ground teams; (2) In some cases, adding the ability to graphically mark elements on the still image (i.e., annotations) improved the communication in terms of self-evaluation of team cooperation and performance, even more than still images alone; (3) In presence of graphic communication, the verbal communication patterns have changed with more ‘ping-pong’ transmissions among team members although shorter ones; and (4) When participants had free choice of communication means they preferred the still images with graphic markings over the other alternatives of ‘coordinates’ and still images without markings). Further investigation is needed to test the added value of using bi-directional graphic communication (either on still images or by temporary markings on dynamic video scenes). © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

From this perspective, security guidelines such as JASO TP 15002 and SAE J3061 have been published. To realize future connected-car systems or the future autonomous driving in line with these guidelines, many automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and their major suppliers are now developing key components such as central gateways (CGW), telematics, or end Electronic Control Units (ECUs), with theses security concerns in mind. In this paper, we focus on a security evaluation that consists of model definition, threat identification, and the risk analysis in JASO TP 15002. To do so we first identify gaps between an understanding of JASO TP15002 and implementation of secure system design based on it. We then present a detailed analysis which includes new methods to fill this gap using illustrative examples such as CGW.

Due to the lack of common standards and accessibility for the applied IT systems, their potential is not yet completely exploited. Objectives: Common requirements for MDTMs shall be identified and aggregated into a process definition to be automated by an application architecture utilizing modern standards in electronic healthcare, e.g. HL7 FHIR. Methods: To identify requirements, an extensive literature review as well as semistructured expert interviews were conducted. Results: Results showed, that interoperability and flexibility in terms of the process are key requirements to be addressed. An architecture blueprint as well as an aggregated process definition were derived from the insights gained. To evaluate the feasibility of identified requirements, methods of explorative prototyping in software engineering were used. Conclusion: MDTMs will become an important part of modern and future healthcare but the need for standardization in terms of interoperability is imminent. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To exploit this potential, adaptive allocation and scheduling algorithms are needed for selecting software variants and mapping them to processing elements that attempt to achieve a good balance between resource-awareness and performance. The evaluation is typically carried out using simulation techniques. However, the space spanned by the possible combinations of hardware/software variants and management strategies is huge, which makes it nearly impossible to find an optimum using simulation-based methods. The purpose of the paper is to illustrate the general feasibility of an alternative approach using probabilistic model checking for families of systems that are obtained by varying, e.g., the hardware-software combinations or the resource management strategies. More precisely, we consider heterogeneous multi-processor systems based on tiled architectures and provide a tool chain that yields a flexible and comfortable way to specify families of concrete systems and to analyze them using the probabilistic model checker PRISM and ProFeat as a front end. We illustrate how the family-based approach can be used to analyze the potential of heterogeneous hardware elements, software variants and adaptive resource management and scheduling strategies by applying our framework to a simplified model of the multi-processor Tomahawk platform that has been designed for integrating heterogeneous devices. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

Such applications require critical sensor observations to be made at the right place and time to facilitate the detection, tracking, and classification of ground-based objects. This further requires rapid response to real-world events and the balancing of multiple, competing mission objectives. In this context, human operators become overwhelmed with management of many platforms. Further, current automated planning paradigms tend to be centralized and don't scale up well to many collaborating platforms. We introduce a decentralized approach based upon information-theory and distributed fusion which enable us to scale up to large numbers of collaborating Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) platforms. This is exercised against a military application involving the autonomous detection, tracking, and classification of critical mobile targets. We further show that, based upon monte-carlo simulation results, our decentralized approach out-performs more static management strategies employed by human operators and achieves similar results to a centralized approach while being scalable and robust to degradation of communication.

Materials and Methods: A broad range of stakeholders were engaged from conception through testing to develop measures and test feasibility, reliability, and validity following National Quality Forum guidance. We assessed data element feasibility through semistructured interviews with key stakeholders using a National Quality Forum-recommended scorecard. We created test datasets of synthetic patients to test measure implementation feasibility and reliability within and across electronic health record (EHR) systems. We validated implementation with automated reporting of EHR clinical data against manual record reviews, using the kappa statistic. Results: A stakeholder workgroup was formed and guided all development and testing processes. All critical data elements passed feasibility testing. Four test datasets, representing 577 synthetic patients, were developed and implemented within EHR vendors' software, demonstrating measure implementation feasibility. Measure reliability and validity were established through implementation at clinical practice sites, with kappa statistic values in the ""almost perfect"" agreement range of 0.80-0.99 for all but 1 measure component, which demonstrated ""substantial"" agreement. The 2 validated measures were published in the United States Health Information Knowledgebase. Conclusion: The stakeholder-engaged processes used in this study facilitated a successful measure development and testing cycle. Engaging stakeholders early and throughout development and testing promotes early identification of and attention to potential threats to feasibility, reliability, and validity, thereby averting significant resource investments that are unlikely to be fruitful. © The Author 2016.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Hence, customized video analysis systems providing functions for the analysis of subtasks like motion detection or target tracking are welcome. While such automated algorithms relieve the human operators from performing basic subtasks, they impose additional interaction duties on them. Prior work shows that, e.g., for interaction with target tracking algorithms, a gaze-enhanced user interface is beneficial. In this contribution, we present an investigation on interaction with an independent motion detection (IDM) algorithm. Besides identifying an appropriate interaction technique for the user interface - again, we compare gaze-based and traditional mouse-based interaction - we focus on the benefit an IDM algorithm might provide for an UAS video analyst. In a pilot study, we exposed ten subjects to the task of moving target detection in UAS video data twice, once performing with automatic support, once performing without it. We compare the two conditions considering performance in terms of effectiveness (correct target selections). Additionally, we report perceived workload (measured using the NASA-TLX questionnaire) and user satisfaction (measured using the ISO 9241-411 questionnaire). The results show that a combination of gaze input and automated IDM algorithm provides valuable support for the human observer, increasing the number of correct target selections up to 62% and reducing workload at the same time. © 2017 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

We introduce a new set of features that utilizes semantic information about entities as well as information from top-ranked documents using a generic search engine. The entity label is submitted as a search query to a general search engine and the top ranked documents are used to add context to the ranking process. The ranking model identifies and ranks the most important attributes (facts) of an entity. In order to experiment with our approach, we initially collected a dataset by exploiting Wikipedia infoboxes, whose ordering of attributes reflects the collaborative effort of a large community of Wikipedia users.

"Silverbolt - High speed cruising extended loitering duration UAV","2017","57th Israel Annual Conference on Aerospace Sciences, IACAS 2017","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021352276&partnerID=40&md5=fa61525624b7044d0ec71ba4b7b47a36","Silverbolt is a multi-tasks UAV, capable of cruising at high velocity on one hand, and on the other hand to have a long loitering duration. Its main purpose is detection and identification of various distance targets, while constrained to take off and land without a runaway, Silverbolt can act as a first response to immediate threats. Silverbolt is a unique UAV, as it can operate in 2 aerodynamically contradictory phases. The first phase of the mission ('Long range target' phase) requires a fast moving aircraft with minimal drag, While the second phase ('Surveilling' phase') requires an optimal gliding, thus demanding a high lift which is sadly correlated with high drag. In order to deal with the implied lift gap during the 'Surveilling' phase', high lift Fowler flaps were designed. The Silverbolt's engine layout consists of 3 engines: 2 PBS-TJ100 turbojet engines located on either sides, and 1 PBS-TP100 turbo-prop engine located in the front. The turbojet engines are designed for the first phase while the turbo-prop engine is designed for the second phase. This article summarizes the UAV design in aspect of its structure, aerodynamic, avionics systems, support systems, control, and the simulations performed to characterize performances and stability. Special attention has been taken in reviewing the UAV's innovation and uniqueness.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

"Joint deep shape and appearance learning: Application to optic pathway glioma segmentation","2017","Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging - Proceedings of SPIE","10.1117/12.2255580","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020301346&doi=10.1117%2f12.2255580&partnerID=40&md5=ce22c38db847ba479f40a0c9b9840b72","Automated tissue characterization is one of the major applications of computer-aided diagnosis systems. Deep learning techniques have recently demonstrated impressive performance for the image patch-based tissue characterization. However, existing patch-based tissue classification techniques struggle to exploit the useful shape information. Local and global shape knowledge such as the regional boundary changes, diameter, and volumetrics can be useful in classifying the tissues especially in scenarios where the appearance signature does not provide significant classification information. In this work, we present a deep neural network-based method for the automated segmentation of the tumors referred to as optic pathway gliomas (OPG) located within the anterior visual pathway (AVP; optic nerve, chiasm or tracts) using joint shape and appearance learning. Voxel intensity values of commonly used MRI sequences are generally not indicative of OPG. To be considered an OPG, current clinical practice dictates that some portion of AVP must demonstrate shape enlargement. The method proposed in this work integrates multiple sequence magnetic resonance image (T1, T2, and FLAIR) along with local boundary changes to train a deep neural network. For training and evaluation purposes, we used a dataset of multiple sequence MRI obtained from 20 subjects (10 controls, 10 NF1+OPG). To our best knowledge, this is the first deep representation learning-based approach designed to merge shape and multi-channel appearance data for the glioma detection. In our experiments, mean misclassification errors of 2:39% and 0:48% were observed respectively for glioma and control patches extracted from the AVP. Moreover, an overall dice similarity coefficient of 0:87±0:13 (0:93±0:06 for healthy tissue, 0:78±0:18 for glioma tissue) demonstrates the potential of the proposed method in the accurate localization and early detection of OPG. © 2017 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
"Artificial intelligence within the military domain and cyber warfare","2017","European Conference on Information Warfare and Security, ECCWS","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028013021&partnerID=40&md5=cf3c9039dcc88259145506b40bbeb332","The potential uses of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the cyber security domain have had a recent surge of interest. Much of the research and discussions in this area primarily focuses on reactive uses of the technology such as enhancing capabilities in incident response, aiding in the analysis of malware or helping to automate defensive positions across networks. In this paper, the authors present an overview of machine learning as an enabler to artificial intelligence and how such technology can be used within the military and cyber warfare domain. This represents a shift in focus from commercial, civilian machine learning applications that include; self-driving vehicles, speech/image/face recognition, fraud prevention, the optimisation of web searches, and so forth. While the underlying technological process remain, what is altered is the focus of application; i.e., applying machine learning to create Intelligent Virtual Assistants for the battlefield, automated scanning of satellite imagery to detect specific vehicle types, automating the selection of attack vectors and methods when conducting offensive cyber warfare, etc. machine learning solutions offer the potential to assist a Commander make decisions in real-time that are informed by the accumulated knowledge of hundreds of previous engagements and exercises that are assessed at computational speeds. With these potential use cases in mind, the authors highlight some of the legal and ethical issues that the application of weapons enhanced with artificial intelligence, machine learning and automated processes. As the authors highlight, however, there are conflict views over the ethics of weaponising these technologies. Critics question the compliance with International Humanitarian Law of automated weapon systems the exclude human judgment, charging them with threatening our fundamental right to life and the principle of human dignity. Conversely, others view this progress in weapon development as inevitable, whereby attempts to ban autonomous weapon systems would be both premature and insupportable.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Vision-based dangerous object detection is a crucial technology of autonomous driving which detects object and assesses its danger with distance to warn drivers. Previous vision-based dangerous object detections apply two independent models to deal with object detection and distance prediction, respectively. In this paper, we show that object detection and distance prediction have visual relationship, and they can be improved by exploiting the relationship. We jointly optimize object detection and distance prediction with a novel multi-task learning (MTL) model for using the relationship. In contrast to traditional MTL which uses linear multi-task combination strategy, we propose a Cartesian product-based multi-target combination strategy for MTL to consider the dependent among tasks.

The FLGPR considered in this work consists of a sensor array mounted on the front of a vehicle, which inspects an area in front of the vehicle as it moves down a lane. The FLGPR collects data using a stepped frequency approach, and the received radar data is processed by filtered backprojection to create images of the subsurface. A large body of research has focused on developing effective supervised machine learning algorithms to automatically discriminate between imagery associated with target and non-target FLGPR responses. An important component of these automated algorithms is the design of effective features (e.g., image descriptors) that are extracted from the FLGPR imagery and then provided to the machine learning classifiers (e.g., support vector machines). One feature that has recently been proposed is computed from the magnitude of the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2DFFT) of the FLGPR imagery. This paper presents a modified version of the 2DFFT feature, termed 2DFFT+, that yields substantial detection performance when compared with several other existing features on a large collection of FLGPR imagery. Further, we show that using partial least-squares discriminative dimensionality reduction, it is possible to dramatically lower the dimensionality of the 2DFFT+ feature from 2652 dimensions down to twenty dimensions (on average), while simultaneously improving its performance. © 2017 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Our group previously demonstrated that post-translational modification of serum PON1 in form of fucosylated PON1 is a potential biomarker of small cell lung cancer. Here, we interrogated the role of PON1 in the pathobiology of lung cancer (LC) by addressing cellautonomous mechanisms using gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches and protein expression profiling of tissue samples in our clinical biobank. PON1 expression in LC patient tissues varied between overexpression in squamous cell carcinoma and minimal loss in adenocarcinoma sub-types. Simultaneous overexpression of PON1 both at the gene and protein stability levels induced pro-oncogenic characteristics in LC cells and xenografts. PON1 overexpression supported metastatic progression of LC by decreasing G1/S ratio and LC cell senescence involving p21Waf1/Cip1. PON1 suppressed drug- and ligand-induced cell death and protected LC cells from genotoxic damages with maintained ATP levels, requiring p53-directed signals. PON1 promoted ROS deregulation protecting the mitochondria from dysregulation. PON1 knockdown resulted in the blockage of its antioxidant function in LC cells through Akt signaling with reduced invasive signature as a consequence of scant expression. Targeted glycolysis stimulated PON1 antioxidant activity regulating phosphorylation of AMPK-α. The functional data imply that exploitation of the antioxidative function of PON1 is consequential in driving LC pathogenesis at the cell-autonomous mechanistic level with consequences on tumor growth. © Aldonza et al.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, they also pose a significant threat in restricted zones. Radar can be used to detect and discriminate UAVs. Due to the low flying altitude of the UAVs, it is found that the radar signals also include some unwanted echoes, reflected by building, ground, trees and grasses etc. Consequently, it has not been possible to get the clean UAVs characteristics for further classification. In this paper, the MTI filter is applied to cancel the ground clutter and based this, an improved MTI filter is further proposed. Compared with the traditional MTI filter, the improved one significantly enhances ground clutter rejection capability while maintaining most of the target power. As the result, the cleaner UAVs classification characteristics can be obtained.

The proliferation and interconnection of networked devices and the ever-growing numbers of users able to damage (accidentally or deliberately) the integrity of this system of systems leads to cyber security adopting a reactive and defensive stance, in which we devise policy on the basis of what has happened, rather than what may happen, or what we pray will never happen. Simultaneously, the growth of the domain leads to silo thinking, and a lack of communication between public and private, civilian and military sectors; there is a need for a synoptic examination of the field, pooling the knowledge of practitioners from across the discipline. This paper will present the development of the initial proof of concept study, outlining: use of a blended methodology, combining automated quantitative analysis (via Corpus Linguistics tools) with qualitative study (via Critical Discourse Analysis); ethical issues involved in obtaining, storing, and handling of the data; a discussion of initial hypotheses; the intended plan of campaign for moving the project from pilot stage to its full scope; proposals as to how this project may act as a driver for innovation and greater resilience in devising effective cyber security policy. Mediaeval maps often contained blank space, labelled 'Terra Incognita' and 'Here Be Monsters'; this project will develop a more detailed cartography of the threat landscape of the cyber domain, filling in the blanks and identifying the 'monsters' we fear. This is an innovative project, examining empirical data drawn from respondents across the discipline, and offers a new way of examining the challenges we face. It allows us to develop a more accurate picture of the threat landscape, and to evaluate what risks we may be ignoring.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Methods Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out according to a unified protocol using Kirby-Bauer method and automated systems. Results A total of 5 524 nonduplicate clinical isolates were collected during 2015, including gram-negative bacteria (3 882, 70.3%), gram-positive bacteria (1 642, 29.7%). The prevalence of methicillin-resistant isolates in Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) was 57.6% and 83.0%, respectively. All staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid. E. faecalis and E. faecium accounted for 46.1% and 46.8% of enterococcal isolates. Some E. faecalis and E. faecium strains were nonsusceptible to vancomycin or linezolid. The prevalence of extended-spectrum lactamases (ESBLs) positive strains was 62.0% in E. coli, 32.2% in Klebsiella and 18.8% in Proteus mirabilis. Enterobacteriaceae strains were still highly susceptible to carbapenem antibiotics, evidenced by lower resistance rate of Enterobacteriaceae strains to ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem (all<22%). Conclusions It seems that antibiotic resistance still poses a serious threat to clinical antimicrobial therapy.

We trained a CNN from scratch on data produced by a Threat Image Projection (TIP) framework that generates images with realistic variation to robustify performance. The system achieved 90% detection of containers that contained a single SMT, while raising 6% false positives on benign containers. The best CNN architecture used the raw high energy image (single-energy) and its logarithm as input channels. Use of the logarithm improved performance, thus echoing studies on human operator performance. However, it is an unexpected result with CNNs. In this work, we (i) investigate methods to exploit material information captured in dual-energy images, and (ii) introduce a new CNN training scheme that generates â€spot-the-difference' benign and threat pairs on-the-fly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that CNNs have been applied directly to raw dual-energy X-ray imagery, in any field. To exploit dual-energy, we experiment with adapting several physics-derived approaches to material discrimination from the cargo literature, and introduce three novel variants. We hypothesise that CNNs can implicitly learn about the material characteristics of objects from the raw dual-energy images, and use this to suppress false positives. The best performing method is able to detect 95% of containers containing a single SMT, while raising 0.4% false positives on benign containers. This is a step change improvement in performance over our prior work. © 2017 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To decrease the explored deficiencies in the present system, applicable proposals are formulated about development areas, such as forming a communication between vehicular traffic and railed vehicles. We feel that such developments are important steps in increasing traffic safety, and we regard them as elements of intelligent transport. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"An approach to mitigate multiple malicious node black hole attacks on VANETs","2017","European Conference on Information Warfare and Security, ECCWS","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027984902&partnerID=40&md5=99dab90653b68e54a75dc68ad01b3ccf","Inter-vehicular communication is a growing trend among the motor vehicle industry, as part of the shift to the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) paradigm and the emergence of autonomous vehicles. The benefits of using vehicular communication systems are many: traffic congestion can be abated leading to increased route efficiency and fuel economy; road traffic accidents and fatalities can be prevented; and new services are made available to both driver and passengers. Due to the important functions carried out by these networks, it is essential that communication is secure and free from interference by malicious parties. But the very nature of these networks (i.e. public and dynamically forming, over a shared medium) make them susceptible to certain attack vectors. Black hole attacks are a discernible threat to vehicular communication and the availability of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). Previously, we proposed a solution to mitigate these attacks in the case of a single malicious node. This countermeasure comprised a detection, accusation, and blacklisting scheme. We now extend that work to also account for cases where multiple malicious nodes are present in the same network. For cases where there is only one malicious node on multiple routes, we add a recursive element to our algorithm to handle additional detections during the accusation phase. Routes containing a node with a pending accusation are also precluded from selection. Where multiple malicious nodes exist on the same route, we adapt our former strategy to allow for multiple concurrent accusations and to find alternate routes to non-malicious nodes that need to be queried when verifying an accusation. We provide validation for our proposal using a simulation model built in NS-3. Results from simulation show the efficacy of our solution in detecting and preventing multiple malicious node black hole attacks in VANETs.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The main hypothesis argues that informality in land tenure creates incentives to overexploit the wood resources through the omission or alteration of the institutions which regulate the forest harvesting. Thereby, in this paper it is estimated the relationship between forest harvesting in Antioquia and the property rights over land. Methodologically, this work incorporates a fixed effects panel data model, which allows temporal and longitudinal traceability of the wood exploitation in the producing municipalities of Antioquia. The results suggest that high levels of forest harvesting occur in municipalities with high informality in land tenure due to the difficulty of organizations to enforce regulations.

First of all, the IGC system model of the UCAV is built based on the three-channel independent design idea, which reduces the difficulties of designing the controller. Then, IGC control laws are designed using the trajectory linearization control (TLC). A nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is introduced to the IGC controller to reject various uncertainties, such as the aerodynamic parameter perturbation and the measurement error interference. The stability of the closed-loop system is proven by using the Lyapunov theorem. The performance of the proposed IGC design method is verified in a terminal attack mission of the suicide UCAV.

To study changes in course of arrhythmias, depending on the efficacy of coronary blood flow restoration due to pharmacoinvasive revascularization in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Material and methods. STEMI-patients (n=117) with an effective (according to ECG criteria) thrombolytic therapy (TLT) and the subsequent (after 3-24 hours) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), were included into the study. Telemetry ECG was performed before and after PCI with analysis of the arrhythmias and cardiac conduction disorders. Results. Patients (n=84; 71.8%) with an effective TLT, confirmed by the coronary angiography (CAG), and with subsequent effective PCI were included into the group ""without rethrombosis"" (RT(-)). Patients (n=33; 28.2%) with CAG proven rethrombosis of the infarct-related coronary artery and subsequent effective PCI were included into the group ""with rethrombosis"" (RT(+)). Regardless of the stability of coronary blood flow restoration after the TLT, PCI was associated with an increased incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) (p < 0.01), sinus tachycardia (p=0.01), paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) (p < 0.05) and paired ventricular extrasystoles (p < 0.01). Compared to the RT(-) group, in the RT(+) group after PCI VT were recorded more frequently (44% vs 63.6%, respectively; p < 0.05) as well as AV-block 3 degree (3.6% vs 12.1%, respectively; p < 0.05). Episodes of sinus tachycardia were detected significantly more frequently before PCI in RT(-) group compared with RT(+) group (67.9% vs 45.4% respectively; p < 0.01). The number of patients with episodes of sinus bradycardia increased (from 19% to 32.1%; p=0.02) after PCI in RT(-) group. Conclusion. The incidence of VT and SVT paroxysms, episodes of sinus tachycardia, atrioventricular conduction disturbances and ventricular extrasystoles increased in all patients after the effective PCI due to reperfusion. However, VT episodes and paroxysmal atrioventricular block grade 3 were more common in patients with previous re-thrombosis of the infarct-related coronary artery. Considering a high risk of arrhythmic events, continuous ECG mon itoring with automated alarm systems about life-threatening arrhythmias should be applied in STEMI patients regardless of tactics of coronary blood flow restoration and the reperfusion effectiveness.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Stable weakly dispersive modal pulses (SWDMPs) are special modal pulses that are characterized by weak dispersion and weak scattering-induced broadening and are thus suitable for communications applications. This paper investigates, using numerical simulations, receiver array requirements for recovering information carried by SWDMPs under various signal-to-noise ratio conditions without performing channel equalization. Two groups of weakly dispersive modal pulses are common in typical mid-latitude deep ocean environments: the lowest order modes (typically modes 1–3 at 75 Hz), and intermediate order modes whose waveguide invariant is near-zero (often around mode 20 at 75 Hz). Information loss is quantified by the bit error rate (BER) of a recovered binary phase-coded signal. With fixed receiver depths, low BERs (less than 1%) are achieved at ranges up to 400 km with three hydrophones for mode 1 with 90% probability and with 34 hydrophones for mode 20 with 80% probability. With optimal receiver depths, depending on propagation range, only a few, sometimes only two, hydrophones are often sufficient for low BERs, even with intermediate mode numbers. Full modal resolution is unnecessary to achieve low BERs. Thus, a flexible receiver array of autonomous vehicles can outperform a cabled array. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

It refers to the deployment of a swarm of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Ground Control Stations (GCS). These UAVs collaborate in order to relay data (command and control traffic and remotely sensed data) between each other and to the Ground Control Station (GCS). Compared to other types of ad hoc networks, UAANETs have some unique features and bring several major challenges to the research community. One of these is the design of UAANET routing protocol. It must establish an efficient route between UAVs and adjust in real time to the rapidly changing topology. It must also be secured to protect the integrity of the network against malicious attackers. Security of routing protocols has been widely investigated in wired networks and MANETs, but as far as we are aware, there is no previous research paper dealing with the security features of UAANET routing protocols.

A special linear precoding scheme is proposed to enable the SU to exploit the PU free eigenmodes. We analyze two scenarios in which the UAV relay gain matrix is either fixed or optimized. We derive the optimal power allocation that maximizes the achievable rate of the SU respecting power budget, interference, and relay power constraints. Numerical results highlight the cognitive rate gain of our proposed scheme with respect to various problem parameters. We also highlight the effect of UAV altitude on the SU and PU rates. Finally, when the relay matrix is optimized, we show that the PU rate is remarkably enhanced and that the SU rate is only improved at high-power regime. © 2013 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The attention mechanism is implemented by training an artificial agent to learn a search policy, which is then exploited during inference.

Therefore, how to detect the trajectories of targets from UAV aerial image sequences is of great importance. Because local features are suitable to detect target tracking, we exploit scaleinvariant feature transform (SIFT) features to describe the interesting keypoints of targets. The main innovation of this paper is to utilize Multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) algorithm to track an object (target) in a series of image sequences. Particularly, we develop a MHT framework based on a multidimensional assignment formulation and a sliding time window policy. To obtain target tracking from UAV aerial image sequences, three steps should be done, that is, 1) Breaking each track set into tracklet at a specific time, 2) Estimating the association cost of each track set, 3) Merging trajectory fragments to a longer one iteratively. Finally, we collect several UAV aerial image sequences with different target density to construct a dataset, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2017 L.

Therefore, using the data obtained from concentration-monitoring of the contaminant to find the source is of high importance. Most previous source estimation methods collect meteorological parameters and concentration measurements from static sensors. However, some meteorological parameters such as atmospheric stability and cloud cover are difficult to measure precisely. Furthermore, installing only several static sensors does not provide enough sampling data. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to find the location of an emission source as well as its release rate in a chemical industry park. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) monitoring platform is applied to sample sufficient and high-quality concentration data. Afterwards, an artificial neural network (ANN) trained by an atmospheric dispersion simulation tool is used to locate and quantify the emission source from candidate solutions, bypassing data on the atmospheric stability and other hard-to-obtain meteorological parameters. A numerical simulation with different conditions is implemented to test the accuracy and stability of the proposed approach. A real experiment is conducted in Shanghai to test the performance and sensitivity of this approach as well as the robustness of the monitoring platform. The results show that the approach proposed in this paper can effectively estimate the contaminant source in chemical industry parks.

Researchers have recently adopted trajectory optimization methods to achieve their goals. This study posits that trajectory optimization plays a key role in reducing aircraft emissions. Therefore, trajectory optimization reduces the cost of fuel consumption shouldered by the aviation industry. Noise-optimized routes are surveyed to protect the population from the effects of noise. These routes are studied to reduce traffic in environmentally sensitive zones and avoid collision resulting from the large number of aircraft systems in the air. Unless further measures are implemented to achieve significant changes in technology and operations, trajectory optimization will continue to be the preferred method of reducing the effects of aviation emissions on the environment. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

The CHEMSEA project explored the fact that the degradation products of CWA may be different in the environment than those predicted by theoretical chemistry. The project surveyed more than 1,500 sq. km of seafloor and conducted 220 ROV sampling/identification missions. Also in the Baltic region, the MODUM initiative (Toward the Monitoring of Dumped Munitions Threat), a project from 2013 to 2016 supported by NATO's Science for Peace and Security Programme, established a cost-effective monitoring network to observe munitions dump sites using research vessels, AUVs and ROVs. Funded by the EU, the recently launched project DAIMON (Decision aid for marine munitions) will be capitalizing on past projects, proposing a risk management tool so that decision makers can evaluate the risks and benefits of various options in selected case sites.","Review","Final","Scopus"

"Yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films via MOCVD for thermal barrier and protective applications in injection molding","2017","Key Engineering Materials","10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.742.427","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027227927&doi=10.4028%2fwww.scientific.net%2fKEM.742.427&partnerID=40&md5=adeec5eaba9a35e6d60cccd019c4d615","Steel tools, which are used in industrial high-throughput processes like injection molding, are susceptible for wear and corrosion due to rapid cyclic temperature and pressure fluctuation as well as the use of abrasive polymers. For the protection of tool surfaces high quality ceramic thin films can be applied by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). In addition to protective properties ceramic materials like yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) are able to thermally insulate tool surfaces providing a more precise temperature regulation with intent to avoid the formation of surface flaws, e.g. weld lines, in the later plastic parts. At the same time it enables the shortening of cycle times as well as the decrease of energy demands during the molding process. In this work we demonstrate the fabrication of zirconia based thin films and multilayer systems on steel tools with complex 3D surfaces via MOCVD using metal acetylacetonates as precursor materials. Coating development was carried out by measuring the film thicknesses at different parameter settings. The usage of autonomous liquid flow controllers enables the formation of multilayer systems as well as the control of crystallinity by addition of different dopants to the material. For process development substrates were engineered according to tool geometry containing typical cavities and defined cracks with aspect ratios up to 1:60. That application enables the proof of conformity and the verification of homogeneous film thickness distribution. Exploitation of these results offers the coating of tools, which are tested regarding their desired properties by industrial project partners under production conditions. © 2017 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Aircraft design optimization often narrowed to analysis of cruise conditions does not take into account other flight phases (manoeuvres). These, especially in unmanned air vehicle sector, can be significant part of the whole flight. Empennage is a part of the aircraft, with crucial function for manoeuvres. It is important to consider robustness for highest performance. Design/methodology/approach: Methodology for robust wing design is presented. Surrogate modelling using kriging is used to reduce the optimization cost for high-fidelity aerodynamic calculations. Analysis of varying flight conditions, angle of attack, is made to assess robustness of design for particular mission. Two cases are compared: global optimization of 11 parameters and optimization divided into two consecutive sub-optimizations. Findings: Surrogate modelling proves its usefulness for cutting computational time. Optimum design found by splitting problem into sub-optimizations finds better design at lower computational cost. Practical implications: It is demonstrated, how surrogate modelling can be used for analysis of robustness, and why it is important to consider it. Intuitive split of wing design into airfoil and planform sub-optimizations brings promising savings in the optimization cost. Originality/value: Methodology presented in this paper can be used in various optimization problems, especially those involving expensive computations and requiring top quality design. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Despite being the focus of environmental studies for decades, the benthic megafauna of the CCZ remain poorly known. In order to predict and manage the environmental impacts of mining in the CCZ, baseline knowledge of the megafauna is essential. The ABYSSLINE Project has conducted benthic biological baseline surveys in the UK Seabed Resources Ltd polymetallic-nodule exploration contract area (UK-1). Prior to these research cruises in 2013 and 2015, no biological studies had been done in this area of the eastern CCZ. New information Using a Remotely Operated Vehicle and Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, the megafauna within the UKSRL exploration contract area (UK-1) and at a site ~250 km east of the UK-1 area were surveyed, allowing us to make the first estimates of megafaunal morphospecies richness from the imagery collected. Here, we present an atlas of the abyssal echinoderm megafauna observed and collected during the ABYSSLINE cruises to the UK-1 polymetallic-nodule exploration contract area in the CCZ. There appear to be at least 62 distinct morphospecies (13 Asteroidea, 5 Crinoidea, 9 Echinoidea, 29 Holothuroidea and 6 Ophiuroidea) identified mostly by imagery but also using molecular barcoding for a limited number of animals that were collected. This atlas will aid the synthesis of megafaunal presence/absence data collected by contractors, scientists and other stakeholders undertaking work in the CCZ, ultimately helping to decipher the biogeography of the megafauna in this threatened habitat. © Amon D et al.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The principle of self-help and the act of organising to provide mutual benefits have strong traditions in the labour movement. Westfund was a health fund established in 1953 by the Western District Branch of the Miners' Federation in Lithgow New South Wales, largely to provide medical benefits to miners. Organised labour historically has also campaigned for state provision of welfare services. In Australia, the notion of ""Labourism"" refers to a particular approach adopted by organised labour whereby they represented their interests directly in the political sphere through the Australian Labor Party. When the labour movement achieved its aim of a more universal health care system under the Whitlam ALP government, Westfund chose to work within the system in order to survive. Mutualism and labourism co-existed. The subsequent introduction of Medicare by the Hawke ALP government brought changes which created a more threatening business environment for health funds. In this instance to mitigate the danger it posed to their business, Westfund chose to oppose more aggressively aspects of the universal health system. Westfund weakened its institutional ties to the labour movement, and became more autonomous from its roots as a mutual. © 2017 Australian Society for the Study of Labour History.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Also, while the Federal Aviation Administration NextGen project aims to integrate civilian drones into the national airspace, the regulation is still a work-in-progress and does not cope with their threats. This article surveys the main security, privacy, and safety aspects associated with the use of civilian drones in the national airspace. In particular, we identify both the physical and cyber threats of such systems and discuss the security properties required by their critical operation environment.We also identify the research challenges and possible future directions in the fields of civilian drone security, safety, and privacy.

This paper deals with the prediction of pressure and velocity fields on a UAV with internal propulsion system using computational fluid dynamics. The main objective is to evaluate the effect of the air flow past the aircraft and how this affects the aerodynamic performance by means of obtaining lift and drag forces. The airfoil of this aircraft is the 2415-3S, which was developed in previous research [1]. Since the computational domain is three-dimensional and complex, a hybrid mesh was developed and validated with a convergence study. Both the computational domain and the numerical solution were developed with commercial CAD and CFD software respectively. Air, incompressible and steady was simulated with a Reynolds number of 2.74 x 105. The selected turbulence model was Spalart-Allmaras which has been designed specifically for aerospace applications involving wall-bounded flows. Lift, drag and moment coefficients as well as pressure and velocity contours were obtained at different angles of attack. Experimental results will be obtained in future work to be compared to numerical ones and achieve the validation. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Within RTSP, it is essential to meet the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) in all flight phases, especially considering the Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) evolutions in the UAS Traffic Management (UTM) context. However, in dense urban environments characterized by tall buildings and complex structural variations, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is prone to data degradations or complete loss of signal due to multipath effects, interference or antenna obscuration. Furthermore, there is always a risk of jamming and spoofing of GNSS signals, with low cost civilian GNSS receivers being more vulnerable to a spoof attack. Therefore, a number of Signals of Opportunity (SoOP) techniques are explored to improve the RNP when Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are employed in urban canyons. Electromagnetic signals found in urban environment including analogue/ digital radio, analogue/digital television, Wi-Fi, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) based signals are considered to model the system performance parameters. Implementation methods for using Signals of Opportunity such as Angle of Arrival (AOA), Time of Arrival (TOA), Received Signal Strength (RSS) and Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) are modeled and compared. Integration of SoOP techniques in novel low-cost Navigation and Guidance Systems (NGS) is also investigated. As SoOP were not initially designed for navigation purposes, no single source of SoOP for navigation can work in all environments and hence a SoOP source has to be selected based on specific requirements in the considered urban environment. Constraints of power and weight on the UAV besides hardware and software costs are also factors that are considered when selecting appropriate SoOP signal sources. Hence, there is a clear opportunity to provide considerable savings in both infrastructure as well as energy costs and thus providing a low-cost and low-volume integrated NGS for trusted aerial autonomous operations. © 2017 The Authors.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This paper presents an automatic, subject adaptive framework for accurate face detection in the long infrared spectrum on our database for oral cancer detection consisting of malignant, precancerous and normal subjects of varied age group. Previous works on oral cancer detection using Digital Infrared Thermal Imaging(DITI) reveals that patients and normal subjects differ significantly in their facial thermal distribution. Therefore, it is a challenging task to formulate a completely adaptive framework to veraciously localize face from such a subject specific modality. Our model consists of first extracting the most probable facial regions by minimum error thresholding followed by ingenious adaptive methods to leverage the horizontal and vertical projections of the segmented thermal image. Additionally, the model incorporates our domain knowledge of exploiting temperature difference between strategic locations of the face. To our best knowledge, this is the pioneering work on detecting faces in thermal facial images comprising both patients and normal subjects. Previous works on face detection have not specifically targeted automated medical diagnosis; face bounding box returned by those algorithms are thus loose and not apt for further medical automation. Our algorithm significantly outperforms contemporary face detection algorithms in terms of commonly used metrics for evaluating face detection accuracy. Since our method has been tested on challenging dataset consisting of both patients and normal subjects of diverse age groups, it can be seamlessly adapted in any DITI guided facial healthcare or biometric applications. © 2017 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Methods Clinical isolates were collected from Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from January l to December 31, 2015. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out according to a unified protocol using Kirby-Bauer method or automated systems. Results were analyzed according to CLSI 2015 breakpoints. Results A total of 13 109 clinical isolates were collected from January to December 2015, of which gram negative organisms and gram positive cocci accounted for 65.3% (8 560/13 109) and 34.7% (4 549/13 109), respectively. Methicillinresistant strains in S. aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) accounted for 29.6% and 67.1%, respectively. Most (93.1%) MRSA strains were still susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, while 80.2% of MRCNS strains were susceptible to rifampin. No staphylococcal strains were found resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin or linezolid. The resistance rates of E. faecalis strains to most antibiotics tested (except tetracycline) were much lower than those of E. faecium. Some strains of both species were resistant to vancomycin. No E. faecalis or E. faecium strains were found resistant to vancomycin. The prevalence of ESBLs-producing strains was 55.7% in E. coli and 43.5% in Klebsiella (K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca) and 11.6% in Proteus mirabilis isolates. ESBLs-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains were more resistant than non-ESBLs-producing strains in terms of antibiotic resistance rates. Enterobacteriaceae strains were still highly susceptible to carbapenems. Overall, less than 16.0% of these strains were resistant to carbapenems. About 10.5% and 9.4% of the A. baumannii strains were resistant to imipenem and meropenem, respectively. Compared to the data of year 2014, the prevalence of extensively-drug resistant P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae strains increased. Conclusions The antibiotic resistance of clinical bacterial isolates is growing. The emerging and increasing prevalence of multi-drug or pan-drug resistant strains poses a serious threat to clinical practice and implies the importance of strengthening infection control. © Editorial Department of Chinese Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Over the previous decades, space agency efforts have brought forth well-known and immensely useful satellites such as the Landsat series and the Gravity Research and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system, with costs typically of the order of 1 billion dollars per satellite and with concept-to-launch timelines of the order of 2 decades (for new missions). More recently, the proliferation of smartphones has helped to miniaturize sensors and energy requirements, facilitating advances in the use of CubeSats that can be launched by the dozens, while providing ultra-high (3- 5 m) resolution sensing of the Earth on a daily basis. Startup companies that did not exist a decade ago now operate more satellites in orbit than any space agency, and at costs that are a mere fraction of traditional satellite missions. With these advances come new space-borne measurements, such as real-time high-definition video for tracking air pollution, storm-cell development, flood propagation, precipitation monitoring, or even for constructing digital surfaces using structure-from-motion techniques. Closer to the surface, measurements from small unmanned drones and tethered balloons have mapped snow depths, floods, and estimated evaporation at sub-metre resolutions, pushing back on spatio-temporal constraints and delivering new process insights. At ground level, precipitation has been measured using signal attenuation between antennae mounted on cell phone towers, while the proliferation of mobile devices has enabled citizen scientists to catalogue photos of environmental conditions, estimate daily average temperatures from battery state, and sense other hydrologically important variables such as channel depths using commercially available wireless devices. Global internet access is being pursued via highaltitude balloons, solar planes, and hundreds of planned satellite launches, providing a means to exploit the ""internet of things"" as an entirely new measurement domain. Such global access will enable real-time collection of data from billions of smartphones or from remote research platforms. This future will produce petabytes of data that can only be accessed via cloud storage and will require new analytical approaches to interpret. The extent to which today's hydrologic models can usefully ingest such massive data volumes is unclear. Nor is it clear whether this deluge of data will be usefully exploited, either because the measurements are superfluous, inconsistent, not accurate enough, or simply because we lack the capacity to process and analyse them. What is apparent is that the tools and techniques afforded by this array of novel and game-changing sensing platforms present our community with a unique opportunity to develop new insights that advance fundamental aspects of the hydrological sciences. To accomplish this will require more than just an application of the technology: in some cases, it will demand a radical rethink on how we utilize and exploit these new observing systems. © Author(s) 2017.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, there are a number of conditions which need to be met if such solutions are to be adequately integrated into existing health systems; we consider these from regulatory, technological and user perspectives. We explore the need for an appropriate legislative and regulatory framework, to avoid 'work around' solutions, which threaten patient confidentiality (such as the extensive use of instant messaging services to deliver sensitive clinical information and seek diagnostic and management advice). In addition, we will look at other confidentiality issues such as the need for applications to remove identifiable information (such as photos) from users' devices. Integration is dependent upon multiple technological factors, and we illustrate these using examples such as products made available specifically for adoption in low- and middle-income countries. Issues such as usability of the application, signal loss, data volume utilization, need to enter passwords, and the availability of automated or in-app contextrelevant clinical advice will be discussed. From a user perspective, there are three groups to consider: experts, front-line clinicians, and patients. Each will accept, to different degrees, the use of technology in care - often with cultural or regional variation - and this is central to integration and uptake.

Besides the loads they may carry, autonomous systems are also valuable property, and self-preservation mechanisms are needed to protect them in the presence of external threats, including malicious robots and antagonistic humans. We present a biologically inspired risk-based triggering mechanism to initiate self-preservation strategies. This mechanism considers environmental and internal system factors to measure the overall risk at any moment in time, to decide whether behaviours such as fleeing or hiding are necessary, or whether the system should continue on its task. We integrated our risk-based triggering mechanism into a delivery rover that is being attacked by a drone and evaluated its effectiveness through systematic testing in a simulated environment in Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo, with a variety of different randomly generated conditions. We compared the use of the triggering mechanism and different configurations of self-preservation behaviours to not having any of these. Our results show that triggering self-preservation increases the distance between the drone and the rover for many of these configurations, and, in some instances, the drone does not catch up with the rover. Our study demonstrates the benefits of embedding risk awareness and self-preservation into autonomous systems to increase their robustness, and the value of using bio-inspired engineering to find solutions in this area. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

There have been many civilian counter-drone solutions and products reported, including radar and electromagnetic counter measures. For the current electromagnetic solutions, they are usually limited to particular type of detection and counter-measure scheme, which is usually effective for the specific type of drones. Also, control and communication link technologies used in even RC drones nowadays are more sophisticated, making them more difficult to detect, decode and counter. Facing these challenges, our team proposes a ""software-defined"" solution based on noise and LPI radar. For the detection, wideband-noise radar has the resolution performance to discriminate possible micro-Doppler features of the drone versus biological scatterers. It also has the benefit of more adaptive to different types of drones, and covertly detecting for security application. For counter-measures, random noise can be combined with ""random sweeping"" jamming scheme, to achieve the optimal balance between peak power allowed and the effective jamming probabilities. Some theoretical analysis of the proposed solution is provided in this study, a design case study is developed, and initial laboratory experiments, as well as outdoor tests are conducted to validate the basic concepts and theories. The study demonstrates the basic feasibilities of the Drone Detection and Mitigation Radar (DDMR) concept, while there are still much work needs to be done for a complete and field-worthy technology development. © 2017 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

UAVs are much smaller than manned aircrafts and do not risk the pilot's life, which makes UAVs more versatile and costeffective than regular aircrafts. However, UAVs are at risk when encountering unexpected events, such as control disruptions from intentional attacks. This raises securityand safety-related issues for the use of UAVs. To deal with such issues, this paper proposes a UAV control system that uses machine-learning technology to detect anomalies. The proposed system provides analytical redundancy by analyzing numerical data based on mathematical models. Machine learning generally requires large amounts of data to produce meaningful outcomes, and the proposed UAV control system meets these requirements since it has the ability to collect large amounts of data from UAVs. Two types of flight circumstances were simulated in an experiment. One involved the security of the UAV control system, and the other involved the safety of the UAV itself. A real-time anomaly detection system for the proposed UAV control system is also introduced and experimental results are described in detail.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In addition, a set of different techniques has been integrated into multiagent applications. However, few of these applications have been commercially deployed and few of these techniques have been fully exploited by industrial applications. One reason is the lack of procedures guaranteeing that multiagent systems would behave as desired. Most of the existing test approaches only test agents as single individuals and do not provide ways of inspecting the behavior of an agent as part of a group, and the behavior of the whole group of agents. Accordingly, we modeled and developed a publishsubscribe- based architecture to facilitate the implementation of systems to test MASs at the agent and group levels. To illustrate and evaluate the use of the proposed architecture, we developed an MAS-based application and performed functional and performance ad-hoc tests.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In particular, the exposure to prolonged vibration is a potential cause of pathologies such as the hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), therefore national and international regulations establish recommended limits to the workers' exposure to vibration within an allowable daily limit. However, evaluating the maximum allowable operating time is not straightforward, therefore reference vibration values are provided by the manufacturer. These values are frequently unreliable, since the effective vibration intensity generated by mechanical machines largely depends upon several specific factors such as maintenance, operating conditions, etc. A more effective approach would rather involve equipping the worker with suitable instruments to monitor and analyse in real time the vibration exposure. This is particularly difficult in open-field operations as mechanical harvesting, where wireless sensing and communicating technologies can be effectively employed in general framework of the Internet of Things (IoT) to develop small monitoring devices at affordable cost. In such context, the present research proposes an innovative system aimed at estimating the hand-arm exposure to vibration according to the Standard EN ISO 5349-1:2004. In particular, the proposed system is based on a referenced monitoring system, based on the employment of a compact wearable unit to be attached to the waist of the operator and a fixed station for data storage and analysis. The paper describes how this information can be exploited in a decision context to effectively schedule the working shifts for a team of workers in high exposure operations such as olive harvesting with mechanical shakers.

However, the adoption of flow-based biochips is hampered today by the lack of computer-aided design tools. Manual design procedures not only delay product development but they also inhibit the exploitation of the design complexity that is possible with current fabrication techniques. In this paper, we present the first practical problem formulation for automated control-layer design in flow-based microfluidic very large-scale integration (mVLSI) biochips and propose a systematic approach for solving this problem. Our goal is to find an efficient routing solution for control-layer design with a minimum number of control pins. The pressure-propagation delay, an intrinsic physical phenomenon in mVLSI biochips, is minimized in order to reduce the response time for valves, decrease the pattern set-up time, and synchronize valve actuation. Two fabricated flow-based devices and six synthetic benchmarks are used to evaluate the proposed optimization method. Compared with manual control-layer design and a baseline approach, the proposed approach leads to fewer control pins, better timing behavior, and shorter channel length in the control layer. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Our stereoscope is sky-facing with 360° × 180° fisheye cameras to observe surrounding obstacles. We propose a 3D modelling and plane extraction through following steps: stereoscope self-calibration for decalibration robustness, stereo matching considering neighbours epipolar curves to compute 3D, and robust plane fitting based on generated cartography and Hough transform. We use these 3D data with GPS raw data to estimate NLOS (Non Line Of Sight) reflected signals pseudorange delay. We exploit extracted planes to build a visibility mask for NLOS detection. A simplified 3D canyon model allows to compute reflections pseudorange delays. In the end, GPS positioning is computed considering corrected pseudoranges. With experimentations on real fixed scenes, we show generated 3D models reaching metric accuracy and improvement of horizontal GPS positioning accuracy by more than 50%.

Placing strikes within the context of the theorized political functions of force and considering how they fit into two grand strategies, restraint and selective engagement, I argue that these strikes buy the United States relatively little in the way of political effects assuring its own security because the terrorism threat they are intended to combat is a limited one within the skein of US global interests. Furthermore, their contribution to counter-terrorism efforts is likely to diminish with the adoption of armed drones by non-state actors. Drone strikes can, however, provide leverage over recalcitrant US client states while reassuring liberal partners and giving them some leverage over US choices. In addition, within the counter-terrorism sphere, drone strikes are less likely to inflame popular opinion than are alternative uses of force. This analysis contributes to an increasingly rigorous examination of the strikes’ role in US foreign and security policy. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Then, we review developments in propulsion and power supply systems and their control strategies, to subsequently discuss opportunities and challenges for these systems and the associated control.

The following problem is considered. Multiple autonomous vehicles (AVs) with access to global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals are aiding their on-board INSs with GNSS pseudoranges. While navigating, AV-mounted receivers draw pseudorange observations on ambient unknown terrestrial SOPs and collaboratively estimate the SOPs' states. After some time, GNSS signals become unavailable. Subsequently, the AVs exploit the SOPs to collaboratively aid their INSs. A collaborative estimation framework which uses time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements taken with reference to a specific SOP is presented. This framework is studied over varying the quantity of collaborating AVs, and it is demonstrated that ""GNSS-like"" performance can be achieved in the absence of GNSS signals.

Commonly, they are jointly used to improve perception accuracy by simultaneously recording the distances of surrounding objects, as well as the color and shape information. In this paper, we use the correspondence between a 3-D LiDAR scanner and a CCD camera to rearrange the captured LiDAR point cloud into a dense depth map, in which each 3-D point corresponds to a pixel at the same location in the RGB image. In this paper, we assume that the LiDAR scanner and the CCD camera are accurately calibrated and synchronized beforehand so that each 3-D LiDAR point cloud is aligned with its corresponding RGB image. Each frame of the LiDAR point cloud is then projected onto the RGB image plane to form a sparse depth map. Then, a self-Adaptive method is proposed to upsample the sparse depth map into a dense depth map, in which the RGB image and the anisotropic diffusion tensor are exploited to guide upsampling by reinforcing the RGB-depth compactness. Finally, convex optimization is applied on the dense depth map for global enhancement. Experiments on the KITTI and Middlebury data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several other relevant state-of-The-Art methods in terms of visual comparison and root-mean-square error measurement. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

As a consequence of its conservation status, human activities are restricted in most of its remaining habitats. One sub-population of the capercaillie is located in the Entlebuch UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. The margins of one of its territories are increasingly used by snowshoe hikers and ski tourers at the capercaillie's most vulnerable time, during winter. In order to identify and monitor possible interferences, we tested whether drones can help to detect snowshoe and ski tourer tracks in the winter landscape and whether there is any reaction of wildlife to the drones. Results indicate that certain environmental conditions are needed to carry out accurate drone flights, but that with optimal technical and aeronautical settings, it is possible to gain aerial images that allow winter activities by humans to be identified, and even quantified. No disturbances to wildlife were identified. The findings indicate that drones can be used as a low-cost monitoring tool for detecting human winter activities in remote places, which represent a fast-growing threat to wildlife in mountain areas.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Persistent activation of the HPA axis can lead to impaired physiological or behavioral function with maladaptive consequences. Thus, efficient control and termination of stress responses is essential for well-being. However, inhibitory control mechanisms governing the HPA axis are poorly understood. Previous studies suggest that serotonergic systems, acting within the medial hypothalamus, play an important role in inhibitory control of stress-induced HPA axis activity. To test this hypothesis, we surgically implanted chronic jugular cannulae in adult male rats and conducted bilateral microinjection of vehicle or the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT; 8 nmol, 0.2 μL, 0.1 μL/min, per side) into the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) immediately prior to a 40 min period of restraint stress. Repeated blood sampling was conducted using an automated blood sampling system and plasma corticosterone concentrations were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bilateral intra-DMH microinjections of 8-OH-DPAT suppressed stress-induced increases in plasma corticosterone within 10 min of the onset of handling prior to restraint and, as measured by area-under-the-curve analysis of plasma corticosterone concentrations, during the 40 min period of restraint. These data support an inhibitory role for serotonergic systems, acting within the DMH, on stress-induced activation of the HPA axis. Lay summary: Inhibitory control of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) stress hormone response is important for well-being. One neurochemical implicated in inhibitory control of the HPA axis is serotonin. In this study we show that activation of serotonin receptors, specifically inhibitory 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsomedial hypothalamus, is sufficient to inhibit stress-induced HPA axis activity in rats. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","Scopus"

When considering vertical lift UAVs, differing payloads and rotor attachment geometries have a significant effect on the vehicle dynamic response during takeoff and stabilization. With no prior knowledge of payload parameters or rotor attachment geometry, there is no inherent flightworthiness guarantee for a specific connected configuration. On-ground flightworthiness determination can be used to ensure acceptable performance during the vehicle take-off or to prescribe changes to the rotor attachment geometry if necessary. This paper introduces an algorithm to determine flightworthiness while in ground contact by exploiting the relationship between the equivalent thrust vector and the mass center location. The algorithm utilizes a probabilistic estimate of rotor location derived through a Bayesian learning technique to maximize the amount of information gained from a subsequent deterministic rotor classification algorithm. Following a description of the algorithm, simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the algorithm for a variety of modular aircraft configurations. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In this paper, we study the low Reynolds number aerodynamic characteristics and flight mechanics of the near space solar unmanned aerial vehicle. The Results show that the lift drag ratio distribution has lager projection dispersion degree at the conditions of low Reynolds number. And the low Reynolds number flow has strong unsteady effects on the wing lift. The classical laminar separation bubble is the results of time average, which causes the low efficiency of the wing aerodynamics. And a new flow structure, the airfoil trailing edge laminar separation bubble, is discovered firstly, which reveals the aerodynamic nonlinear characteristics at small angle of attack at low Reynolds number.

The concept of error-cancelling balanced reactions is used to calculate a distribution of possible values for the standard enthalpy of formation of each species. The method automates the identification and exclusion of inconsistent data. We find that this enables the rapid convergence of the calculations towards chemical accuracy.

The data stored on the server can range from organizational information such as confidential customer related documents, project details, corporation's software source code to private media information, personal data, national security related information, patients database, question papers of the competitive exams etc. If such sensitive data gets in to wrong hands, it can be misused.Thus the business and the reputation of the organization would beat stake.

The lift and the drag coefficients were estimated using different codes and software such as ANSYS Fluent, USAF Datcom, XFLR5 and Tornado. These methods use a set of wing geometry parameters such as the wing span, the root and the tip chords, the leading edge angle and also the airfoil shape for each section of the wing as inputs in order to predict the wing aerodynamic coefficients. Computations were made for different cruise flight regimes in terms of altitudes (5,000 ft and 10,000 ft) and airspeeds (45 knots and 50 knots), and for a range of angles of attack from -2º to 10º. The lift and drag aerodynamic coefficients were next compared in order to highlight the similarities and the advantages of each methodology. In general, the results obtained shown that the aerodynamic coefficients computed with Tornado are really close to those computed with ANSYS Fluent. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This has been shown to be a threat to cryptographic software whose execution flow depends on the processed secrets. Testing implementations for these dependencies, or leaks, is essential to develop protected cryptographic software. In this work, we present an automated testing methodology that allows to detect execution flow leaks in implementations of modular exponentiation, a key operation in schemes like RSA, ElGamal, and Diffie-Hellman. We propose a simple and effective leakage test that captures problematic properties of vulnerable exponentiation algorithms. The execution flow of an implementation is directly monitored during exponentiation using a dynamic binary instrumentation framework. This allows to efficiently detect leaking code with instruction-level granularity in a noiseless and controlled environment. As a practical demonstration, we test multiple RSA implementations of modern cryptographic libraries with the proposed methodology. It reliably detects leaking code in vulnerable implementations and also identifies leaks in a protected implementation that are non-trivial to spot in a code review. We present a fix for these leaks and strongly recommend to also patch the other implementations. Because instruction cache attacks have been shown to be a threat in practice, it seems advisable to integrate an automated leakage test in the software release process of cryptographic libraries. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Findings - In portions of flight, aircraft's stability and control derivatives were unstable and nonlinear functions of airflow angles and angular rates. The roll angle had an important effect on unsteadiness of directional oscillatory damping derivatives. The pilot-induced oscillation and wing rock possibilities were investigated and dismissed so that the lateral directional oscillatory motion was classified as a nonlinear Dutch roll oscillation.

Several user authentication schemes are proposed in the literature. However, most of them are either vulnerable to different known attacks or they are inefficient. Recently, Althobaiti et al. presented a biometric-based user authentication scheme for WSNs. Although their scheme is efficient in computation, in this paper, we first show that their scheme has several security pitfalls such as (i) it is not resilient against node capture attack; (ii) it is insecure against impersonation attack; and (iii) it is insecure against man-in-the-middle attack. We then aim to propose a novel biometric-based user authentication scheme suitable for WSNs in order to withstand the security pitfalls found in Althobaiti et al. scheme.

The interaction between an ingested object and the propulsion system can jeopardize safety. For modern engines using composite fan blades with advanced aerodynamic geometry, this damage can potentially be elevated, since composite materials are generally more brittle than metal alloys used in the aerospace industry. Furthermore, the post impact residual strength of composite materials is often not substantial enough to endure the continuous rotation after severe impacts. Currently, the industry is faced with a new threat, rogue unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), routed in their widespread and exploding usage in professional and recreational capacities. Thus far, FOI research to guide propulsion design and certification processes has focused on either bird or ice ingestion. Due to yet to be explored dangers posed by UAS, the present work attempts to investigate the extent of any potential damage. Emphasis is placed on the detailed analysis of structural response and damage mechanics of a high-bypass turbojet engine subject to drone ingestion. The simulation results are compared with numerical bird ingestions to draw parallels and investigate the applicability of the existing bird ingestion regulations to drone ingestion scenarios.

Early detection and treatment of this CAD condition is essential and may help in preventing it from progressing further. However, faster and accurate identification of CAD from Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using manual interpretations is not an easy task to achieve. Thus, computer-aided techniques are necessary for the automated characterization of CAD condition. Therefore, this work proposes application of Higher-Order Statistics and Spectra (HOS) for an automated classification of normal and CAD conditions using ECG signals. In this paper, 182,013 beats (137,587 normal beats and 44,426 beats with CAD) ECG beats are used. HOS bispectrum and cumulant features are extracted from each ECG beat. The features extracted are applied to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) dimension reduction technique. Then PCA coefficients are ranked using Bhattacharyya method, entropy, fuzzy Max-Relevancy and Min-Redundancy (mRMR), Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC), t-test, Wilcoxon ranking methods. All ranked features are subjected to k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers to obtain the highest classification performance. The proposed methodology has achieved 98.17% accuracy, 94.57% sensitivity, and 99.34% specificity, using KNN classifier using 13 bispectrum features. Similarly, we have obtained 98.99% average accuracy, 97.75% sensitivity, and 99.39% specificity using DT classifier with 31 cumulant features.

In order to obtain a chaotic mobile robot, the chaotic signals are used to generate True RNGs (TRNGs), which, as is known, exploit the nondeterministic nature of chaotic controllers. Then, the bits obtained from TRNGs can be continuously mapped to coordinates (xn, yn) for positioning the robot on the terrain. A frequent technique to obtain a chaotic bitstream is to sample analog chaotic signals by using thresholds. However, the performance of chaotic path planning is a function of optimal values for those levels. In this framework, several chaotic systems which are used to obtain TRNGs but by computing a quasi-optimal performance surface for the thresholds is presented. The proposed study is based on sweeping the Poincaré sections to find quasi-optimal values for thresholds where the coverage rate is higher than those obtained by using the equilibrium points as reference values. Various scenarios are evaluated. First, two scroll chaotic systems such as Chua’s circuit, saturated function, and Lorenz are used as entropy sources to obtain TRNGS by using its computed performance surface. Afterwards, n-scrolls chaotic systems are evaluated to get chaotic bitstreams with the analyzed performance surface. Another scenario is dedicated to find the performance surface of hybrid chaotic systems, which are composed by three chaotic systems where one chaotic system determines which one of the remaining chaotic signals will be used to obtain the chaotic bitstream. Additionally, TRNGs from two chaotic systems with optimized Lyapunov exponents are studied. Several numerical simulations to compute diverse metrics such as coverage rate against planned points, robot’s trajectory evolution, covered terrain, and color map are carried out to analyze the resulting TRNGs. This investigation will enable to increase several applications of TRNGs by considering the proposed performance surfaces. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It involves distance-based comparison methods and the exploitation of information produced by a social network identification process for use as external knowledge towards searches on other social networks; thus, the remaining identification tasks for the same individual are optimized. The experimental study shows that, even with limited resources, the proposed method collects and combines accurate information effectively from different online sources in a fully-automated way.

Photographic Identification Method (PIM) has obtained favorable opinions, being effective and less intrusive with respect to traditional marking procedures. Here, we developed and tested the efficacy of a software-aided PIM based on different characteristics, which act as natural marks. Target species were the northern spectacled salamander (Salamandrina perspicillata, Amphibia: Urodela) and the stag beetle (Lucanus cervus, Coleoptera: Lucanidae). We considered as natural mark the ventral pattern of S. perspicillata and, for the first time in L. cervus, the presence/number of small denticles on male mandibles. We selected 4 independent characteristics, each one with several states, for each species. We asked participants, with different degree of familiarity with the species, to identify recaptured individuals through manual PIM. To assess the advantages of the software, we compared the time spent by experts of the species to identify an individual through manual PIM and software-aided PIM. We further compared our semi-automated method with a fully automated one. The software efficiency was calculated by increasing the number of characteristics used to filter individuals from the database (from 1 to 4). The chosen characteristics proved their reliability for individual identification and can be used as natural marks. The proposed software-aided PIM shorten the identification time, does not led to mismatching errors and proved its efficacy regardless of the taxa/characteristic used. Thus, this tool can be consider a more practical alternative to conventional marking techniques, in particular for sensitive and threatened species that need quick and effective monitoring programs carried out with non-invasive sampling © 2016 Elsevier GmbH","Article","Final","Scopus"

SDRs combine the flexible nature of software along with reconfigurable RF hardware to offer designers an expanded toolbox in which to develop, evaluate, and deploy their systems in a rapidly evolving spectral landscape. As is often the case, having a flexible system introduces possible security flaws. These security flaws become relevant when SDRs are embedded into real systems. Software-defined radars have been developed by defense contractors and may be poised to become the standard in a wide array of applications related to autonomous land, water, and air vehicles. However, no current work explores the security of a software-defined radar architecture. In this work, we examine example cyber attacks on small scale software-defined radar. The radar is composed of GNU Radio, a Linux framework for interacting with SDR hardware, and the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) N210, a reconfigurable RF frontend developed by Ettus Research. First we describe the operation of system from the GNU Radio software down to the packet format. This system analysis reveals that the communication channel within the radar is vulnerable to cyber attack. Specifically, it is possible to conduct Man-Inthe-Middle (MITM) attacks between GNU Radio and the USRP to alter the operation of the radar. The MITM attacks alter the hardware configuration and data used by the USRP, creating measurable effects in the distance estimates produced by the radar. We quantify these attacks by comparing the radar position estimates before and during an attack. The first MITM attack modifies hardware settings on the USRP. We observe up to a 76% error in the distance estimate by modifying the hardware configuration commands. We then create a targeted attack by modifying the RF data packets GNU Radio sends to the USRP. We show that intelligently altering the RF packet data introduces a targeted arbitrary distance offset into the radar range estimation with less than 10% error. We conclude with suggestions on how to secure a software-defined radar system assuming a similar structure to the test bed architecture.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This paper reports on computational investigation of the ever increasing risk of a mid-air ingestion of multirotor UAS into an aerodynamically advanced, high-bypass propulsion system. A survey of 150 commercially available multirotor drones was performed to characterize average UAS models that are representative of the contemporary multirotor UAS market. From this survey, two drone sizes were identified, based on statistically representative models for both the hobby and professional drone classifications. Using the generalized drone models, a parametric study was performed, investigating systems incorporating wide-chord fan blade designs with both carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and titanium fan blades. Through the analysis, the risk level posed by different classes of UAS on the high-bypass commercial jet engine is quantitatively determined.

Several authors have put forward various authentication protocols for multi-server environment during the past decade. Wang et al. recently proposed a biometric-based authentication with key agreement protocol for multi-server environment and claimed that their protocol is efficient and resistant to prominent security attacks. The careful investigation of this paper shows that Wang et al. protocol's users are sharing personal identifiable information with the application servers during the registration and authentication process. This nature of disclosing credentials leads to severe threats particularly insider attacks, user impersonation attacks, and server impersonation attacks. As a remedy of the aforementioned problems, this paper proposes a novel biometric-based mutually authenticated key agreement protocols for multi-server architecture based on elliptic curve cryptography. We prove that the proposed protocol achieves secure mutual authentication property using the broadly used Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic.

Therefore, regular safety inspections are necessary to ensure the safe operation of power grids. Tall vegetation and buildings are the key factors threatening the safe operation of extra high voltage transmission lines within a power line corridor. Manual or laser intensity direction and ranging (LiDAR) based inspections are time consuming and expensive. To make safety inspections more efficient and flexible, a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote-sensing platform, equipped with an optical digital camera, was used to inspect power line corridors. We propose a semi-patch matching algorithm based on epipolar constraints, using both the correlation coefficient (CC) and the shape of its curve to extract three dimensional (3D) point clouds for a power line corridor. We use a stereo image pair from inter-strip to improve power line measurement accuracy by transforming the power line direction to an approximately perpendicular to epipolar line. The distance between the power lines and the 3D point cloud is taken as a criterion for locating obstacles within the power line corridor automatically. Experimental results show that our proposed method is a reliable, cost effective, and applicable way for practical power line inspection and can locate obstacles within the power line corridor with accuracy better than ±0.5 m.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Our goal was to examine the hypothesis that during prelaying visits, cowbird females form a dynamic memory library of laying opportunities, which they deploy to target suitable nests at a later predawn period. We recorded presence of radio-tagged females within a fixed area around nests of chalked-browed mockingbirds, Mimus saturninus (a common host of shiny cowbirds), and baywings, Agelaioides badius (the main host of screaming cowbirds), using proximity data loggers placed at nests during prelaying, laying and early incubation. Our data confirmed that females of both species visit potential host nests prior to laying and that parasitic events occurred before dawn, earlier in screaming than shiny cowbirds but with little chance of host nests having been discovered on the laying day. There were interesting species differences: visits were less frequent in shiny than screaming cowbirds and the former rarely returned after laying, while screaming cowbirds visited nests repeatedly after laying and occasionally showed repeat parasitism. The higher frequency of revisiting by screaming cowbirds to baywing nests is consistent with the uncommonly long and variable baywing prelaying period, and the incidence of repeat parasitism may reflect low availability of baywing nests and greater flexibility of its parental care potential thanks to it being a social breeder. Significance statement: Avian brood parasites synchronize their laying with that of their hosts, as this reduces egg rejection and optimizes hatching time. They also avoid parasitizing nests repeatedly, thus preventing harm to their own previously laid eggs and competition among their offspring. Further, they lay at dawn, so that location of target nests must be known from previous days’ exploration. It has been argued that these adaptations must depend on memory for the location and status of host nests within their home range, a memory feat known as ‘bookkeeping’. We study nest prospecting in a host specialist and a host generalist parasitic cowbird, using a combination of proximity radio tracking and video recordings. Our results confirm the prospecting hypothesis, report previously unknown interspecies differences and illustrate how cognitive adaptations can be studied in the context of field behavioural ecology. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Article","Final","Scopus"

How can we accurately predict who that author might be when the message may never exceed 140 characters on a service like Twitter? For the past 50 years, linguists, computer scientists, and scholars of the humanities have been jointly developing automated methods to identify authors based on the style of their writing. All authors possess peculiarities of habit that influence the form and content of their written works. These characteristics can often be quantified and measured using machine learning algorithms.

Furthermore, we examine emerging supervised learning-based methods that are effective for small sample sizes, and provide step-by-step explanations for several scalable approaches as instructional case studies for newcomers to the field.

The upstream and downstream plasma actuators can be actuated individually, where it is found that the most significant control effect takes place when only the downstream plasma actuator is turned on. Such optimal conception is applied to a NACA 0012 airfoil and an unmanned aerial vehicle without and with flaps deflection. The present proposed plasma Gurney flap is found to have the similar lift-increment effect and the control mechanism with the conventional Gurney flap. A large-scale counterclockwise recirculation region forms over the airfoil pressure surface near the trailing edge with plasma control, acting as the virtual aeroshaping effect. Consequently, both the suction over the upper surface and the pressure over the lower surface are increased. Thus, the plasma Gurney flap can increase the lift coefficient before the stall angle, reduce the drag coefficient, and increase the lift-to-drag ratio at small angles of attack. In addition, the plasma Gurney flap has additional advantages, such as active control ability and small device drag, making it a very attractive lift-enhancement technique for aeronautical applications.

Ebullitive emissions exhibit high spatial and temporal variability and as such are difficult to measure. Traditional manual measurement techniques provide only limited localized assessment of methane flux, often introducing significant errors when extrapolated to the whole-of-system. This is further exacerbated when whole-of-region estimates are developed for inclusion in global greenhouse gas inventories. In this paper, we directly address these current sampling limitations by comparing two robot boat-based sampling systems with complementary sensing modalities to directly measure in real time the spatiotemporal release of methane to atmosphere across inland waterways. The first system consists of a single Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) fitted with an Optical Methane Detector with algorithms to exploit the robot's mobility and transect repeatability for the accurate detection and quantification of methane bubbles across whole-of-system. The second system consists of multiple networked ASVs capable of persistent operation and scalable to whole-of-region monitoring. Each ASV carries a novel automated chamber-based gas sampling system to allow simultaneous real-time measurement of methane across the waterway. These ASV systems provide a foundation for persistent large-scale spatiotemporal sampling allowing scientists to develop whole-of-region greenhouse gas estimates and greatly improve global inventory budgets. An overview of the single and multi-robot sampling systems is presented, including their automated methane detection and sampling methodologies for the spatiotemporal quantification of greenhouse gas release to atmosphere. Experimental results are shown demonstrating each system's ability to autonomously navigate, detect, and quantify methane release to atmosphere across an entire inland reservoir. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This is the case, for instance, for stacking cards in columns according to some allowed sequence or taking cards from a deal. This is true for both multi-player and solitaire patience games. Although they have such strong similarities, every game also has some peculiarity making it different, and affecting its complexity and -at the end of the day- its enjoyability. Interestingly, from an AI planning perspective, most of the differences emerge from the problem description: domain models tend to be very similar because of the similar actions that can be performed. In this paper we envisage the exploitation of solitaire card games as a pool of interesting benchmarks. In order to ""access"" such benchmarks, we exploit state-of-the-art tools for automated domain model generation -LOCM and ASCoL- for creating domain models corresponding to a number of solitaires, and extracting the underlying game constraints (e.g., the initial setup, stacking rules etc.) which come from problem models. The contribution of our work is twofold. On the one hand, the analysis of the generated models, and the learning process itself, gives insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches, highlighting lessons learned regarding sensitivity to observed traces. On the other hand, an experimental analysis shows that generated solitaires are challenging for the state-of-the-art of satisficing planning: therefore solitaires can provide a set of interesting and easy-to-extract benchmarks. © 2017, CEUR-WS.

Their residues in a daily consumed fish (grass carp) pose potential threat to human health and aquatic ecosystems. The present study optimized an analytical protocol of microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), lip-removal by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), cleanup by solid phase cartridge (SC) or adsorption chromatography column (CC), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Besides traditional statistical parameters, some indicators were calculated to judge the performances of extraction by various methods. The optimization experiment showed that n-hexane/acetone was the best MEA extraction solvent; an optimal fraction time of 10-39 min could simultaneously elute all the target chemicals in a single GPC run. Both CC and SC showed good recoveries. However, CC performed better than SC (p<0.05) for OCPs, and SC performed better than CC for PBDEs (p<0.05).

Exploiting well-assessed physical principles, an analysis of four different take-off approaches is carried out. The approaches are then compared on the basis of quantitative and qualitative criteria introduced to assess their technical and economic viability. In particular, the additional power required by the take-off functionality is computed and related to the peak mechanical power generated by the system. Moreover, the additionally required on-board mass is estimated, which impacts the cut-in wind speed of the generator. Finally, the approximate ground area required for take-off is also determined. After the theoretical comparison, a deeper study of the concept that is deemed the most viable one, i.e. a linear take-off maneuver combined with on-board propellers, is performed by means of numerical simulations. The simulation results are used to refine the initial analysis and further confirm the viability of the approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

An autonomous robot can function and complete every task without any human guidance. Since it functions without human intervention, therefore obstacles detection and localization are significant and need to figure out. First, how the robot obstacle detection? Second, how to control auto-navigation robot localization accuracy and stability motion of the robot? Both of conditions would significantly affect performance and accuracy of robot to detect and reach destination. Therefore, we needed to figure out few solutions to solve these problems before create an auto-navigation system. Initially, testing and using suitable detection sensors and design suitable algorithm for sensor to detect obstacles. Then, Global Positioning System (GPS) would be used to calculate based upon information from GPS receiver to mapping the shortest path for robot to reach destination. Lastly, timing of the robot will generate by using 50MHz default frequency of DE0-Nano to control motors and direction of the wheels. In addition, using DE0-Nano board the design operating frequency can reach maximum 1GHz. Furthermore, the potential resources of Quartus II version 14.1 are utilized to implement supported modules of auto-navigation robot stages. The design had been carried out on Altera Cyclone IV FPGA. The autonavigation robots were provided higher flexibility and could help people do to something which will develop into life-threatening.

We simulated flooding using an automated biogeochemical microcosm system that allows for systematical control of pre-defined redox windows. The EH value was increased mechanistically at intervals of approximately 100 mV from reducing (−211 mV) to oxidizing (475 mV) conditions. Soluble Tl levels (0.02–0.28 μg L−1) increased significantly with increases in EH (r = 0.80, p < 0.01, n = 30). Thallium mobilization was found to be related to several simultaneous processes involving the gradual oxidation of Tl-bearing sulfides, reductive dissolution of Fe-Mn oxides and desorption from mineral sorbents. Manganese oxides did not appear to have a considerable effect on Tl retention under oxidizing conditions. Before conducting the microcosm experiment, Tl geochemical fractionation was assessed using the modified BCR sequential extraction procedure. The BCR revealed a majority of Tl in the residual fraction (77.7%), followed by reducible (13.3%) and oxidizable fractions (5.9%). By generating high levels of Tl toxicity at low doses, Tl released under oxidizing conditions may pose an environmental threat. In the future, similar studies should be conducted on various soils along with a determination of the Tl species and monitoring of the Tl content in plants to achieve more detailed insight into soluble Tl behavior. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

Yet long-term population data for many species are sporadic, given the location, physical nature of many colonies, and known negative impacts of investigator interaction. The low cost of unmanned aerial systems (UASs), or drones, has democratized access to remote sensing data with high spatial and temporal resolution. Although there are limitations and risks of employing drones for conservation and data-collection purposes, the benefits include the ability to monitor a greater number of colonies at higher spatial and temporal resolutions than traditional field methods. The establishment of drone-operation guidelines, however, is an important first-step in minimizing disturbance to surface-nesting birds, given that many surface-nesting birds are particularly vulnerable to disturbances that can reduce reproductive output and increase stress responses. Research on the disturbance to wildlife from drones is in its infancy, but here we briefly review whether and how studies have evaluated the impact of drones on their study species. We review as well the variability in physiological and behavioural responses observed, and whether the studies evaluated the risk of malfunction or crashes, common with off-the-shelf drone platforms. We found that attention to evaluating disturbance and risk assessments has been limited, but preliminary evidence suggests drones can reduce disturbance impacts on some species. On the other hand, in the face of widespread drone deployment, inexpensive and rapid data collection should not be put ahead of the potential risk and impact on species. © 2017, Marine Ornithology.

A new approach is also discussed to improve the accuracy of position and attitude estimates of the localization by feeding back angular information extracted from the detected edges in the updating map. The innovative aspects of the line detection algorithm regard the proposed hierarchical clusterization method for segmentation. Instead, line fitting is carried out by exploiting the Principal Component Analysis, unlike traditional techniques relying on least squares linear regression. Numerical simulations are purposely conceived to compare these approaches for line fitting. Results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed technique as it provides comparable performance in terms of computational load and accuracy compared to the least squares method. Also, performance of the overall line detection architecture, as well as of the solutions proposed for line-based mapping and localization-aiding, is evaluated exploiting real range data acquired in indoor environments using an UTM-30LX-EW 2D LIDAR.

Traditional parallel block-matching algorithms are primarily used to leverage the huge number of computational cores in graphic processing units, which can be used to compute the block-matching operation at each candidate position in a search range by an independent thread of kernel computation. In realistic scenarios, the time used to transfer pixel values among the various memory modules to fulfill the operation in a GPU system is much higher than the computation time used for computing each block-matching operation by the kernel threads. This leads to a performance improvement bottleneck for GPU algorithm design. The proposed algorithm exploits the characteristics of distinct memory modules on the data transfer speed for the block-matching algorithm and proposes a feasible mechanism to reduce the bandwidth of data transmission required for the parallel block-matching algorithms implemented on GPU system. With experiments on GPU systems, the proposed parallel block-matching algorithm gains up to 99% execution reduction of motion estimation compared to the host processor only motion estimation process. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In a framework of particle filtering, a camera measurement model that emulates the camera’s observation of underwater structures is designed. The particle weight is then updated based on the extracted visual information of the underwater structures. Detected artificial landmarks are also used in the particle weight update.

In order to compare, a procedure for evaluation was selected based on integral assessments of unconditional and conditional criteria. An analysis was conducted among the algorithms that fulfilled general unconditional criteria. As conditional criteria, we chose numerical characteristics of algorithms. In addition, additional unconditional criteria were put forward that differed depending on the conditions of use. The relevance of present research is associated with the emergence of a quantum computer. Previous studies have already proved that the existing cryptographic algorithms are vulnerable to the methods of quantum cryptanalysis. That is why, at present, leading organizations in the standardization of crypto algorithms conduct research and comparisons for selecting the post-quantum standard of cryptography. As a result of present research, we found a lack of a universal post-quantum cryptographic algorithm. In addition, not all algorithms can be employed under different conditions. It is proposed to separate three variants in the application of post-quantum algorithms: for lightweight cryptography, for the use by standard automated systems and use in a cloud-based environment. For all conditions of use, a separate evaluation of benefits in the cryptographic algorithms was carried out. We detected shortcomings in the leading candidate in that it may possible have a reduced resistance for the specialized quantum attack. That is why the recommendations were given to employ these algorithms as the basic ones in the transition period. And, if the suspicion is confirmed, then we proposed alternatives for each variant of application. Results of present research allow us to understand current state in the development of post-quantum crypto algorithms and to predict their possible further development. This forecast is important in that the post-quantum cryptographic mechanisms represent a new stage in the development and use of cryptography. In addition, the practical value of the research consists in obtaining the evaluation for post-quantum algorithms, depending on the conditions of their application.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, a self-aware communication architecture (SACA) is proposed for sustainable networking over IoT devices. The proposed approach employs the concept of mobile fog servers which make relay using the train and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. The problem is presented based on Wald's maximum model, which is resolved by the application of a distributed node management (DNM) system and state dependency formulations. The proposed approach is capable of providing prolonged connectivity by increasing the network reliability and sustainability even in the case of failures. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical and network simulations in terms of significant gains attained with lesser delay and fewer packet losses.

In the present study, a numerical modeling based on MPS method was completed and validated against the experimental data, and then the thermal erosion mechanisms of lower head wall by different molten corium jets were analyzed and the approach of coating a ZrO2 liner to delay the thermal erosion was proposed. The results indicated that the heat transfer to lower head wall was dominated by forced convection for molten SS jet condition, while for Zr, ZrO2 and UO2 jet conditions the heat transfer at lower head wall surface was mainly through conduction due to the existence of crust and melted carbon steel layer. The insulating effect of the crust and melted carbon steel layer could delay the thermal erosion significantly, but the impingement of molten SS jet with superheat degree at about 300 K or higher was a great threat to lower head wall integrity.

Using the first systematic data set of UAV proliferation, this research note examines the spread of UAVs in the context of scholarly debates about interests versus capacity in explaining policy adoption. The results yield important insights for both IR scholarship and the policy-making community. While countries that experience security threats-including territorial disputes and terrorism- A re more likely to seek UAVs, drone proliferation is not simply a function of the threat environment. We find evidence that democracies and autocracies are more likely than mixed regimes to develop armed UAV programs, and suggest that autocracies and democracies have their own unique incentives to acquire this technology. Moreover, supply-side factors play a role in the UAV proliferation process: A state's technological capacity is a strong predictor of whether it will obtain the most sophisticated UAVs.

The segmentation algorithm automatically reconstructs cardiac MRI DICOM data into a 3-D model (i.e., direct volumetric segmentation), without relying on prior statistical knowledge. Methods: A novel 3-D active contour method was employed to detect the left ventricular cavity in 33 subjects with heterogeneous heart diseases from the York University database. Papillary muscles were identified and added to the chamber using a convex hull of the left ventricle and interpolation. The myocardium was then segmented using a similar 3-D segmentation method according to anatomic information. A multistage approach was taken to determine the method's efficacy. Results: Our method demonstrated a significant improvement in segmentation performance when compared to manual segmentation and other automated methods. Conclusion and Significance: A true 3-D reconstruction technique without the need for training datasets or any user-driven segmentation has been developed. In this method, a novel combination of internal and external energy terms for active contour was utilized that exploits histogram matching for improving the segmentation performance.

Individual mobility can be expanded to parties including the physically challenged, the elderly and the young. However, this article will consider two associated aspects of autonomous driving namely, privacy implications and issues of liability. Despite the many advantages of autonomous or connected vehicles, the downside in respect of privacy is that the ability to move about in relative anonymity will be lost. A secret rendezvous with a lover will be a thing of the past because the data bank associated with such vehicles will include information regarding exactly who is riding, where the passengers were picked up and dropped off, at what time and what route was taken. This information is a legitimate (and potentially very valuable!) business asset of the companies that own and operate autonomous vehicle fleets, who rely on such data to analyse how many vehicles are needed, in which locations and when they should be charged or re-fuelled, but the consequences on privacy (and the susceptibility of cyberattack) are tangible. Similarly, whilst another advantage of autonomous driving is that traffic accidents may be virtually eliminated, some people will nevertheless die or be injured in accidents involving autonomous vehicles. Therefore, in autonomous driving, a key question is that of liability and, specifically, where liability should reside in the event of such accident. This article considers how best to exploit autonomous vehicle innovation whilst, at the same time, securing the type of regulation appropriate to deal with the issues raised above. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","Scopus"

These changes have considerable ethical implications as sports medicine team members are placed in challenging ethical decision-making situations that often create values tensions. These values conflicts have the potential to threaten and degrade the trust established through the mutual expectations inherent in the social contract between the health care providers and society. According to Starr,1 the social contract is defined as the relationship between medicine and society that is renegotiated in response to the complexities of modern medicine and contemporary society. Anchored in expectations of both society and the medical professions, this tacit contract provides a strong compass for professional practice as it exemplifies the powerful role and examines the deep responsibilities held by health care providers in our society. Although governed by professional boards and organizational codes of ethics, sports medicine professionals are challenged by the conflicts of interest between paternalistic care for the athlete and autonomous decisions often influenced by stakeholders other than the athletes themselves. Understanding how the construct of sport has impacted sports health care will better prepare sports medicine professionals for the ethical challenges they will likely face and, more importantly, facilitate awareness and change of the critical importance of upholding the integrity of the professional social contract. © 2017 Human Kinetics – IJATT.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In fact, because underwater sites of interest are often difficult for divers to access, the use of unmanned vehicle technology to conduct surveys could be quite advantageous. In this paper, a novel and partially-biomimetic underwater robot, referred to as BRAVe (Biomimetic Research Autonomous Vehicle), is presented. For documentation purposes, it is equipped with a hybrid propulsion system, which consists of two different types of thrusters. The thrusters are designed to compensate for their reciprocal flaws in order to achieve a more efficient overall system. Specifically, the biomimetic thruster is employed for its superior energetic efficiency, and the horizontal propellers are exploited for accurate maneuvering. While the documentation and 3D reconstruction of the underwater seabed is a consolidated aspect for the authors, the hybrid propulsion system represents the main innovation of the present work. The increase in efficiency achieved by this propulsion system allows the vehicle to perform a thorough and precise documentation of underwater remains within short distances, while exploiting the maximum possible autonomy. This article discusses the details of the development of all the vehicle compartments and their associated characteristics, focusing on the significance of this technology.

Like lunar surface, dust particles are also exposed to plasmas and UV radiation and, consequently they carry electrostatic charges. During Solar Energetic Particle events (SEPs) secondary electron emission plays a vital role in charging of lunar dusts. To study the lunar dust charging during SEPs on lunar wake region, we derived an expression for lunar dust potential and analysed how it varies with different electron temperatures and grain radii. Because of high energetic solar fluxes, secondary yield (δ) values reach up to 2.3 for 0.5 μm dust grain. We got maximum yield at an energy of 550 eV which is in well agreement with lunar sample experimental observation (Anderegg et al., 1972). It is observed that yield value increases with electron energy, reaches to a maximum value and then decreases. During SEPs heavier dust grains show larger yield values because of the geometry of the grains. On the wake region, the dust potential reaches up to −497 V for 0.5 μm dust grain. The electric field of these grains could present a significant threat to manned and unmanned missions to the Moon. © 2016 COSPAR","Article","Final","Scopus"

The Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have significant potential in the development of ITS where the estimation of the vehicle's position represents a key role. However, in strongly constrained environments, such as city centers, the definition of positioning performances is a challenge due to the variability of the different urban scenarios, the modeling of the dynamics as well as the architecture of the positioning platform, which might embed other sensors and aiding means to the GNSS unit. Moreover, the performance metrics of interest are not just position and speed but metrics related to the integrity/reliability concept, properly defined for the road environment. These performance metrics are becoming of paramount interest, as safety-critical application emerging, and have to be assessed. This framework asks for a deep understanding by the ITS sector of the achievable performance by GNSS systems in the different scenarios for automotive. In fact, positioning is taken as a fully reliable and accurate information, based on which more and more automated driving operations are performed. For this reason, the need of standardized performance metrics for GNSS-Based Positioning Terminal (GBPT) and the associated performance assessment procedures and scenarios assume considerable importance. The main focus of the paper is to introduce a performance evaluation procedure based on a record and replay approach able to represent meaningful and realistic scenarios. This approach requires proper data collections that allow the replay phase and data postprocessing to test the GBPT performance. The paper presents also some results obtained on a set of field tests related to different scenarios, selected as representative of reference scenarios for the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) assessment. © 2017, Institute of Navigation.

Methods: Standard segmentation priors such as a Potts model or total variation usually fail when dealing with thin and elongated structures. We overcome this difficulty by using a conditional random field model with more expressive potentials, taking advantage of recent results enabling inference of fully connected models almost in real time. Parameters of the method are learned automatically using a structured output support vector machine, a supervised technique widely used for structured prediction in a number of machine learning applications. Results: Our method, trained with state of the art features, is evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively on four publicly available datasets: DRIVE, STARE, CHASEDB1, and HRF. Additionally, a quantitative comparison with respect to other strategies is included. Conclusion: The experimental results show that this approach outperforms other techniques when evaluated in terms of sensitivity, F1-score, G-mean, and Matthews correlation coefficient. Additionally, it was observed that the fully connected model is able to better distinguish the desired structures than the local neighborhood-based approach. Significance: Results suggest that this method is suitable for the task of segmenting elongated structures, a feature that can be exploited to contribute with other medical and biological applications. © 1964-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

For an aircraft undergoing stall, the aerodynamic model at these high angles of attack becomes non linear due to the influence of unsteady, transient and flow separation phenomena. In order to address these issues the Kirchhoff's flow separation theory was used to incorporate the nonlinearity in the aerodynamic model in terms of flow separation point and stall characteristic parameters. The classical Maximum Likelihood (MLE) method and Neural Gauss-Newton (NGN) method have been employed to estimate the nonlinear parameters of two manned and one unmanned research aircrafts. The estimated static stall parameter and the break point, for the flight vehicles under consideration, were observed to be consistent from both the methods. Moreover the efficacy of the methods is also evident from the consistent estimates of post stall hysteresis time constant. It can also be inferred that the considered quasi steady model is able to adequately capture the drag and pitching moment coefficients in the post stall regime. The confidence in these estimates have been significantly enhanced with the observed lower values of Cramer-Rao bounds. Further the estimated nonlinear parameters were validated by performing a proof of match exercise for the considered flight vehicles. Interestingly the NGN method, which doesn't involve solving equations of motion, was able to perform on a par with the MLE method. © 2017, DESIDOC.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Blood culturing is currently the gold standard for the identification of microorganisms and, although it has been automated over the decade, the process still requires 24–72 h to complete. This long turnaround time, especially for the identification of antimicrobial resistance, is driving the development of rapid molecular diagnostic methods. Rapid detection of microbial pathogens in blood related to bloodstream infections will allow the clinician to decide on or adjust the antimicrobial therapy potentially reducing the morbidity, mortality, and economic burden associated with BSI. For molecular-based methods, there is a lot to gain from an improved and straightforward method for isolation of bacteria from whole blood for downstream processing. We describe a microfluidic-based sample-preparation approach that rapidly and selectively lyses all blood cells while it extracts intact bacteria for downstream analysis. Whole blood is exposed to a mild detergent, which lyses most blood cells, and then to osmotic shock using deionized water, which eliminates the remaining white blood cells.

"Design and Performance Analysis of Three-Dimensional Air Intakes for Supersonic Combustion Ramjet Engines","2017","DLR Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V. - Forschungsberichte","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014730858&partnerID=40&md5=ee6d49dbdf6bd5ee995d6cc12d3814b4","The Supersonic Combustion Ramjet (SCRamjet) engine is an efficient propulsion device for supersonic and hypersonic velocities. The SCRamjet uses air from the surrounding atmosphere for the combustion process and therefore no oxidizer has to be carried on board. Furthermore, with higher velocities the ram compression increases and no compressor stage with rotating parts is needed. Thus, at supersonic and hypersonic velocities the SCRamjet engine becomes more efficient when compared to rocket or jet engines. The present work focuses on the SCRamjet air intake which serves as the engine's compressor and is a crucial component. More specifically different topics related to analytical intake design and to general performance characterization of three-dimensional SCRamjet intakes were examined. First, an analytical intake design tool was developed. To start, an axisymmelric Busemann or reversed nozzle flow was truncated at the leading edge or rear end. The changes caused by the truncation were modeled analytically. Then, from the axisymmetric flow field, streamlines were traced to generate a fully three-dimensional geometry. Along the individual streamlines the boundary layer displacement thickness was calculated with an integral method. This served two purposes: First, the geometry was widened with the displacement thickness to counteract additional contraction by the viscous boundary layer. Second, friction drag was calculated. The analytical results of axisymmetric and fully three-dimensional configurations were validated with numerical simulations. Numerical results were within 3% and 8% of the analytical predictions for inviscid and viscous flows, respectively. Second, the starting behavior of hypersonic air intakes was investigated experimentally in a blow down wind tunnel with a three-dimensional intake model (3D-GRK) with planar surfaces. Influence of intake cowl, free stream Mach number and angle of attack on intake starting were investigated. The self-starting configurations were all within the critical region of the Kantrowitz diagram, where intake starting should not occur according to Kantrowitz theory. In particular, the straight cowl in comparison to the v-shaped cowl allowed for more overboard spillage, therefore improving the starting characteristics. The increase in free stream Mach number raised the internal contraction ratio, at which intakes were still self-starting. Angle of attack effects were twofold: On the one hand, for positive pitch angle and no yaw deflection, intake starting was enhanced. On the other hand, for negative pitch angle or yaw deflection, starting was delayed. The experimental data were used to develop correlations to better predict intake starting. The correlations were within the critical region of the Kantrowitz plot and agreed with the experimental data and with data collected from literature. Third, the 3D-GRK intake was further investigated experimentally and results were compared to numerical simulations. Experimental and numerical results agreed to within the uncertainty of the measurements and only minor displacements near regions with separated flow were detected. To simulate pressure peaks stemming from the combustion process a throttle was attached to the intake model. The intake behavior under back pressure was investigated and the captured mass flow was measured. Captured mass flow, operating pressure ratio, and maximum sustainable pressure ratio before unstart all decreased as free stream Mach number was lowered. The ratio of maximum sustainable pressure to operating pressure, however, was constant at around 4:1. To yield performance parameters at flight condition, the numerical simulations were extrapolated to flight condition. During extrapolation, the change in performance was below 2%, therefore practically negligible. Finally, the performance of the 3D-GRK intake configurations was compared to performance of different streamline traced intakes. The streamline traced configurations consisted of continuously curved surfaces, which generated portions of isentropic compression. The 3D-GRK intake, in contrast, consisted of planar surfaces, and its performance, i.e. compression efficiency or total pressure recovery, was therefore lower. After post-processing with one-dimensional combustor and nozzle tools the streamline traced configurations had specific impulses of about 3200 s, 2700 s, and 2300 s for free stream Mach numbers of 6, 7, and 8, respectively. For the same Mach numbers specific impulse of the 3D-GRK configuration was approximately 300 s lower.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Due to its low costs and wide availability, carotid ultrasound has the potential to become the modality of choice for plaque characterization in clinical practice. However, its significant image noise, coupled with the small size of the plaques and their complex appearance, makes it difficult for automated techniques to discriminate between the different plaque constituents. In this paper, we propose to address this challenging problem by exploiting the unique capabilities of the emerging deep learning framework. More specifically, and unlike existing works which require a priori definition of specific imaging features or thresholding values, we propose to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that will automatically extract from the images the information that is optimal for the identification of the different plaque constituents. We used approximately 90 000 patches extracted from a database of images and corresponding expert plaque characterizations to train and to validate the proposed CNN. The results of cross-validation experiments show a correlation of about 0.90 with the clinical assessment for the estimation of lipid core, fibrous cap, and calcified tissue areas, indicating the potential of deep learning for the challenging task of automatic characterization of plaque composition in carotid ultrasound. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

By using a multi-camera setup we can introduce an absolute scale into our reconstruction. Multiple views also allow us to obtain depth from multiple disparity sources: static disparity between the different cameras of the rig and temporal disparity by exploiting rig motion. We propose a joint optimization of the rig poses and the camera poses within the rig which enables working with flexible rigs. We show that sub-pixel rigidity is difficult to manufacture for 720p or higher resolution cameras which makes this feature important, particularly in current and future (semi-)autonomous cars or drones.

Increased EPSPS gene copy numbers results in higher titers of the EPSPS enzyme, the target of glyphosate, and confers resistance to glyphosate treatment. To understand the genomic unit and mechanism of EPSPS gene copy number proliferation, we developed and used a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library from a highly resistant biotype to sequence the local genomic landscape flanking the EPSPS gene. Results: By sequencing overlapping BACs, a 297 kb sequence was generated, hereafter referred to as the ""EPSPS cassette."" This region included several putative genes, dense clusters of tandem and inverted repeats, putative helitron and autonomous replication sequences, and regulatory elements. Whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) of two biotypes exhibiting high and no resistance to glyphosate was performed to compare genomic representation across the EPSPS cassette. Mapping of sequences for both biotypes to the reference EPSPS cassette revealed significant differences in upstream and downstream sequences relative to EPSPS with regard to both repetitive units and coding content between these biotypes. The differences in sequence may have resulted from a compounded-building mechanism such as repetitive transpositional events. The association of putative helitron sequences with the cassette suggests a possible amplification and distribution mechanism. Flow cytometry revealed that the EPSPS cassette added measurable genomic content. Conclusions: The adoption of glyphosate resistant cropping systems in major crops such as corn, soybean, cotton and canola coupled with excessive use of glyphosate herbicide has led to evolved glyphosate resistance in several important weeds. In Amaranthus palmeri, the amplification of the EPSPS cassette, characterized by a complex array of repetitive elements and putative helitron sequences, suggests an adaptive structural genomic mechanism that drives amplification and distribution around the genome. The added genomic content not found in glyphosate sensitive plants may be driving evolution through genome expansion. © 2016 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

A study on deletion flaws and data remanence in android systems","2017","ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","10.1145/3007211","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011333664&doi=10.1145%2f3007211&partnerID=40&md5=823cc0c7d2d59ddf9b8c16454dc6d6f7","Smart mobile devices are becoming the main vessel of personal privacy information. While they carry valuable information, data erasure is somehow much more vulnerable than was predicted. The security mechanisms provided by the Android system are not flexible enough to thoroughly delete sensitive data. In addition to the weakness among several provided data-erasing and file-deleting mechanisms, we also target the Android OS design flaws in data erasure, and unveil that the design of the Android OS contradicts some secure data-erasure demands. We present the data-erasure flaws in three typical scenarios on mainstream Android devices, such as the data clearing flaw, application uninstallation flaw, and factory reset flaw. Some of these flaws are inherited data-deleting security issues from the Linux kernel, and some are new vulnerabilities in the Android system. Those scenarios reveal the data leak points in Android systems. Moreover, we reveal that the data remanence on the disk is rarely affected by the user's daily operation, such as file deletion and app installation and uninstallation, by a real-world data deletion latency experiment. After one volunteer used the Android phone for 2 months, the data remanence amount was still considerable. Then, we proposed DataRaider for file recovering from disk fragments. It adopts a file-carving technique and is implemented as an automated sensitive information recovering framework. DataRaider is able to extract private data in a raw disk image without any file system information, and the recovery rate is considerably high in the four test Android phones. We propose some mitigation for data remanence issues, and give the users some suggestions on data protection in Android systems. © 2017 ACM.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"Computational aerodynamic modeling tools for aircraft loss of control","2017","Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics","10.2514/1.G001736","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018631540&doi=10.2514%2f1.G001736&partnerID=40&md5=ed62495d61be65bb6772ba96d3774044","This paper summarizes the status of ongoing NASA research supported over the past eight years to advance computational capabilities for modeling civil aircraft loss of control due to airframe damage or wing stall. The research is motivated by a desire to exploit the capabilities of computational methods to create augmented flight simulation models that improve pilot training for such loss-of-control scenarios. Flight of aircraft with either airframe damage or operating near and beyond the stall boundary encounters additional nonlinear aerodynamic influences on stability and control from dynamic motions that, if not included in flight simulation models, may lead to incorrect pilot responses. In the present work, both low- and high-fidelity computational methods are explored for analyzing such nonlinearities. The challenge of creating nonlinear reduced-order models from high-fidelity computational data is also addressed. At the beginning, few guidelines were available for computing or modeling the dynamic stability characteristics of civil aircraft in nonlinear stalled flight regimes. To accelerate progress, additional resources were leveraged through participation in two NATO task groups consisting of a diverse international body of computational aerodynamicists and flight simulation experts. As a result, a large body of knowledge has been generated, documenting the state of the art for computing and modeling the highly nonlinear stability characteristics of an unmanned air combat vehicle. This knowledge was infused directly into the NASA loss-of-control work through parallel application studies with the NASA Generic Transport Model. From this, it is concluded that the Reynoldsaveraged Navier-Stokes formulation should suffice for capturing the representative behavior of civil aircraft stall for training purposes. Furthermore, promising approaches have been identified for creating nonlinear reduced-order models from computational data that can potentially augment flight simulation models for loss-of-control scenarios.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The complex interplay of clonal spread, persistence, transmission of resistance elements and cell-cell interaction leads to the difficulty in controlling infections caused by these multi drug-resistant strains. Among non-fermenting Gram-negative rods, the most clinically significant species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia are increasingly acquiring resistant to carbapenems. Carbapenems once considered as a backbone of treatment of life threatening infections appears to be broken as the resistance to carbapenems is on rise. Aim: To document the prevalence of carbapenem resistance in non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections in the ICU of Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences, Dehradun. Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in ICU patients between October 2015 to March 2016. A total of 366 lower respiratory tract samples were collected from 356 patients with clinical evidence of lower respiratory tract infections in form of Endotracheal (ET) aspirate, Tracheal Tube (TT) aspirate and Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) specimen. Organism identification and the susceptibility testing was done by using an automated system VITEK 2. Results: Out of 366 samples received 99 NFGNB were isolated and most common sample was ET aspirate sample 256 (64.5%). Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common NFGNB isolated 63 (63.63%) followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 25 (25.25%), Elizabethkingia meningoseptica seven (7.07%) and Strenotrophomonas maltophilia four (4.04%). We observed that 90.5% Acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to imipenem and 95.2% resistant to meropenem, Pseudomonas aeruginosa came out to be 52% resistant to imipenem and 56% resistant to meropenem while Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica were 100% resistant to carbapenems as they are intrinsically resistant to carbapenems. Conclusion: The resistance rate of carbapenems for NFGNB infections is very high in our study and variable in different regions. Overall carbapenem resistance is on rise. So, the infection control team and microbiologist needs to work together to determine the risk carried by multi drug resistant non-fermenting gram-negative infections and the resistance surveillance programs are mandatory to control these bacteria in ICU settings. © 2017, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

For example, digital cameras are essential components of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and robotic agents for mobile sensing and inspection of pipelines, buildings, transportation infrastructure, etc, especially in post-natural disaster and man-made extreme events assessment. Additionally, while surveillance cameras have been widely used for transportation systems (e.g., traffic monitoring), if appropriately mounted on the large-scale structures such as the bridges, they can continuously monitor the structural condition under operational loads and hazards, complementing the regular visual inspection and assessment conducted by experts. In these or other applications, efficiently and reliably transferring the structural images or videos, which are as such large-scale, are important and challenging, especially in wireless platform that is either required (e.g., UAVs and robotic agents) or more suitable (e.g., camera monitoring networks) with only limited power and communication resources. This paper studies the computational algorithms for efficient and reliable transmission of the structural monitoring images; in particular, the compressed sensing (CS) technique is explored for robust data transmission and recovery. The sparse representation or data structure of the structural images is exploited, leading to the CS based central strategy: on some sparse domain, randomly encode large-scale image data into few relevant coefficients, which are then transferred (robust to random data loss) and recovered (in base station) for subsequent structural health diagnosis. Image data of bench scale pipe structure, concrete structure and full scale stay cable are employed for validation of the CS based method. Its performance is also compared with traditional transform coding and low-dimensional encoding (sampling), and their advantages and drawbacks are discussed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Cameras give a lot of information and are low-cost device sensor rather than the other sensors which can be mounted on the vehicle. One of the visual information which can be acquired by autonomous vehicle for its navigation is traffic sign. Thus, this work addresses a traffic sign recognition framework as part of the autonomous vehicle. For recognizing the traffic sign, it is assumed that the traffic sign regions have been extracted using maximally extremal stable region (MSER). Using a heuristic rule of geometry properties, the false detections will be excluded. Furthermore, traffic sign images are classified using low dimensional features which were encoded using Adversarial Auto-encoder technique. Using this strategy, classification task can be performed using 2-dimensional features while improving the classification results over the high dimensional grayscale features. Extensive experiments were carried out over German traffic sign recognition database show that the proposed method provides reliable results. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Then the improved threat netting model is built up, which can well fulfill all the netting threats, especially for those far away from the ship-based UAV path but can influence it after intelligence exchange.

During their missions, these sUAS can encounter other cooperative or non-cooperative airspace participants (manned aircraft or other unmanned aerial vehicles) resulting in potential collision threats. To ensure a time efficient and distinct detection and separation of possible collision threats, an automated and self-reliant DAA system must be implemented into the sUAS. The proposed DAA system architecture is subdivided in a detection and an avoidance concept presentation. The detection concept uses a miniaturized frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar system for the detection of other airspace participants. This enables sUAS an enhanced cost-effective and all-weather capable detection ability up to 1.5 kilometers, depending on the detected object. The proposed three-dimensional avoidance concept is a further developed modification of the proportional navigation guidance law, designed to avoid a dynamic moving obstacle by aligning the sUAS ownship’ velocity vector tangential to a specific collision cone around the potential collision threat. Main emphasis is set on tiltwing sUAS and their entire flight envelope considering all flight states from vertical to horizontal flight. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This aerofoil features of camber morphing with multiple degrees of freedom. The shape morphing is enabled by an innovative structure driven by an electrical actuation system that uses linear ultrasonic motors (LUSM) with compliant runners, enabling full control of multiple degrees of freedom. The compliant runners also serve as structural components that carry the aerodynamic load and maintain a smooth skin curvature. The morphing structure with compliant truss is shown to exhibit a satisfactory flexibility and loading capacity in both numerical simulations and static loading tests. This design is capable of providing a pitching moment control independent of lift and higher L/D ratios within a wider angle-of-attack range. Such multiple morphing configurations could expand the flight envelope of future unmanned aerial vehicles. A small prototype is built to illustrate the concept, but as no off-the-shelf LUSMs can be integrated into this benchtop model, two servos are employed as actuators, providing two controlled degrees of freedom. © Royal Aeronautical Society 2016.","Article","Final","Scopus"

AF is associated with stroke and systemic thromboembolism, unpleasant symptoms and reduced quality of life, heart failure, and increased mortality, and treatment of AF and its complications are associated with significant cost. Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) can suppress AF, allowing long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm, and have the potential to relieve symptoms and reverse or prevent adverse effects associated with AF. However, large randomized controlled studies evaluating use of AADs have not demonstrated a clear benefit to maintaining sinus rhythm, and AADs often have significant limitations, including a modest rate of overall success at maintaining sinus rhythm, frequent side effects, and potentially life-threatening toxicities. Although some of the currently available AADs have been available for almost 100 years, better tolerated and more efficacious AADs have recently been developed both for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm and for chemical cardioversion of AF to sinus rhythm. Advances in automated AF detection with cardiac implantable electronic devices have suggested that AADs might be useful for suppressing AF to allow safe discontinuation of anticoagulation in select patients who are in sinus rhythm for prolonged periods of time. AADs may also have synergistic effects with catheter ablation of AF.

Methods All the bacterial strains isolated from pediatric inpatients in Beijing Children's Hospital during the period from 2009 to 2015 were analyzed. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion method and Phoenix 100 Automated Microbiology System. Results were analyzed according to the guidelines of CLSI (2014) using WHONET 5.6 software. Results The total strains were 26 630. The most common gram-positive isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS), while the most frequently isolated gram-negative microorganisms were Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The prevalence of S. pneumoniae was up to 25.7 % (4 101/15 973) in all respiratory tract specimens. About 50.2 % of the S. pneumoniae isolates were not susceptible to penicillin. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant strains was 20.6 % in S. aureus (MRSA) and 87.8 % in coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) on average. The prevalence of MRSA increased from 11.1 % in 2009 to 29.8 % in 2015. No S. pneumoniae or staphylococcal strains were found resistant to vancomycin or linezolid. The Enterococcus strains were still highly susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid. Overall 0.3 % of the Enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to vancomycin. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) producing strains accounted for 71.4 %-78.1 % of E. coli and 65.1 %-76.9 % of K. pneumoniae isolates. The carbapenem-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae were reported for the first time in 2010, but in 2014, the strains resistant to carbapenems had increased to more than 7 % in E. coli, and higher than 20 % in K. pneumoniae.

In particular, the nonlinear dynamics of non-autonomous agents is given and cannot be designed, while the dynamics of semi-autonomous and autonomous agents can be partially and fully designed, respectively. To improve the robustness of multi-agent chains against disturbances, we propose a nonlinear control framework for semi-autonomous and autonomous agents such that they mimic the behavior of non-autonomous agents for compatibility while also exploiting long-range connections with distant agents. This framework ensures the existence of a unique consensus equilibrium, which is independent of the network size, connectivity topologies, control gains and information delays. Robustness of multi-agent chains against disturbances is investigated by evaluating the frequency response at the nonlinear level. For infinitely long multi-agent chains with recurrent patterns, we also derive a condition that ensures the disturbance attenuation but only requires the analysis of the linearized model.

In this paper, a comprehensive long-term study of a mobile robot providing information services to residents, visitors, and staff of a care home is presented, with a focus on adapting to the when and where the robot should be offering its services to best accommodate the users' needs. Rather than providing a fixed schedule, the presented system takes the opportunity of long-term deployment to explore the space of possibilities of interaction while concurrently exploiting the model learned to provide better services. But in order to provide effective services to users in a care home, not only then when and where are relevant, but also the way how the information is provided and accessed. Hence, also the usability of the deployed system is studied specifically, in order to provide a most comprehensive overall assessment of a robotic info-terminal implementation in a care setting. Our results back our hypotheses, (i) that learning a spatio-temporal model of users' intentions improves efficiency and usefulness of the system, and (ii) that the specific information sought after is indeed dependent on the location the info-terminal is offered. © 2017 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Artificial potential field (APF) UAV path planning method is often employed to build an intuitive model which is updated by the additional forces pushing the trajectory away from threats of non-cooperative objects and toward the predefined target. However, APF has its own weaknesses, one of which is the local minima close to concave obstacles. To tackle situation mentioned above, we propose a novel additional force model based on virtual waypoints. This model provides additional forces for candidate planning points falling into local minimum area and help them escape from local minimum area. Once the candidate is trapped in minimum area, firstly we calculate measure factor according to the planning area containing current candidate and the target point, and thus determine position of the virtual waypoint. Then the virtual waypoint generates additional control force so that the candidate can run away from the local minimum area. Finally, the simulation results show that the method can solve the local minimum problem in planning space. © 2016 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Commonly, elderly people are more vulnerable to life-threatening arrhythmias, namely Atrial Fibrillation (A-Fib), Atrial Flutter (AFL) and Ventricular Fibrillation (V-Fib). Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the primary diagnostic tool that can be used to detect and diagnose cardiac abnormalities including serious arrhythmias. Therefore, using ECG signal beats, we have proposed a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for automated diagnosis of serious arrhythmias. The ECG beats are analyzed using thirteen nonlinear features namely, Shannon entropy, Fuzzy entropy, Tsallis entropy, approximate entropy, Permutation entropy, Modified Multi Scale entropy, Wavelet entropy, Sample entropy, Renyi entropy, Signal Energy, Fractal Dimension, Kolmogorov Sinai entropy and Largest Lyapunov Exponent. Subsequently, the extracted features are ranked using ANOVA and subjected to automated classification using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers. In addition, the extracted features are trained and tested with ten-fold cross validation analysis. DT classifier yielded 96.3% accuracy, 99.3% sensitivity and 84.1% specificity with 14 features and the KNN classifier yielded 93.3% accuracy, 97.5% sensitivity and 75.3% specificity using 12 features. Positively, the proposed CAD system is able to assist the clinical staff in the arrhythmias diagnosis by making the process faster and simpler. Consequently, the necessary treatments can be given expeditiously. © 2016 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Efficient isolation and detection methods are prerequisites for exploiting their use in clinical settings and understanding their physiological functions. Here, we presented a rapid, label-free, and highly sensitive method for EV isolation and quantification using a lab-on-a-disc integrated with two nanofilters (Exodisc). Starting from raw biological samples, such as cell-culture supernatant (CCS) or cancer-patient urine, fully automated enrichment of EVs in the size range of 20-600 nm was achieved within 30 min using a tabletop-sized centrifugal microfluidic system. Quantitative tests using nanoparticle-tracking analysis confirmed that the Exodisc enabled >95% recovery of EVs from CCS. Additionally, analysis of mRNA retrieved from EVs revealed that the Exodisc provided >100-fold higher concentration of mRNA as compared with the gold-standard ultracentrifugation method. Furthermore, on-disc enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using urinary EVs isolated from bladder cancer patients showed high levels of CD9 and CD81 expression, suggesting that this method may be potentially useful in clinical settings to test urinary EV-based biomarkers for cancer diagnostics. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Many applications for mobile robots in urban environments may be considered such as self-driving cars, delivery drones or assistive robots. In contrast to the conventional methods, in this paper a Non Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) based technique is represented for 3D mapping of the surrounding environment. While in the state of the art techniques, the robot's environment is expressed in a discrete space, the proposed method is mainly developed for representation of environment in a continuous space. Exploiting the information theory, the generated representation has much lower complexity and more compression capability in relation to some state of the art techniques. In addition to representation in a lower dimensional space, the NURBS based representation is invariant against 3D geometric transformations. Furthermore, the NURBS based representation can be employed for obstacle avoidance and navigation. The applicability of the proposed algorithm is investigated in some urban environments through some publicly available data sets. It has been shown by some experiments that the proposed method has better visual representation and much better data compression compared to some state-of-the-art methods. © 2016 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

As the acronym suggests, UAVs are aircraft that do not have an onboard pilot or crew. UAV warfare can be traced back to the late 1800s. Present day UAVs contain complex software and hardware components specialized for numerous facets of military life. The MQ-9 Reaper UAV combines color/monochromatic TV camera, image-intensified camera, infrared sensor, laser illuminator, and a laser ranger finder and designator. From ground controls to satellite communications, this accumulation of technology is a modern-day feat, but it's not immune to design weaknesses. Attackers charging onto the cyber battlefield will exploit any software vulnerabilities. UAVs are mainly used on a wireless network, and data traveling over these wireless channels provides an opportunity for cyber attackers to capture sensitive, highly confidential military information. Attackers can plant viruses, Trojans, and other manifestations of malware into the interconnected communication network. Given this security threat, surveillance data and control commands are often encrypted in an attempt to prevent unauthorized access. While the security vulnerabilities are ever-present and always on the forefront of UAV design and implementation, unmanned vehicles do exhibit considerable benefits to military procedures.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, since the longitudinal dynamic system of unmanned vehicles inherently has the uncertain nonlinearities and time-varying behavior, longitudinal tracking control is reviewed as a challenging work in the exploitation of unmanned vehicles to deal with the features of uncertain nonlinearities and parametric time varying. In this paper, an adaptive nonlinear cascade control architecture is presented to design the longitudinal speed tracking control for unmanned vehicle, which is a nonholonomic system. Firstly, a upper-level model predictive control law is presented to produce a desired and smooth acceleration in real time, and the saturation characteristic is introduced to limit the accelerations within the range of given values. Then, a lower-level adaptive neuro-network sliding mode control (ANN-SMC) law is presented for dynamically tracking the desired acceleration, in which the uncertain term and the variable structure control term are adaptively adjusted by the neuro-networks, and the stability of proposed ANN-SMC control system is proved by the Lyapunov theory.

This problem can be naturally represented as a quantified logical formula of the form: Exists a composition, Forall nondeterministic choices, Uniquely-Exists intermediate and final outputs satisfying a logical specification, that is, an (∃∃!) satisfiability problem. We present a novel approach to solve this problem that exploits the unique-existence of intermediate and final outputs for any given composition and choice values.

This is a critical issue for autonomous vehicles; if compromised in terms of their communications or computation they can cause considerable physical damage due to their mobility. Our aim here is to facilitate the automatic detection of cyber attacks on a robotic vehicle. For this purpose, we have developed a detection mechanism, which monitors real-time data from a large number of sources onboard the vehicle, including its sensors, networks and processing. Following a learning phase, where the vehicle is trained in a non-attack state on what values are considered normal, it is then subjected to a series of different cyber-physical and physical-cyber attacks. We approach the problem as a binary classification problem of whether the robot is able to self-detect when and whether it is under attack. Our experimental results show that the approach is promising for most attacks that the vehicle is subjected to. We further improve its performance by using weights that accentuate the anomalies that are less common thus improving overall performance of the detection mechanism for unknown attacks. © 2016 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The purpose of this work is to propose a framework that automatically annotates the disease labels of multi-source patient data in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). We extract features from two main sources, medical charts and notes. The Bag-of-Words model is used to encode the features. Unlike most of the existing multi-label learning algorithms that globally consider correlations between diseases, our model learns disease correlation locally in the patient data. To achieve this, we derive a local disease correlation representation to enrich the discriminant power of each patient data. This representation is embedded into a unified multi-label learning framework. We develop an alternating algorithm to iteratively optimize the objective function. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a real-world ICU database. We have compared our algorithm with representative multi-label learning algorithms. Evaluation results have shown that our proposed method has state-of-the-art performance in the annotation of multiple diagnostic codes for ICU patients. This study suggests that problems in the automated diagnosis code annotation can be reliably addressed by using a multi-label learning model that exploits disease correlation. The findings of this study will greatly benefit health care and management in ICU considering that the automated diagnosis code annotation can significantly improve the quality and management of health care for both patients and caregivers. © 2017 ACM.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This paper proposes an algorithm for the decentralized coalition formation of multiple heterogeneous UAVs that cooperatively perform a search and attack task to neutralize the static ground targets. The main objective of the proposed algorithm is to determine the smallest coalition that would successfully destroy the target in minimum time. First, the responding UAVs are sorted in the ascending order of their resource difference based cost, and then the eligible sets of UAVs with required total resources that can fulfill the target resource criteria are determined. Second, from the eligible sets of UAVs, the algorithm determines the set with minimum time to neutralize the target based on the time of arrival of UAVs on target. Simulation tests to study the performance of proposed approach are carried out and the results are compared with one of the reference sub optimal decentralized coalition formation approach. The results clearly depict that the proposed approach is more effective and gives near optimal solution for the decentralized coalition formation. © 2016 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, securely admitting a new vehicle into a platoon is an extremely important yet difficult task. There is no adequate method today for verifying physical arrangements of vehicles within a platoon formation. Specifically, we address the problem of a platoon ghost attack wherein an attacker spoofs presence within a platoon to gain admission and subsequently execute malicious attacks. To address such concerns, we present Convoy, a novel autonomous platoon admission scheme which binds the vehicles' digital certificates to their physical context (i.e., locality). Convoy exploits the findings that vehicles traveling together experience similar context to prove to each other over time that they are co-present. Specifically, they experience similar road (e.g., bumps and cracks) and traffic (e.g., acceleration and steering) conditions. Our approach is based on the ability for vehicles to capture this context, generate fingerprints to establish shared keys, and later bind these symmetric keys to their public keys. We design and implement the Convoy protocol and evaluate it with real-world driving data. Our implementation demonstrates that vehicles traveling in adjacent lanes can be sufficiently distinguished by their context and this can be utilized to thwart platoon ghost attacks and similar misbehavior. © 2017 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Military influence meant that the norms surrounding technologies were mainly determined by departments of defense, national governments, and international organizations. Today, technology developers focus more attention on the hundreds of millions of technology users around the world than on the smaller numbers of users within governments and militaries, leaving governments little scope for influence over technologys development and use. Well-known technologies that challenge militaries traditional dominance and threaten their control over technologys uses include autonomous vehicles, cyber technologies, and artificial intelligence. As future generations of consequential technologies mature, perhaps including quantum computing and virtual reality, the challenges faced by governments and militaries will only increase. Because governments and international institutions lack methods to successfully grapple with new or not-yet-developed technologies, societies as a whole must be vigilant to the threats that such technologies pose-and must address the stark imbalance between the resources dedicated to developing new technologies and the resources dedicated to governing them. © 2017 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"Algorithm and software to automatically identify latency and amplitude features of local field potentials recorded in electrophysiological investigation","2017","Source Code for Biology and Medicine","10.1186/s13029-017-0062-5","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011835443&doi=10.1186%2fs13029-017-0062-5&partnerID=40&md5=16f377a761826342ddae6ce49e915d6d","Background: Local field potentials (LFPs) evoked by sensory stimulation are particularly useful in electrophysiological research. For instance, spike timing and current transmembrane current flow estimated from LFPs recorded in the barrel cortex in rats and mice are exploited to investigate how the brain represents sensory stimuli. Recent improvements in microelectrodes technology enable neuroscientists to acquire a great amount of LFPs during the same experimental session, calling for algorithms for their quantitative automatic analysis. Several computer tools were proposed for LFP analysis, but many of them incorporate algorithms that are not open to inspection or modification/personalization. We present a MATLAB software to automatically detect some important LFP features (latency, amplitude, time-derivative value in the inflection-point) for a quantitative analysis. The software features can be customized by the user according to his/her personal research needs. The incorporated algorithm is based on Phillips-Tikhonov regularization to deal with noise amplification due to ill-conditioning. In particular, its accuracy in the estimation of the features of interest is assessed in a Monte Carlo simulation mimicking the acquisition of LFPs in different SNR (signal-to-noise-ratio) conditions. Then, the algorithm is tested by analyzing a real set of 2500 LFPs recorded in rat after whisker stimulation at different depths in the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex, i.e., the region involved in the cortical representation of touch in mammals. Results: Automatic identification of LFP features by the presented software is easy and fast. As far as accuracy is concerned, error indices from simulated data suggest that the algorithm provides reliable estimates. Indeed, results obtained from LFPs recorded in rat after whisker stimulation are in line with the known sequential activation of the microcircuits of the S1 cortex. Conclusion: A MATLAB software implementing an algorithm to automatically detect the main LFPs features was presented. Simulated and real case studies showed that the employed algorithm is accurate and robust against measurement noise. The available code can be used as it is, but the reported description of the algorithms allows users to easily modify the code to cope with specific requirements. © 2017 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

While this methodology has proven to result in near-quantitative labeling of alkyne-tagged precursors, the relatively small size of the fluoroethylazide group makes separation of the 18F-labeled radiotracer and the unreacted precursor challenging, particularly with precursors >500 Da (e.g., peptides). We have developed an inexpensive azide-functionalized resin to rapidly remove unreacted alkyne precursor following the fluoroethylazide labeling reaction and integrated it into a fully automated radiosynthesis platform. We have carried out 2-[18F]fluoroethylazide labeling of four different alkynes ranging from <300 Da to >1700 Da and found that >98% of the unreacted alkyne was removed in less than 20 min at room temperature to afford the final radiotracers at >99% radiochemical purity with specific activities up to >200 GBq/μmol. We have applied this technique to label a novel cyclic peptide previously evolved to bind the Her2 receptor with high affinity, and demonstrated tumor-specific uptake and low nonspecific background by PET/CT.

With the interception system being regarded as threats and transformed into the constraint conditions, the multi-pulse trajectory design is turned into an obstacle avoidance path planning for the unmanned aerial vehicle, wherein the pulse ignition point and interval are regarded as the search nodes and step, respectively. The optimal ignition parameters are selected based on a comprehensive consideration of the detection system delay and the performance and deployment of the interception system. Influence of pulse increment and system delay on multi-pulse trajectory is studied Simulation results show that the proposed strategy can damage the convergence of enemy's prediction algorithm by multi-pulse maneuvering, and the accuracy of hostile warning results is thus reduced. When the enemy's prediction error sufficiently converges and the hostile warning is accurate enough, the missile is already being out of the range of interception. According to the latest information in battlefield, an optimal multi-pulse trajectory can be designed offline in 60 s, which can increase (decrease) the flight altitude and the average flight speed, and shorten (prolong) the flight time by 20%-35%. © 2017, Press of Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.

Flexible membrane wing (FMW) UAVs are seen to be potentials to mitigate these problems. FMWs are adaptable to gusty airflow as the wings are able to flex according to the gust load to reduce the effective angle-of-attack, thus, reducing the aerodynamic loads on the wing. On the other hand, the flexible structure is allowing the UAV to fold in a compact package, and later on, the mini-UAV can be deployed instantly from the storage tube, e.g. through a catapult mechanism. This paper discusses the development of an FMW UAV actuated by a tendon-sheath mechanism (TSM). This approach allows the wing to morph to generate a rolling moment, while still allowing the wing to fold. Dynamic characteristics of the mechanism that exhibits the strong nonlinear phenomenon of friction on TSM are modeled and compensated for. A feed-forward controller was implemented based on the identified nonlinear behavior to control the warping position of the wing. The proposed strategy is validated experimentally in a wind tunnel facility by creating a gusty environment that is imitating a realistic gusty condition based upon the results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. The results demonstrate a stable and robust wing-warping actuation, even in gusty conditions. Accurate wing-warping can be achieved via the TSM, while also allowing the wings to fold. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

In these networks, the vehicles can exchange data by using short-range radio signals in order to get useful information related to traffic conditions, road safety, and other aspects. The availability of different types of sensors can be exploited by the vehicles to measure many parameters from their surroundings. These data can then be shared with other drivers who, on the other side, could also explicitly submit queries to retrieve information available in the network. This can be a challenging task, since the data is scattered among the vehicles belonging to the network and the communication links among them have usually a short life due to their constant movement. In this paper, we use mobile agent technology to help to accomplish these tasks, since mobile agents have a number of features that are very well suited for mobile environments, such as autonomy, mobility, and intelligence. Specifically, we analyze the benefits that mobile agents can bring to vehicular networks and the potential difficulties for their adoption. Moreover, we describe a query processing approach based on the use of mobile agents.

Given the regular use of combustible material by campers and the frequent use of campfires to cook, campsites become areas with a high propensity for the occurrence of fires. Moreover, fires occurring close to campsites can cause evacuations, disturbing their regular activities and jeopardizing tourism and likewise economic activities. While some campsites have tents and caravans within a secure distance of each other, many other campsites have the tents and caravans very concentrated in a limited area, making it much easier for fire to spread from a tent to the next. Despite the occurrence of several of these events, the associated risk is currently not well studied or documented. The work presented in this paper was performed within the Portuguese research project FireCamp, whose main purpose was the analysis and documentation of the fire risk in campsites. Several topics were addressed and some of them will be presented within this paper, specifically: (1) understanding of the mechanisms associated to burning tents; (2) analysis of the combustibility of typical accessories used in campsites such as tents, sleeping bags or camping mattresses; (3) characterization of a campsite fuel cover and its surroundings via image analysis taken by unmanned aerial vehicles; and (4) modeling of fire spread in campsites. A pilot study was carried out between 2011 and 2014 in the Campsite of Côja, in Arganil—Coimbra—Portugal. Taking into consideration that external fires frequently threaten these sites, complementary to the analysis of the fuel distribution inside the campsite, the land use analysis in the surrounding area is also of great interest. Thus, a fuel map of the Campsite of Côja was produced based on a high-resolution map of the area obtained by aerial photography produced by drones. Based on this fuel map, a stochastic model was set up to predict the fire spread in the covered area. The results obtained in this pilot study are hereby presented. Additionally, several laboratory tests were carried out in order to analyze the high calorific values (HCV) and the time to ignition (TTI) of the materials of typical camping accessories. The values of HCV found are in the range of 22.45–45.45 MJ kg−1 and the values of TTI found are in the range of 118–224 s. These values show a high propensity for these materials to spread fire. Real tents with and without typical accessories inside (e.g., sleeping bags) were burnt in controlled environment in order to determine the mass loss decay, the increase of temperature and the convective airflows produced. Due to the convective flow inside the tent, these parameters were not considered as valid but these tests were important to understand the mechanisms associated to the burning of tents and the risk associated. The presence of combustible material inside a tent was found to be of high importance in order to sustain the combustion. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Firstly, in order to design the appropriate controller, path following error dynamics model is constructed in a moving Serret–Frenet frame, and the five degrees of freedom (DOFs) dynamic model with multiple uncertainties is established. Secondly, the proposed control law is separated into kinematic controller and dynamic controller via back-stepping technique. In the case of kinematic controller, to overcome the drawback of dependence on the accurate vehicle model that are present in a number of path following control strategies described in the literature, the unknown side-slip angular velocity and attack angular velocity are treated as uncertainties. Whereas in the case of dynamic controller, the model parameters perturbations, unknown external environmental disturbances and the nonlinear hydrodynamic damping terms are treated as lumped uncertainties. Both kinematic and dynamic uncertainties are estimated and compensated by designed reduced-order linear extended state observes (LESOs). Thirdly, feedback linearization (FL) based control law is implemented for the control model using the estimates generated by reduced-order LESOs. For handling the problem of computational complexity inherent in the conventional back-stepping method, nonlinear tracking differentiators (NTDs) are applied to construct derivatives of the virtual control commands. Finally, the closed loop stability for the overall system is established. Simulation and comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed controller exhibits enhanced performance in the presence of internal parameter variations, external unknown disturbances, unmodeled nonlinear damping terms, and measurement noises. © 2017 ISA","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this context, the inherent characteristics of Ambient Intelligence (AmI), transparency and intelligence, have turned it into one of the best approaches to square up to the impairment that ABI can cause. As AmI proposes the development of context-aware systems that integrate different devices to recognize the context and act accordingly, these systems can react promptly to the needs of people with ABI while they carry out their rehabilitation process. Moreover, the exploitation of a Multi-Agent architecture emerges as a natural solution to develop AmI systems, since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. Therefore, in this paper, a Multi-Agent architecture (MAS) for healthcare AmI systems is presented. It contributes to treat people with ABI by using specific devices to control the patient's movements and some physiological responses, such as the variation of the heart rate, during her rehabilitation process. In this way, the natural relationship between AmI and MAS is exploited.

We propose a novel controller for vehicle platooning based on consensus and analytically demonstrate its stability and dynamic properties. Traditional approaches assume the logical control topology as a constraint fixed a priori, and the control law is designed consequently; our approach makes the control topology a design parameter that can be exploited to reconfigure the controller, depending on the needs and characteristics of the scenario. Furthermore, the controller automatically compensates outdated information caused by network losses and delays. The controller is implemented in Plexe, which is a state-of-the-art IVC and mobility simulator that includes basic building blocks for platooning. Analysis and simulations show the controller robustness and performance in several scenarios, including realistic propagation conditions with interference caused by other vehicles. We compare our approach against a controller taken from the literature, which is generally considered among the most performing ones. Finally, we test the proposed controller by implementing the real dynamics (engine, transmission, braking systems, etc.) of heterogeneous vehicles in Plexe and verifying that platoons remain stable and safe, regardless of real-life impairments that cannot be modeled in the analytic solution. The results show the ability of the proposed approach to maintain a stable string of realistic vehicles with different control-communication topologies, even in the presence of strong interference, delays, and fading conditions, providing higher comfort and safety for platoon drivers. © 2016 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

For example, the proposed threat could result in hand-written digits on a scanned check being incorrectly classified but looking normal when humans see them. This research assesses the extent to which adversarial examples pose a security threat, when one considers the normal image acquisition process. This process is mimicked by simulating the transformations that normally occur in acquiring the image in a real world application, such as using a scanner to acquire digits for a check amount or using a camera in an autonomous car. These small transformations negate the effect of the carefully crafted perturbations of adversarial examples, resulting in a correct classification by the deep neural network. Thus just acquiring the image decreases the potential impact of the proposed security threat. We also show that the already widely used process of averaging over multiple crops neutralizes most adversarial examples. Normal preprocessing, such as text binarization, almost completely neutralizes adversarial examples. This is the first paper to show that for text driven classification, adversarial examples are an academic curiosity, not a security threat. © 2016 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Recently, consumer demands for connectivity (e.g., infotainment, car-2-car or car-2-infrastructure communication) as well as new advances toward advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or even autonomous driving functions make cybersecurity another key factor to be taken into account by vehicle suppliers and manufacturers. Although these can capitalize on experiences from many other domains, they still have to face several unique challenges when gearing up for specific cybersecurity challenges. A key challenge is related to the increasing interconnection of automotive systems with networks (such as Car2X). Due to this connectivity, it is no longer acceptable to assume that safety-critical systems are immune to security risks. Consequently novel automotive systems require appropriate systematic approaches to support security and safety aware development. Traditionally, safety and security have been treated separately, however due to increasing awareness of the mutual impacts, an integrated view based on cross domain knowledge becomes more important. The recently released SAE J3061 guidebook for cyber-physical vehicle systems provides high-level principles for automotive organizations for identifying and assessing cybersecurity threats and for designing cybersecurity aware systems in close relation to the ISO 26262 standard for the functional safety of road vehicles. The focus of this paper is set on addressing system safety and cybersecurity in combination rather than independently, and thereby raise the awareness of their mutual impacts.

This is a consequence of the feeding of malicious sensor measurements to the controller and the collision avoidance module built into the system. This is an instance of the broader concern of cybersecurity vulnerabilities opened up by the increasing integration of critical physical infrastructures with the cyber system. We consider a solution based on 'dynamic watermarking' of signals to detect and stop such attacks on cyber-physical systems. We show how dynamic watermarking can handle nonlinearities arising in vehicular models. We then experimentally demonstrate that employing this nonlinear extension indeed restores the property of collision freedom even in the presence of attacks. © 2016 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Since the conventional computer security techniques are unable to assure the underlying physical behavior against cyber attacks, this paper considers the safety of the compromised CPS from a controls domain perspective. Specifically, we propose an on-line algorithm to assess the safety of the CPS in the presence of stealthy cyber attacks which can be designed intelligently to avoid detection. The main idea is based on a reachability analysis that computes the reachable set of CPS states possibly reached by all potential stealthy cyber attacks. The reachable set computation typically demands a large computation cost and has mostly relied on the approximation techniques. However, our algorithm analytically derives the exact reachable set solution and further establishes a recursive computation structure that can perform in the real-time CPS operation. This significantly enhances the quality of the on-line safety assessment, enabling more reliable, less conservative, and computationally efficient process. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated with an illustrative example of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) application. © 2016 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Since the linear models used for identification from flight data at low and moderate angles of attack become unsuitable for accurate parameter estimation at high angles of attack, a non-linear aerodynamic model has to be considered. Therefore, the Kirchhoff's flow separation model was used to incorporate the non-linearity in the aerodynamic model in terms of flow separation point and stall characteristic parameters. The Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Neural Gauss-Newton (NGN) methods were used to perform the parameter estimation on one set of low angle-of-attack and one set of near-stall flight data. It is evident from the estimates that the NGN method, which does not involve solving equations of motion, performs on a par with the classical ML method. This may be attributed to the reason that NGN method uses a neural network which has been trained by performing point to point mapping of the measured flight data. This feature of NGN method enhances its application over a wider envelope of high angles of attack flight data. © 2017 Royal Aeronautical Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In such cooperative missions, if the detecting UAV does not have enough resources to neutralize a target then a coalition of UAVs may needs to be formed that fulfills the target resource requirement. This coalition formation is computationally complex due to the combinatorial nature of the problem and is NP-Hard. Therefore, solutions with low computational complexity are required. The proposed decentralized coalition formation algorithm is sub-optimal and is computationally less complex. The proposed algorithm is based on the resource match cost criteria, in which the algorithm iteratively selects the final coalition members from the responding UAVs which are closest in resource match to the target resource requirement. After the selection of every single coalition member, the new resource match cost on the basis of new target resource requirement is calculated for the remaining responding UAVs and the above procedure is repeated until the target resource requirement is satisfied. The main objective of the algorithm is that, the coalition formed must be of minimum size and closest in match to the target resource requirement, so that more UAVs and resources must remain available for the search of other targets. The proposed solution enables the UAVs to form parallel coalitions to neutralize multiple targets and to utilize their resources more effectively. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through simulation tests and the results are compared with one of the reference sub-optimal decentralized coalition formation algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm is more effective and determines the near optimal set of member UAVs for the decentralized coalition formation. However, the proposed algorithm is naive with less computational complexity and can produce sub-optimal solutions which in most cases are near optimal. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The mission planning method includes mission allocation based on ant colony optimization (ACO) and path planning based on improved Dubins path. First, the multiple targets attacking problem is transformed to an optimization problem. Second, to make the method more applicative for real battlefield, several common constraints are considered in the optimization problem. The constraints of mission allocation mainly include the UAVs' executive ability, flight range, targets' threat degree and attack profit, etc. The constraints of path planning mainly include the minimum turning radius and length of path. To meet the goal of optimization of multiple performance indexes, comprehensive performance index is designed. Moreover, the Dubins path is adopted to generate flight paths for every UAV. And some improvement of Dubins path is made to fit the path planning problem. The improved Dubins path is easier to be calculated and shorter than the original Dubins path. Finally, an example of multiple UAVs attacking multiple ground targets is carried out to verify the feasibility of strategies for mission planning.

Electronic health records enable automated identification of people at risk but not receiving treatment. We investigated the effectiveness of a software tool (AURAS-AF [Automated Risk Assessment for Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation]) designed to identify such individuals during routine care through a cluster-randomized trial. Methods - Screen reminders appeared each time the electronic health records of an eligible patient was accessed until a decision had been taken over OAC treatment. Where OAC was not started, clinicians were prompted to indicate a reason. Control practices continued usual care. The primary outcome was the proportion of eligible individuals receiving OAC at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included rates of cardiovascular events and reports of adverse effects of the software on clinical decision-making. Results - Forty-seven practices were randomized. The mean proportion-prescribed OAC at 6 months was 66.3% (SD=9.3) in the intervention arm and 63.9% (9.5) in the control arm (adjusted difference 1.21% [95% confidence interval -0.72 to 3.13]). Incidence of recorded transient ischemic attack was higher in the intervention practices (median 10.0 versus 2.3 per 1000 patients with atrial fibrillation; P=0.027), but at 12 months, we found a lower incidence of both all cause stroke (P=0.06) and hemorrhage (P=0.054). No adverse effects of the software were reported. Conclusions - No significant change in OAC prescribing occurred. A greater rate of diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (possibly because of improved detection or overdiagnosis) was associated with a reduction (of borderline significance) in stroke and hemorrhage over 12 months.

Through the coordinated down-regulation of biosynthetic, proliferative and electrogenic expenditures at times when little ATP can be generated, a metabolism turned ‘down to the pilot light’ allows the re-balancing of energy demand with supply at a greatly suppressed level in response to noxious exogenous stimuli or seasonal endogenous cues. A unifying hallmark of stress-tolerant organisms, the adaptation effectively prevents lethal depletion of ATP, thus delineating a marked contrast with susceptible species. Along with disengaged macromolecular syntheses, attenuated transmembrane ion shuttling and PO2-conforming respiration rates, the metabolic slowdown in tolerant species usually culminates in a non-cycling, quiescent phenotype. However, such a reprogramming also occurs in leading human pathophysiologies. Ranging from microbial infections through ischaemia-driven infarcts to solid malignancies, cells involved in these disorders may again invoke hypometabolism to endure conditions non-permissive for growth. At the same time, their reduced activities underlie the frequent development of a general resistance to therapeutic interventions. On the other hand, a controlled induction of hypometabolic and/or hypothermic states by pharmacological means has recently stimulated intense research aimed at improved organ preservation and patient survival in situations requiring acutely administered critical care. The current review article therefore presents an up-to-date survey of concepts and applications of a coordinated and reversibly down-regulated metabolic rate as the ultimate defence in stress responses. © 2016 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

Patients and Methods: In this study we assessed the effect of epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel (EC-Doc) on the QTc interval in 10 patients with early breast cancer. Cardiac toxicity was assessed with symptoms, transthoracic echocardiography, electrocardiography (ECG), and serum cardiac markers at baseline and after 4 cycles of EC and 4 cycles of docetaxel. To evaluate the influence of interobserver variation, the QTc interval was analyzed by a cardiologist, a gynecologist, and with automated ECG interpretation software. Results: There was a significant QTc prolongation after EC treatment independent of the investigator. In addition, a significant increase in N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels was noted after EC treatment. QTc prolongation and NT-proBNP levels normalized after docetaxel treatment. Other biochemical markers were within normal ranges. No clinically relevant effect on left ventricular ejection fraction was observed. Conclusion: This prospective study demonstrated that EC treatment increases the QTc interval and NT-proBNP levels in women with early breast cancer. This effect was reversible and independent of docetaxel administration. Moreover, the treating physician can safely perform QTc interval evaluation as part of clinical routine independent of his/her specialty.

Uncleared landmines represent a major humanitarian and economic threat in over 70 countries. Its victims suffer from permanent disability if not killed and require horrific expensive care. Also, the cost of the land, roads, and underground resources that remains useless. Clearing mines is very dangerous work. The majority of demining work is still carried out manually using metal detectors and prodders. For every 5,000 mines that are removed, one person is killed and two people are injured. Over the years there has been considerable interest within the scientific and engineering communities in the application of advanced technologies to improve the safety and efficiency of this work. In this paper a motion-planning algorithm to enable landmine detection and clearing robots to systematically scan a minefield, detect landmines and clear it is presented. The algorithm works on two steps; (1) generate the driving tracks that can be used to scan the minefield area, and (2) connect these tracks using Dubins' path in order to generate a continues and complete trajectory which can be used for the robot's navigation. The inputs to the algorithm are the coordinates of the outer boundaries of the minefield's vertices, the operating width of the robot, the minimum turning radius of the robot/autonomous vehicle, the required (or optimized) driving angle in the field, and the robot's entrance point to the minefield. The output is a trajectory that consists of the coordinates of a number of headland paths connected using Dubins' curves and a set of parallel tracks covering the entire minefield area connected using Dubins' curves. The resultant trajectory enables the robot to scan the minefield area in the shortest time in a way that prevents missing any landmine by scanning the entire field area. It also enables the robot to work fully autonomous with minimal or without human intervention at all and therefore it dramatically reduces risks of workplace injury and maximize operation efficiency. © 2016 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The Pentagon's Joint Improvised Threat Defeat Organization (JIDO), the same group that developed counter-improvised explosive device capabilities, began following the drone threat in late 2013. The RFP calls for a handheld device that must be able to disrupt or manage the radio frequency link between a commercial UAS and the pilot and be able to passively detect RF signatures to aid the user in detecting and locating UASs. As potential adversaries pursue counter-UAS technologies, the US military will need to develop means for its RPAs to defend themselves.

We therefore examined the quality of BLS education and AED installation in schools. Methods: We conducted a prefecture-wide questionnaire survey of all primary and junior high schools in 2016, to assess BLS education and AED installation against the recommendations of the Japan Circulation Society. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-squared test. Results: In total, 195 schools out of 315 (62%) responded, of which 38% have introduced BLS education for children. BLS training was held in a smaller proportion of primary schools (18%) than junior high schools (86%). More than 90% of primary school staff had undergone BLS training in the previous 2 years. The most common locations of AED were the gymnasium (32%) followed by entrance hall (28%), staffroom (25%), and infirmary (12%). The reasons given for location were that it was obvious (34%), convenient for staff (32%), could be used out of hours (17%), and the most likely location for a heart attack (15%). Approximately 18% of schools reported that it takes >5 min to reach the AED from the furthest point. Conclusion: BLS training, AED location, and understanding of both are not sufficient to save children's lives efficiently. Authorities should make recommendations about the correct number of AED, and their location, and provide more information to improve the quality of BLS training in schools. © 2016 Japan Pediatric Society","Article","Final","Scopus"

EVs also serve as dissemination vehicles for pathogens, including prions, proteinaceous infectious agents that cause transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in mammals. Increasing evidence accumulates that diverse protein aggregates associated with common neurodegenerative diseases are packaged into EVs as well. Vesicle-mediated intercellular transmission of protein aggregates can induce aggregation of homotypic proteins in acceptor cells and might thereby contribute to disease progression. Our knowledge of how protein aggregates are sorted into EVs and how these vesicles adhere to and fuse with target cells is limited. Here we review how TSE prions exploit EVs for intercellular transmission and compare this to the transmission behavior of self-templating cytosolic protein aggregates derived from the yeast prion domain Sup 35 NM. Artificial NM prions are non-toxic to mammalian cell cultures and do not cause loss-of-function phenotypes. Importantly, NM particles are also secreted in association with exosomes that horizontally transmit the prion phenotype to naive bystander cells, a process that can be monitored with high accuracy by automated high throughput confocal microscopy. The high abundance of mammalian proteins with amino acid stretches compositionally similar to yeast prion domains makes the NM cell model an attractive model to study self-templating and dissemination properties of proteins with prion-like domains in the mammalian context. © 2017 The Author(s).

Quantitative analysis of WMLs in large clinical trials is crucial in scientific investigations of such neurological diseases as well as in studying aging processes. Exploiting the different appearances of WMLs in multiple modalities, we propose a novel coarse classification to region-scalable refining method to segment WMLs in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences without user intervention. Specifically, a nonlinear voxel-wise classifier is trained based on intensity features extracted from multimodality MRI sequences, and tissues’ probabilistic prior provided by partial volume estimate images in native space. By considering the prior that the WMLs almost exist in white matter, a rejection algorithm is then used to eliminate the false-positive labels from the initial coarse classification. To further segment precise lesions boundary and detect missing lesions, a region-scalable refining is finally employed to effectively segment the WMLs based on the previous initial contour. Compared with the manual segmentation results from an experienced neuroradiologist, the segmentations for real images of our proposal show desirable performances and high accuracy and provide competitive solution with stateof-the-art methods. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.","Review","Final","Scopus"

This paper exploits the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for outdoor data acquisition and conducts accuracy assessment tests to explore potential usage for offsite inspection of transmission lines. Firstly, an oblique photogrammetric system, integrating with a cheap double-camera imaging system, an onboard dual-frequency GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiver and a ground master GNSS station in fixed position, is designed to acquire images with ground resolutions better than 3 cm. Secondly, an image orientation method, considering oblique imaging geometry of the dual-camera system, is applied to detect enough tie-points to construct stable image connection in both along-track and across-track directions. To achieve the best geo-referencing accuracy and evaluate model measurement precision, signalized ground control points (GCPs) and model key points have been surveyed. Finally, accuracy assessment tests, including absolute orientation precision and relative model precision, have been conducted with different GCP configurations. Experiments show that images captured by the designed photogrammetric system contain enough information of power pylons from different viewpoints. Quantitative assessment demonstrates that, with fewer GCPs for image orientation, the absolute and relative accuracies of image orientation and model measurement are better than 0.3 and 0.2 m, respectively. For regular inspection of transmission lines, the proposed solution can to some extent be an alternative method with competitive accuracy, lower operational complexity and considerable gains in economic cost. © 2017 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The article outlines the project and its objectives and the importance of determining whether IP addresses can be lawfully shared as cyber threat intelligence. The goal of the project is to enhance cyber-threat intelligence sharing throughout the cyber ecosystem. The findings and recommendations from this project enable businesses to navigate the international legal environment and develop their policy and procedures to enable timely, effective and legal sharing of cyber-threat information. The project is the first of its kind in the world. It is unique in both focus and scope. Unlike the cyber-threat information sharing reviews and initiatives being developed at country and regional levels, the focus of this project and this article is on business-to-business sharing. The scope of this project in terms of the 34 jurisdictions reviewed as to their data protection requirements is more comprehensive than any similar study to date. This article focuses on the sharing of IP addresses as cyber threat intelligence in the context of the new European Union (EU) data protection initiatives agreed in December 2015 and formally adopted by the European Council and Parliament in April 2016. The new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to EU member countries, a major focus of the international cyber threat sharing project. The research also reveals that EU data protection requirements, particularly the currently applicable law of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (1995 Directive) (the rules of which the GDPR will replace in practice in 2018), generally form the basis of current data protection requirements in countries outside Europe. It is expected that this influence will continue and that the GDPR will shape the development of data protection internationally. In this article, the authors examine whether static and dynamic IP addresses are “personal data” as defined in the GDPR and its predecessor the 1995 Directive that is currently the model for data protection in many jurisdictions outside Europe. The authors then consider whether sharing of that data by a business without the consent of the data subject, can be justified in the public interest so as to override individual rights under Articles 7 and 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which underpin EU data protection. The analysis shows that the sharing of cyber threat intelligence is in the public interest so as to override the rights of a data subject, as long as it is carried out in ways that are strictly necessary in order to achieve security objectives. The article concludes by summarizing the project findings to date, and how they inform international sharing of cyber-threat intelligence within the private sector. © 2017 Clare Sullivan & Eric Burger","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this case study of the Mobile Technology for Health (MOTECH) program in Ghana, we assess the platform's effectiveness in delivering messages, along with user response across sites in five districts from 2011 to 2014. Methods: MOTECH is comprised of ""Client Data Application (CDA) which allows providers to digitize and track service delivery information for women and infants and ""Mobile Midwife"" (MM) which sends automated educational voice messages to the mobile phones of pregnant and postpartum women. Using a naturalist study design, we draw upon system generated data to evaluate message delivery, client engagement, and provider responsiveness to MOTECH over time and by level of facility. Results: A total of 7,370 women were enrolled in MM during pregnancy and 14,867 women were enrolled postpa1rtum. While providers were able to register and upload patient-level health information using CDA, the majority of these uploads occurred in Community-based facilities versus Health Centers. For MM, 25% or less of expected messages were received by pregnant women, despite the majority (>77%) owning a private mobile phone. While over 80% of messages received by pregnant women were listened to, postpartum rates of listening declined over time. Only 25% of pregnant women received and listened to at least 1 first trimester message. By 6-12 months postpartum, less than 6% of enrolled women were exposed to at least one message. Conclusions: Caution should be exercised in assuming that digital health programs perform as intended. Evaluations should measure the technological, behavioral, health systems, and/or community factors which may lead to breaks in the impact pathway and influence findings on effectiveness. The MOTECH platform's technological limitations in 'pushing' out voice messages highlights the need for more timely use of data to mitigate delivery challenges and improve exposure to health information. Alternative message delivery channels (USSD or SMS) could improve the platform's ability to deliver messages but may not be appropriate for illiterate users.

In this paper, a multiple unmanned combat aerial vehicle (multi-UCAV) cooperative autonomous attack path planning method under complex and uncertain environment is put forward. A general framework of multi-UCAV cooperative combat and autonomous attack is designed. Then, the relative movement situation of the UCAV formation is studied and the task assignment model for attacking multi-target is established. On this basis, an improved ant colony algorithm (ACA) is used to solve the corresponding optimal problem. By taking the three degrees of freedom model of UCAV as a core and considering various constraints such as aerodynamic characteristics, thrust variation, target projection area and threat area, an accurate cooperative autonomous attack path planning model for multi-UCAV is built and an improved rolling pseudospectral method(RPM) is applied to calculate the optimal trajectory from the current location to the launch acceptable region. Simulation results show that the proposed ACA and RPM can deal with the task assignment and path planning of multi-UCAV effectively, and they have higher precision and better real-time compared with some existed methods. © 2016 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Recently, advances in the field of image processing and UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) have resulted in a renewed interest in this technique. However, commercially ready-to-use UAVs are often equipped with smaller sensors in order to minimize payload and the quality of the documentation is still an issue. In this research, two commercial UAVs (the Sensefly Albris and DJI Phantom 3 Professional) were setup to record the 19th century St-Pierre-le-Jeune church in Strasbourg, France. Several software solutions (commercial and open source) were used to compare both UAVs' images in terms of calibration, accuracy of external orientation, as well as dense matching. Results show some instability in regards to the calibration of Phantom 3, while the Albris had issues regarding its aerotriangulation results. Despite these shortcomings, both UAVs succeeded in producing dense point clouds of up to a few centimeters in accuracy, which is largely sufficient for the purposes of a city 3D GIS (Geographical Information System). The acquisition of close range images using UAVs also provides greater LoD flexibility in processing. These advantages over other methods such as the TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanning) or terrestrial close range photogrammetry can be exploited in order for these techniques to complement each other.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Along with providing coverage over difficult terrain, it provides better spectral utilization through 3D spatial reuse. However, being a wireless network, 3D meshes are vulnerable to jamming/disruptive attacks. A jammer can disrupt the communication, as well as control of the network by intelligently causing interference to a set of nodes. This paper presents a distributed mechanism of avoiding jamming attacks by means of 3D spatial filtering where adaptive beam nulling is used to keep the jammer in null region in order to bypass jamming. Kalman filter based tracking mechanism is used to estimate the most likely trajectory of the jammer from noisy observation of the jammer's position. A beam null border is determined by calculating confidence region of jammer's current and next position estimates. An optimization goal is presented to calculate optimal beam null that minimizes the number of deactivated links while maximizing the higher value of confidence for keeping the jammer inside the null.

Methods Retrospective analysis of the related data of the adult AAD patients diagnosed by imaging examination, and admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from March 2010 to July 2016 was performed. The onset time, the contemporaneous meteorological data, including daily minimum, average, and the highest temperature, daily average air pressure, daily average relative humidity, daily precipitation, daily average wind speed, daily maximum wind speed, and sunshine duration per day were collected. Analysis of concentrated distribution trend of the AAD onset was done by circular distribution statistics. Meteorological conditions were compared between ""the AAD day"" and ""no AAD day"". The changes of air temperature 5 days before onset were observed. Results A total of 379 patients were enrolled, with 307 male and 72 female. The ratio of male to female was 4.19: 1, the average age was 52.27± 12.18; and the underlying diseases was hypertension (about 58.05%); the incidence sites were Urumqi and Changji city. (1) The incidence of AAD in Urumqi and its peripheral areas had clear concentrated trend, and the peak period of AAD corresponded to January 1st to 2nd (homogeneity test r = 0.104, r0.05 = 0.009, P < 0.05).

(3) the peak period of AAD occurrence was December (38 cases), which was followed by January (36 cases); and there were 26 cases of each month in May, June, July, and September, which were lower than the rest of months. It was shown by the temperature distribution that the minimum average temperature was in January (-12.46°C), followed by December (-9.03°C); the maximum average temperature was in July [(24.59 ± 3.21)°C], followed by August [(23.14 ± 3.64)°C]. (4) The patients was sorted according to the quartile of daily mean temperature, into < -5.2°C, -5.2-10.7°C, 10.7-20.4°C, and > 20.4°C groups, and each group had 104, 99, 98, 78 cases of AAD, respectively. The number of AAD in lowest temperature group was 1.33 times of the highest temperature group. In the 45-59 and 60-74 years, the number of AAD in lowest temperature group was higher than that in the highest temperature group (50 vs. 36, 26 vs. 13). In patients with hypertension, the number of AAD in lowest temperature group was higher than that in the highest temperature group (60 vs. 44). (5) The maximum air temperature, mean air temperature of the day from 5 days before to the onset day of AAD, and the lowest temperature from 3 days before to the onset day of AAD display slowly decrease trends, but there was no significant difference in daily temperature. Conclusions The incidence of AAD in Urumqi and its peripheral areas was concentrated from January 1st to 2nd of each year. When the temperature was lower than -5.2°C, AAD were more likely to attack. The 5 days changes of temperature and daily temperature before the attack were relevant with onset of AAD. It was speculated that the weather conditions such as air temperature may affect patient who has a past history of cardiovascular disease to attack AAD. © 2017 Heilongjiang Institute of Science and Technology Information.

The aim of these tests is to easily and reliably distinguish between real human users and (malicious) bots. The approach underlying FATCHA is to exploit real time capture of human actions instead of human ability to recognize visual or auditory items. The latter approach explicitly requires proposing a challenge difficult for an automatic responder but easy for a human. However, it is often the case that pursuing the first feature takes to lose the second one. Moreover the user task may be hindered by specific disabilities. According to FATCHA approach the system rather asks the user to carry out some trivial gesture, e.g., rotating or moving the head. The webcam, which is available in almost all computers or mobile devices, captures the user gesture, and the server (hosting the service to protect) matches it with the requested one. It is possible to extend the service with a second module that allows the user to authenticate himself by face recognition instead of using a password. On the contrary, FATCHA gesture challenge can be used as a liveliness test to avoid biometric spoofing. Multimodal interaction is the base for both an advanced Human Interactive Proof (HIP) test and for robust/comfortable authentication. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Article","Final","Scopus"

With the rapid development of information technology, the development of three-dimensional underwater acoustic sensor networks (3D UASNs) provides a novel strategy to acquire marine environment information conveniently, efficiently and accurately. However, the specific propagation effects of acoustic communication channel lead to decreased successful information delivery probability with increased distance. Therefore, we investigate two probabilistic neighborhood-based data collection algorithms for 3D UASNs which are based on a probabilistic acoustic communication model instead of the traditional deterministic acoustic communication model. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is employed to traverse along the designed path to collect data from neighborhoods. For 3D UASNs without prior deployment knowledge, partitioning the network into grids can allow the AUV to visit the central location of each grid for data collection. For 3D UASNs in which the deployment knowledge is known in advance, the AUV only needs to visit several selected locations by constructing a minimum probabilistic neighborhood covering set to reduce data latency. Otherwise, by increasing the transmission rounds, our proposed algorithms can provide a tradeoff between data collection latency and information gain. These algorithms are compared with basic Nearest-neighbor Heuristic algorithm via simulations. Simulation analyses show that our proposed algorithms can efficiently reduce the average data collection completion time, corresponding to a decrease of data latency. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In spite of numerous prevention methodologies being used today, web applications still tend to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Technology has improved drastically over the past few years and computers have certainly brought a great impact on our lifestyle. The computer applications and their usage over the web are myriad. It is quite evident that the in the near future, the usage of computers would relatively be higher than what we are witnessing today. A wide variety of data such as credit information, military data, human communication data, and countless types of data is shared over the far-flung computer networks. As the usage and reliability on computers increase, the threat to sensitive data likewise increases. The challenges with the cyber security when dealing with sensitive information is now a nightmare. To help understand the threats and the severity of exploits deployed, the paper provides proof of concepts for exploits carried out to compromise web applications and how the databases are exploited using the SQL injection methodologies. The SQL injection vulnerabilities in the web applications are surprisingly very vast and this is definitely is a huge security threat to personal data of people that is stored on web. In this paper, the methods used in information gathering, how the security is breached, and how payloads are used to exploit web applications are explained using the Kali Linux. In addition, an analysis is carried out on how the websites are comprised. Advanced methods on how to defend SQL injections are briefly justified.

Self-driving vehicles and cellular dongles plugged into the OBD-II port were not anticipated. Researchers have shown that the cellular modem on an OBD-II dongle may be hacked, allowing the attacker to tamper with the vehicle brakes. ADAS, self-driving features and other vehicle functions may be vulnerable as well. The industry must balance the interests of multiple stakeholders including Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who are required to provide OBD function, repair shops which have a legitimate need to access the OBD functions, dongle providers and drivers. OEMs need the ability to protect drivers and manage liability by limiting how a device or software application may modify the operation of a vehicle. This paper outlines a technical approach based upon cryptographic authentication and granular access control policy which addresses the needs of stakeholders. This allows the OEM to protect the security of the vehicle by carefully controlling the functions a particular device plugged into the OBD-II port is able to perform. This allows device makers (diagnostic tools, insurance dongles, etc.) to have their products certified to work with the OEM’s vehicles.

Via a handheld monocular display, participants received a route map and sensor imagery from the vehicle that was ∼20-50 m ahead. Twenty-two male participants were divided into two groups, with or without the sensor imagery. Each participant navigated for 2 km in a military urban terrain training facility, while encountering civilians, moving and stationary suspects, and improvised explosive devices. The OODA loop (observe-orient-decide-act) framework was used to examine soldiers' decisions. The experimental group was slower to respond to threats and to orient. They also reported higher workload, more difficulties in allocating their attention to the environment, and more frustration. These can be partially attributed to the novelty of the technological capability, but also to its implementation in the study. The breakdown of performance metrics into the OODA loop components enabled analysis of the major difficulties in the decision-making process.

These obstacles can be a hindrance to MAV flight, but also have the potential to generate orographic updrafts when wind impinges on them. In theory, MAVs can exploit these updrafts in order to conserve power. However, finding, navigating between, and utilizing these updrafts is a significant challenge. We explore three aspects of this urban soaring challenge: updraft prediction and sensing, path-planning, and control. In an effort to predict urban updrafts, large-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of various environments have been performed. These are then combined with real-time flow field data from several multi-hole pressure probes attached to the MAV to produce better estimates of the current updraft field. The CFD results are used in large-scale path-planning through the use of a randomized planning algorithm to plan energy-efficient paths through known environments. Finally, a demonstration of ""wind-hovering"" in an orographic updraft using a simplified trajectory determination algorithm and control system is presented. Our vision is an autonomous platform that utilizes a database of flows around canonical shapes, together with a map, and feedback from flow sensors, to effectively navigate between urban soaring locations and maintain prolonged soaring flight. © 2016 Engineers Australia.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Among the typical tools exploited to perform the cited operations the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) represent a validated and reliable technology. These vehicles are typically equipped with properly selected sensors that collect data from the surveyed environment. This data can be employed to detect and recognize targets of interest, such as manmade artifacts located on the seabed, both in an online or offline modality.

Several semi-quantitative scores have been defined in order to provide researchers with a standardized framework for the offline assessment of the microcirculation status. Among those, space-time diagrams (STDs) constitute an established method for obtaining an estimate of the red blood cells (RBCs) flow velocity in capillaries. However, STDs have the drawback of being time-consuming, inherently subjective, and difficult to manage when the flow is not regular. Objective. In this work we propose an automated method for calculating erythrocyte flow speed, aiming to provide a fast and objective tool for the evaluation of peripheral blood perfusion. Approach. The proposed method exploits an image segmentation module for estimating the positions of candidate flowing cells. A multi-object tracking algorithm based on Kalman filters analyzes and matches the positions corresponding to specific erythrocytes within consecutive frames. Thus, the output of the filter enables to estimate the displacement of each cell, yielding their instantaneous speed. Main results. The method has been validated against the results obtained by the manual analysis of STDs, proving a good agreement for speeds up to 300 μm s-1. At higher speeds, RBC tracking becomes unstable due to the currently limited video acquisition rate (25 Hz) of state-of-the-art devices, that makes the matching between objects appearing in consecutive frames very challenging. © 2017 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In molecular terms, MBCs usually cluster with triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), but have a worse prognosis than TNBCs. Studies investigating MBCs for specific biomarkers of therapy response are rare and limited by the methodological approaches. The aim of the present study was to characterise MBCs on a molecular level and test programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) biomarker expression in MBCs for future therapeutic interventions. Methods We profiled 297 samples (MBC (n=75), TNBC (n=106), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancers (n=32) and hormone-positive breast cancers (n=84)) by next-generation sequencing. Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) expression was performed using automated procedures. Results The most commonly mutated genes in MBCs included TP53 (56%) and PIK3CA (23%). Pathogenic mutations in other genes, including HRAS, FBXW7, PTEN, AKT1 and SMAD4, were rare. PD-L1 expression was detected in a significantly higher proportion of MBCs (46%) than in other subtypes (6% each in hormone-positive and HER2-positive breast cancers, and 9% in TNBC, not otherwise specified, p<0.001). PD-1-positive tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) varied greatly in MBCs. Conclusions Comprehensive profiling of a large cohort of this rare subtype of breast carcinoma highlighted the predominance of TP53 mutation and increased PD-L1 expression in carcinoma cells. These results can be exploited in clinical trials using immune checkpoint inhibitors. © 2017 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.","Article","Final","Scopus"

"Introduction of novel 3D-printed superficial applicators for high-dose-rate skin brachytherapy","2017","Brachytherapy","10.1016/j.brachy.2016.11.003","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008240236&doi=10.1016%2fj.brachy.2016.11.003&partnerID=40&md5=1aa9be09536c0bc270baf90d799e1a9f","Purpose Custom-made surface mold applicators often allow more flexibility when carrying out skin brachytherapy, particularly for small treatment areas with high surface obliquity. They can, however, be difficult to manufacture, particularly if there is a lack of experience in superficial high-dose-rate brachytherapy techniques or with limited resources. Methods and Materials We present a novel method of manufacturing superficial brachytherapy applicators utilizing three-dimensional (3D)–printing techniques. We describe the treatment planning process and the process of applicator manufacture. Results The treatment planning process, with the introduction of a pre-plan, allows for an “ideal” catheter arrangement within an applicator to be determined, exploiting varying catheter orientations, heights, and curvatures if required. The pre-plan arrangement is then 3D printed to the exact specifications of the pre-plan applicator design. This results in improved target volume coverage and improved sparing of organs at risk. Conclusions Using a pre-plan technique for ideal catheter placement followed by automated 3D-printed applicator manufacture has greatly improved the entire process of superficial high-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment. We are able to design and manufacture flexible, well-fitting, superior quality applicators resulting in a more efficient and improved patient pathway and patient experience. © 2016 American Brachytherapy Society","Article","Final","Scopus"

Although primarily an aerodynamic device, car rear spoilers experience various vibrations and limited attention has been given to exploiting these vibrations for generating alternative energy. This paper aims to investigate the potential of using the flow-induced vibration of rear spoilers on automobiles for energy harvesting. To that end, a fluid-structure interaction analysis of an inverted NACA 2408 spoiler behind an Ahmed body was undertaken. An Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian flow solver was coupled to a non-linear structural dynamic solver using a commercial software application. The vibrations of the rear spoiler placed at 0, 50 and 100 mm below the top face of the Ahmed body under Reynolds number Re = 2.7 × 106 were simulated. It was found that the vibration of the rear spoiler at the highest elevation showed the largest amplitudes and strain, but the vibration of the rear spoiler at the lowest elevation offers an extended period of vibration before reaching a steady state. With the rear spoiler positioned at the highest elevation, a vibration frequency of 70 Hz and a steady-state principal strain of 350 may be achieved. These vibration levels compared well with previous investigation to sufficiently charge storage capacitors for wireless transmitters. The rear spoiler vibration may offer potential means for energy harvesting, and warrants further experiments under actual driving conditions. © Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Malaysia.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To solve the problem of channel selection and power control to ensure UAV communication quality, a new channel selection and power control method in combination with relevance vector regression (RVR) is proposed. This method builds mapping model among interference information, bit error rate (BER) and signal noise ratio (SNR) based on RVR. Through the model and real-time interference information, the minimum channel SNR meeting the BER requirements of UAV data link can be predicted, and then minimum transmitted power can be calculated. Channel quality is judged based on the minimum channel transmitted power. The method selects channel while determining transmitted power, and makes the process simpler, using the minimum channel power to realize anti-jamming. Simulation experiment shows that this method can select available channel and adjust power effectively, and restrain interference. The proposed method has low time and energy cost, and is practical. © 2017, Editorial Board of JBUAA. All right reserved.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In vitro blood clots and in vivo thrombi can undergo platelet-driven contraction (retraction), resulting in volume shrinkage. Clot contraction can potentially reduce vessel occlusion and improve blood flow past emboli or thrombi. The aim of this work was to examine a potential pathogenic role of clot contraction in ischemic stroke. Approach and Results - We used a novel automated method that enabled us to quantify time of initiation and extent and rate of clot contraction in vitro. The main finding is that clot contraction from the blood of stroke patients was reduced compared with healthy subjects. Reduced clot contraction correlated with a lower platelet count and their dysfunction, higher levels of fibrinogen and hematocrit, leukocytosis, and other changes in blood composition that may affect platelet function and properties of blood clots. Platelets from stroke patents were spontaneously activated and displayed reduced responsiveness to additional stimulation. Clinical correlations with respect to severity and stroke pathogenesis suggest that the impaired clot contraction has the potential to be a pathogenic factor in ischemic stroke. Conclusions - The changeable ability of clots and thrombi to shrink in volume may be a novel unappreciated mechanism that aggravates or alleviates the course and outcomes of ischemic stroke. The clinical importance of clot or thrombus transformations in vivo and the diagnostic and prognostic value of this blood test for clot contraction need further exploration. © 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

We propose an automated framework to solve this problem by identifying which data are consistent and recommending what future experiments or calculations are required. The framework is applied to validate data for the standard enthalpy of formation for 920 gas-phase species containing carbon, oxygen and hydrogen retrieved from the NIST Chemistry WebBook. The concept of error-cancelling balanced reactions is used to calculate a distribution of possible values for the standard enthalpy of formation of each species. The method automates the identification and exclusion of inconsistent data. We find that this enables the rapid convergence of the calculations towards chemical accuracy.

Simulations are performed employing a high-fidelity computational approach capable of accurately capturing the complex unsteady transitional flows. The wing is pitched about its quarter-chord axis to a maximum incidence of 45? over time intervals ranging from four to 16 convective time scales. The Reynolds number based on the wing chord varied from 103 to 4×104. For the highest pitch rate, good agreement between the computed three-dimensional (3D) flow structure and recent experimental measurements is demonstrated. The 3D dynamic stall process is characterized by the formation of an initially spanwise-oriented leading-edge vortex which evolves into an arch-type structure with legs anchored to the wing surface. The normal vorticity in the arch vortex legs establishes a low-pressure region and swirling pattern on the wing surface. A distinct characteristic of the arch vortex is its upstream propagation and persistence over the wing, postulated to be the result of the self-induced velocity of the vortex and its image underneath the plate. Increasing either pitch rate or Reynolds number promotes a more coherent arch vortex and circulation pattern, and delays the onset of stall to a higher angle of attack. Even for the lowest pitch rate considered, a significant increase in maximum lift is achieved relative to the static situation. © 2017 us.

The sensitivity of the applications requires adaptive; efficient; delay bounded and scalable communication network among UAVs for data transmission. Due to communication protocol complexity; rigidity; cost of commercial-off-the-shelf (COT) components; limited radio bandwidth; high mobility and computational resources; maintaining the desired level of Quality of Service (QoS) becomes a daunting task. For the first time in this research we propose multicluster FANETs for efficient network management; the proposed scheme considerably reduces communication cost and optimizes network performance as well as exploit low power; less complex and low cost IEEE 802.15.4 (MAC) protocol for intercluster and intracluster communication. In this research both beacon enabled mode and beaconless modes have been investigated with Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS) and virtual Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) respectively. The methodology plays a key role towards reserving bandwidth for latency critical applications; eliminate collisions and medium access delays.

Removal of submerged marine debris is required to prevent threats to marine and human life, and to maintain a sustainable environment. Detecting and mapping debris is hard due to unique difficulties of the underwater environment. In this paper we propose the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles to detect submerged marine debris from Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS) imagery. We train a Convolutional Neural Network to classify 96 χ 96 images and use this classifier as an object detector in a sliding window fashion. With this detector we can precisely separate debris from background seafloor. In a dataset of household marine debris captured with an ARIS Explorer 3000 FLS, we obtain 80.8% correct debris detections with a binary detector, and 70.8% with a multiclass detector. Our system can also generate detections for untrained objects, which indicates its good generalization capability.

Humans are involved in the risk assessment process which is time consuming, error prone and expensive. The risks identified is also not immediately reflected upon the various people in the software development value chain. This causes the churning rate to find or alleviate risks in the future. In typical SDLC, risks may be developed while coding and it may be evident and would takes different shape as different version of the software gets updated over a period of time. Security aspects of the software solution depends on the code which needs to be consistently tracked on a continuous basis to monitor changes and its related risks, without which vulnerabilities and weakness identification will be reactive.

A set of UWB nodes are located on a moving/still ground station (GS) and interrogate an UWB node placed on the UAV that is flying in front of the GS. The distances between the GS-nodes and the UAV-node are estimated through a conventional two-way time-of-flight ranging method, one at a time, and then used in a multilateration algorithm. Due to the unavoidable relative motion between the UAV and the GS, the above distances are actually measured for different UAV-GS relative positions, and then, the UAV localization performance deteriorates as a function of the UAV-GS relative speed and the ranging-method processing time. An approach is here proposed to mitigate the above adverse effect, by exploiting an estimate of the UAV-GS relative speed along the GS forward direction.

Advancement in autonomy on unmanned vehicles is outpacing test ranges' capability for effective T&E of these systems. DoD test ranges face the challenge of being able to execute a very limited number of live tests to validate increasingly complex systems. APL is performing research and development to help solve the cost and reliability issues associated with on-range T&E of autonomous systems. Using advanced optimization techniques to intelligently explore the highly complex state space in which autonomous systems operate, the Range Adversarial Planning Tool (RAPT) team is developing tools for test ranges to identify the most relevant tests for the full scope of maritime, airborne, and ground-based autonomous systems. The principal challenge with testing and evaluating autonomy is addressing the complex, NP-Hard (non-deterministic polynomial-Time hard) interactions between autonomy and the environment. Decomposing the problem only exacerbates the situation by producing an intractable set of options in various mission conditions and internal states of an autonomous system. Therefore, autonomy can be evaluated only with precise understanding of the interactions between the autonomous vehicle and the environment, enabling delineation of which situations are effective from a T&E perspective and which are not.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Maintenance therapy combined diuretic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and anti-vitamin K. In the month of November 2014 the patient had iterative episodes requiring the delivery of electric shocks by the AID, without the sensation of palpitations suggestive of episodes of arrhythmias. Clinical examination is a poor screening test, especially for heart failure. AID detected multiple episodes of tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation justifying antitachycardia pacing (ATP) therapy or the delivery of electric shocks of 15J. The patient was treated with amiodarone and beta blocker. Evolution was favorable at 3-months follow-up. The patients had resumed normal activities, without experiencing new episodes requiring the delivery of electric shocks. This study emphasizes the essential role of anti-arrhythmic drug therapy for severe ventricular arrhythmias, even in the presence of AID. © Stéphane Méo Ikama et al.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Violation of cybersecurity often results in serious safety issues as been demonstrated in recent studies. However, safety and security in a vehicle platoon so far have been considered separately by different sets of experts. Consequently no existing solution solves both safety and security in a coherent way. In this paper, we show cyber attacks on an automated platoon system could have the most severe level of safety impact with large scale car crash and argue the importance of safety-security co-design for safety critical cyber physical systems (CPS). We propose a safety-security co-design engineering process to derive functional security requirements for a safe automated vehicle platoon system based on a deep comprehension on the interrelation of safety and security. To our best knowledge, we are the first to apply the safety-security co-design concept to a concrete application. Through this engineering process, we propose a general approach for designing a safe and secure platooning. Following the general approach, we come up with a new platoon control algorithm that takes into account both safety and security. Our defense mechanism implicitly defends against safety-related cyber-attacks and greatly shortens the safe distance required when the platoon is not protected. © 2017 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

A legitimate drone may be hijacked by GPS spoofing for illegal activities, such as terrorist attacks. The target of this paper is to develop techniques to let drones detect whether they have been hijacked using onboard motion sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes). Ideally, the linear acceleration and angular velocity measured by motion sensors can be used to estimate the position of a drone, which can be compared with the position reported by GPS to detect whether the drone has been hijacked. However, the position estimation by motion sensors is very inaccurate due to the significant error accumulation over time. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect hijacking based on motion sensors measurements and GPS, which overcomes the accumulative error problem. The computational complexity of our method is very low, and thus is suitable to be implemented in the micro-controllers of drones. Experiments with a quad-rotor drone are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Electrochemically formed carboxyl groups on the surface of the graphite were cross-linked to amino groups in the enzyme so as to attach glucose oxidase to the PL surface. Automated amperometric sensing of glucose solutions in microtiter-plate wells used computer-controlled stepper motors to move the biosensor/counter/reference electrode assemblies sequentially between the samples. This setup achieved stable analyte response and, in calibration trials, a linear response range and detection limit of 0.1-8 mM and 0.05 ± 0.01 mM, respectively. The biosensor microplate assay offered accurate ""hands-off"" evaluation of 4 or 20 samples per plate run, in the standard addition or calibration curve mode, respectively. Mode-independent glucose assays in standard solutions and human serum samples worked reproducibly with close to 100% recovery. The choice of cheap and practical PL enzyme biosensors and simple nonmicrofluidic measurement automation offers a convenient, labor- and cost-efficient form of quantitative biosensing, with a reduced risk of operator errors. The robotic approach is best suited to repetitive measurements of sample series, with academic research and clinical, environmental, pharmaceutical, or biotechnological analysis being potential areas for future exploitations of the methodology. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

They create many islands that are bordered by dense mangrove and comprise three ecological zones: maritime, amphibious and continental. The delta comprises an area of around 500,000 ha and is inhabited by human communities that have been involved in maritime activities for well over two millennia. These include the exploitation of shellfish including the bivalves oyster, Crassostrea gasar, and cockle (Arca senilis) as well as the gastropods “Yett” (Cymbium spp.) and “Touffa” (Murex spp., Thais spp.), and the cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), all of which proliferate in the Delta. Artificial shell mounds comprising bivalves and gastropods provide evidence for a human presence in the Delta for well over 2000 years. In some cases, the shell mounds have also been reused as burial grounds and contain many remains of the ancient fisher-collector inhabitants. The Saloum delta is: (1) an exceptional archaeological landscape with many hundreds of sites, and several periods of excavation, including 1939 (J. de Saint-Seine, M. Yvetot, T. Monod), 1951-1956 (H. Bessac, R. Mauny, G. Thilmans and C. Descamps), in 2000 (H. Bocoum, A. Camara, C. Descamps, E. Dioh, M. Gueye, A.A. Seck, G. Thilmans); (2) an archaeological heritage comprising shell mounds which support many baobab trees (Adonsonia digitata). In some cases, these trees become “sacred forests or woods” where ritual activities take place near modern villages; (3) a rich natural heritage containing shell mounds that have become refuges for wildlife especially birds, and flora… (4) a cultural landscape comprising enduring traditions that are thousands of years old, based on shellfish harvesting and fishing, in a fragile natural environment of great biodiversity. It is one of the few places in the world where traditional shellfishing still survives.

The focus of the work is to document the distribution of the archaeological shell middens, conduct excavations, obtain samples for radiocarbon dating and record the cultural traditions associated with the current collection of shell middens.

This last provides new features of reduced dimensionality, exploited to feed a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier in order to derive the list of objects present in the considered tile.

For proper operation of drones, reliable communication should be guaranteed because drones are remotely controlled. When drones experience communication failure due to bad channel condition, interference, or jamming in a certain area, one existing solution is to exploit mobility or so-called spatial retreat to evacuate them from the communication failure area. However, the conventional spatial retreat scheme moves drones in random directions, which results in inefficient movement with significant evacuation time and waste of battery lifetime. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial retreat technique that takes advantage of cooperation between drones for resilient networking, which is called cooperative spatial retreat (CSR). Our performance evaluation shows that the proposed CSR significantly outperforms existing schemes. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The IVR strategy is to keep the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) intact under SA like core meltdown condition. During the IVR, the core melt (â 1/41327 °C) is collected in the lower head (LH) of the RPV, while the external surface of RPV is submerged in the water. Through external cooling of the RPV, the structural integrity is assumed to be maintained within a prescribed period of time. The maximum thermal loading is referred to critical heat flux (CHF) on the inside, while the external surface is considered to perform in the environment of the boiling crisis point (â 1/4130 °C). Due to the high temperature gradients, the failure mechanisms of the RPV is found to span a wide range of structural behaviors across the wall thickness, such as melt-through, creep damage, plastic yielding as well as thermal expansion. Besides CHF, the pressurized core meltdown was another evident threat to the RPV integrity, as indicated in the Fukushima accident on 2011. In illustrating the effects of internal pressures and individual CHF on the failure behaviors, three typical RPVs with geometric discontinuity caused by local material melting were adopted for the comparative study. Through finite-element method (FEM), the RPV structural behaviors were investigated in terms of deformation, stress, plastic strain, creep, and damage. Finally, some important conclusions are summarized in the concluding remark. Such comparative study provides insight and better understanding for the RPV safety margin under the IVR condition.

The former is useful in assessing the presence of an on-going pregnancy and the latter is essential for labour management. We propose an automated framework for detection of fetal presentation and heartbeat from a predefined free-hand ultrasound sweep of the maternal abdomen. Our method exploits the presence of key anatomical sonographic image patterns in carefully designed scanning protocols to develop, for the first time, an automated framework allowing novice sonographers to detect fetal breech presentation and heartbeat from an ultrasound sweep. The framework consists of a classification regime for a frame by frame categorization of each 2D slice of the video. The classification scores are then regularized through a conditional random field model, taking into account the temporal relationship between the video frames. Subsequently, if consecutive frames of the fetal heart are detected, a kernelized linear dynamical model is used to identify whether a heartbeat can be detected in the sequence. In a dataset of 323 predefined free-hand videos, covering the mother's abdomen in a straight sweep, the fetal skull, abdomen, and heart were detected with a mean classification accuracy of 83.4%. Furthermore, for the detection of the heartbeat an overall classification accuracy of 93.1% was achieved. © 2017 The Authors","Article","Final","Scopus"

One-way and two-way short message service (SMS) medication reminders have differing efficacy in chronic diseases. There is limited literature about SMS medication reminders in SCD. Objective: The goal of this study was to test the feasibility, defined by recruitment/acceptance, retention/ attrition, and technology utilization, of two-way SMS medication reminders in individuals with SCD with and without asthma. Materials and Methods: Participants were randomly allocated to standard care or reminders. Two-way SMS reminders were automated using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) for hydroxyurea, fluticasone, budesonide and montelukast. Adherence was measured using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8). Asthma control was assessed using the Childhood and Adult-Asthma Control Tests (ACT). Participants were enrolled 28 to 60 days with a common termination date. Results: The recruitment rate was 95% (47/49) and 82.9% completed the study. Among the 47 study participants enrolled, 51.1% were male, 61.7% were adults, median age was 20 (range: 3 to 59), and 98% were African Americans. Of the 26 participants receiving messages, 20% responded on over 95% of the days and usage varied with an average response rate of 33%, ranging from 21% to 46%. Medication adherence scores improved significantly in the intervention group (3.42 before, 5.46 after; p=0.002), but not in the control group (3.90 before, 4.75 after; p=0.080). Childhood- ACT scores improved in the intervention group (19.20 before, 24.25 after). Adult-ACT scores within the intervention arm were unchanged (21.0 before, 22.0 after. ACT scores did not improve significantly.

Despite this, the processes leading to the loss of in situ archaeological remains are still poorly understood, including the rates, timing and drivers of surface erosion. This issue is particularly significant for abandoned historical metal mines in upland landscapes, where erosion rates are typically higher due to a combination of the unstable character of the archaeological deposits and the increased effectiveness of surface erosion processes. This study utilises repeat terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to monitor the changing condition of two adjacent lead mines in the North Pennines, UK, over an 18 month period. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the TLS data, in conjunction with land cover characteristics derived from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey, allows the detailed quantification of the causes and impacts of surface change. The results demonstrate that stream bank erosion is the process responsible for the most widespread and archaeologically significant damage, although localised gullying of mine waste heaps resulted in the largest volumetric loss of material (> 160 m3). Temporal variation in the erosion of upland archaeological sites is highly episodic, being dominated (> 70%) by high magnitude but low frequency storm events. These results provide invaluable information regarding the causes and impacts of erosion of upland archaeological remains, as well as establishing a proven methodology which can now be applied to archaeological sites in other landscape contexts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

At the cellular level, this fundamental principle is expressed in the form of molecular mechanisms for preconditioning and tolerance. When the cell is threatened, internal cascades of survival signaling become triggered to protect against cell death and defend against future insults. Recently, however, emerging findings suggest that this principle of self-preservation may involve not only intracellular signals; the release of extracellular signals may provide a way to recruit adjacent cells into an amplified protective program. In the central nervous system where multiple cell types co-exist, this mechanism would allow threatened neurons to “ask for help” from glial and vascular compartments. In this review, we describe this new concept of help-me signaling, wherein damaged or diseased neurons release signals that may shift glial and vascular cells into potentially beneficial phenotypes, and help remodel the neurovascular unit. Understanding and dissecting these non-cell autonomous mechanisms of self-preservation in the CNS may lead to novel opportunities for neuroprotection and neurorecovery. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Review","Final","Scopus"

First, measurements of atmospheric CO mole fraction were continuously collected in a Paris (France) suburb over 1 week. Both instruments showed an excellent agreement within typically 2 ppb (part per billion in volume), fulfilling the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommendation for CO inter-laboratory comparison. The compact size and robustness of the OF-CEAS instrument allowed its operation aboard a small aircraft employed for routine tropospheric air analysis over the French Orléans forest area. Direct OF-CEAS real-time CO measurements in tropospheric air were then compared with later analysis of flask samples by the gas chromatograph. Again, a very good agreement was observed. This work establishes that the OF-CEAS laser spectrometer can run unattended at a very high level of sensitivity ( &lt; 1 ppb) and stability without any periodic calibration. © 2017 Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"
"Statistical approaches for the definition of landslide rainfall thresholds and their uncertainty using rain gauge and satellite data","2017","Geomorphology","10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.02.001","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012978006&doi=10.1016%2fj.geomorph.2017.02.001&partnerID=40&md5=46241fe460fd2abc081674b51c12848e","Models for forecasting rainfall-induced landslides are mostly based on the identification of empirical rainfall thresholds obtained exploiting rain gauge data. Despite their increased availability, satellite rainfall estimates are scarcely used for this purpose. Satellite data should be useful in ungauged and remote areas, or should provide a significant spatial and temporal reference in gauged areas. In this paper, the analysis of the reliability of rainfall thresholds based on rainfall remote sensed and rain gauge data for the prediction of landslide occurrence is carried out. To date, the estimation of the uncertainty associated with the empirical rainfall thresholds is mostly based on a bootstrap resampling of the rainfall duration and the cumulated event rainfall pairs (D,E) characterizing rainfall events responsible for past failures. This estimation does not consider the measurement uncertainty associated with D and E. In the paper, we propose (i) a new automated procedure to reconstruct ED conditions responsible for the landslide triggering and their uncertainties, and (ii) three new methods to identify rainfall threshold for the possible landslide occurrence, exploiting rain gauge and satellite data. In particular, the proposed methods are based on Least Square (LS), Quantile Regression (QR) and Nonlinear Least Square (NLS) statistical approaches. We applied the new procedure and methods to define empirical rainfall thresholds and their associated uncertainties in the Umbria region (central Italy) using both rain-gauge measurements and satellite estimates. We finally validated the thresholds and tested the effectiveness of the different threshold definition methods with independent landslide information. The NLS method among the others performed better in calculating thresholds in the full range of rainfall durations. We found that the thresholds obtained from satellite data are lower than those obtained from rain gauge measurements. This is in agreement with the literature, where satellite rainfall data underestimate the “ground” rainfall registered by rain gauges. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Some organizations opt to disable their printer's wireless connectivity, others are not aware at all that it is enabled and some enable it in an encrypted form. In this paper we demonstrate how an application called ""pFaker"" running on a mobile device or smart watch can be used to mimic a printer's Wi-Fi connectivity and functionalities in order to harm user privacy by unobtrusively stealing print jobs. To mitigate these risks, we developed a mobile application called ""Cyber-Security Patrol"". We demonstrate how a mobile phone running Cyber-Security patrol can be placed on a drone or an autonomous vacuum cleaner to search for devices that try to mimic the printer's Wi-Fi connectivity and for printers that expose unsecured wireless connection in the target organization. Cyber-Security Patrol takes photos of the location where unauthorized Wi-Fi enabled printers were detected and sends them to the organization's administrator. For cases that the Wi-Fi enabled printer is legitimate but unsecured, Cyber Security Patrol sends a print job to the printer with detailed instructions on how to secure the specific printer model as identified based on its Service Set Identifier (SSID).

Long-term use of GCs, however, can result in metabolic side effects such as hyperglycemia, hepatosteatosis, and insulin resistance. The GC receptor (GR) and liver X receptors (LXRα and LXRβ) regulate overlapping genes involved in gluconeogenesis and inflammation. We have previously shown that Lxrβ-/- mice are resistant to the diabetogenic effects of DEX but still sensitive to its immunosuppressive actions. To determine whether this finding could be exploited for therapeutic intervention, we treated mice with GSK2033, a pan-LXR antagonist, alone or combined with DEX. GSK2033 suppressed GC-induced gluconeogenic gene expression without affecting immuneresponsive GR target genes. The suppressive effect of GSK2033 on DEX-induced gluconeogenic genes was specific to LXRβ, was liver cell autonomous, and occurred in a target gene-specific manner. Compared with DEX treatment alone, the coadministration of GSK2033 with DEX decreased the recruitment of GR and its accessory factors MED1 and C/EBPβ to the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter. However, GSK2033 had no effect on DEX-mediated suppression of inflammatory genes expressed in the liver or in mouse primary macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharides. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that the gluconeogenic and immunosuppressive actions of GR activation can be mechanistically dissociated by pharmacological antagonism of LXRb. Treatment with an LXRb antagonist could allow the safer use of existing GC drugs in patients requiring chronic dosing of anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. © 2017 Endocrine Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Moreover, once the interaction with the early classical Greek philosophical quest for causes and general explanations had caused mathematical explanation to become an autonomous endeavour in the shape of explicit proof and deductivity, proof and deductivity presented themselves as options - sometimes exploited, sometimes not - even in the teaching of mathematics for practitioners. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

They are highly nonlinear systems that involve a large number of subroutine calls and submodel switches during execution. To calibrate a building energy simulation model with good quality, parameter sensitivity analysis is well advocated, since it aims to identify those parameters in a specific building that hold more influence on the building thermal performance than others to facilitate shortening the lengthy cycle of model calibration procedures. Since simulation models are given in a large piece of source codes and encapsulate a series of submodels, the prevailing sensitivity analysis is mostly built within the framework of Monte Carlo simulation and statistics-based random sampling methods. It is computationally intensive. We propose to perform such analysis via a differential sensitivity analysis method that relies on the estimation of derivatives. A key technical challenge is that the high nonlinearity of the model prohibits any analytical differentiation, while numerical differentiation is too sensitive to step size and suffers from a truncation error. We, hence, propose to adopt an algorithmic differentiation method, which exploits the operator overload feature of object-oriented programs, to obtain accurate and robust numerical estimations of derivatives in an automated and computationally efficient way. © 2016 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Since the autonomous vehicles have the characteristics of nonlinearities, external disturbances and strong coupling, a novel adaptive fuzzy sliding coordinated control system is constructed to supervise the longitudinal and lateral motions of autonomous vehicles, in which the fuzzy system is employed to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. Due to the low sensitivity to disturbances and plant parameter variations, the proposed control approach is an efficient way to handle with the complex dynamic plants operating under un-certainty conditions. The asymptotic stability of adaptive coordinated platoon close-loop control system is verified based on the Lyapunov stability theory. The results indicate that the presented adaptive coordinated platoon control approach can accurately achieve the tracking performance and ensures the stability and riding comfort of autonomous vehicles in a platoon.

The potential exposure risks were then evaluated. Overall, pesticide contamination is the most serious risk in the first three months of the calendar year (Jan–Mar); thereafter the levels of contamination tend to decrease. There were 6325 samples (31.97%) that contained pesticide residues, and 768 samples (3.88%) that exceeded the maximum residue limits (MRLs). The highest residue rates and those exceeding MRLs rate were found in celery. Leafy vegetables and legume vegetables were more contaminated than other vegetable groups. The most frequently detected pesticide was procymidone (6.43%). Some banned or restricted pesticides such as HCB, DDT and carbofuran were detected. The highest detected concentration was in cypermethrin (7.40 mg/kg). The target hazard quotient (THQ) of all pesticides was <1, and the hazard index (HI) was 0.0872. The results supported that pesticide residues in vegetables may not pose a serious threat to public health in Xinjiang, despite a high detection rate.

While UAV-aided networks can potentially find applications in many areas, a number of issues, particularly security, have not been readily addressed. The intrusion detection system is the most commonly used technique to detect attackers. In this paper, we focus on addressing two main issues within the context of intrusion detection and attacker ejection in UAV-aided networks, namely, activation of the intrusion monitoring process and attacker ejection. In fact, when a large number of nodes activate their monitoring processes, the incurred overhead can be substantial and, as a consequence, degrades the network performance. Therefore, a tradeoff between the intrusion detection rate and overhead is considered in this work. It is not always the best strategy to eject a node immediately when it exhibits a bad sign of malicious activities since this sign could be provisional (the node may switch to a normal behavior in the future) or be simply due to noise or unreliable communications. Thus, a dilemma between detection and false positive rates is taken into account in this paper. We propose to address these two security issues by a Bayesian game model in order to accurately detect attacks (i.e., high detection and low false positive rates) with a low overhead. Simulation results have demonstrated that our proposed security game framework does achieve reliable detection. © 2017 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

We construct the static threat (ST) model based on an intuitionistic fuzzy set (A-IFS) to deal with the uncertainty of a environmental threat. The problem of avoiding a dynamic threat (DT) is formulated as a pursuit-evasion game. A reachability set (RS) estimator of an uncertain DT is constructed by combining the motion prediction with a RRT-based method. An online path planning framework is proposed by integrating a sub goal selector, a sub tasks allocator and a local path planner. The selector and allocator are presented to accelerate the path searching process. Dynamic domain rapidly-exploring random tree (DDRRT) is combined with the linear quadratic Gaussian motion planning (LQG-MP) method when searching local paths under threats and uncertainties. The path that has been searched is further improved by using a safety adjustment method and the RRT* method in the planning system.

The functional safety of systems, products and processes increases with every day and with every new development and we must maintain a grasp of the risks during every phase: from the first concept through development and from operation through shutdown. With the increasing complexity of automotive devices mainly microcontrollers with increased performance, features and memory size the importance of soft errors is becoming critical and must be considered as potential main risk for safety critical functions. Increased connectivity and complexity creates serious security challenges for the design of automotive hardware/software architectures due to attacks. Virtualization is now being made available in automotive embedded environments providing developers with the ultimate open platform: The ability to run any flavor of operating system in any combination, creating an unprecedented flexibility for deployment and usage. With the immense processing power that is being unlocked with multi-processor systems we are now able to address complex issues such as a complete inspection of the vehicle's environment. In this paper we will discuss the challenges of implementing a safe, secure, complex driver assistance system that paves the way towards autonomous driving. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Metered air bubbles controlled by microvalves are used to improve bead-solution mixing thereby enhancing the hybridization of the target Ebola virus RNA with capture probes bound to the beads. The method uses thermally stable 4-formyl benzamide functionalized (4FB) magnetic beads rather than streptavidin coated beads with a high density of capture probes to improve the target capture efficiency. Exploiting an on-chip concentration protocol in the SPM and the single molecule detection capability of the antiresonant reflecting optical waveguide (ARROW) biosensor chip, a detection limit of 0.021 pfu/mL for clinical samples is achieved without target amplification. This RNA target capture efficiency is two orders of magnitude higher than previous results using streptavidin beads and the limit of detection (LOD) improves 10×. The wide dynamic range of this technique covers the whole clinically applicable concentration range. In addition, the current sample preparation time is ~1 h which is eight times faster than previous work. This multiplexed, miniaturized sample preparation microdevice establishes a key technology that intended to develop next generation point-of-care (POC) detection system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Due to the openness in nature, RFID tags suffer with potential security threats. One of the major threats is privacy leakage during the authentication process. The RFID tag can be read from a distance of 10cm-30 meters, therefore it is possible that it can be read by any unauthorized reader and can be cloned or the information can be used otherwise. In this paper we proposed an authentication protocol based on salted hash function for preserving the privacy of the tag.

Surface gliders are small, reusable autonomous underwater vehicles designed to glide through the water surface while measuring pH, oil spill and other parameters. Here it deals with an accuracy-aware diffusion process using surface gliders. In practical application, the global positions of the robots can be accurately measured but it may be unstable in some area were there were no GPS coverage's to avoid this problem we introduce a new method to track the surface gliders which The gliders are used to measure the water quality that is unable to protect itself from damage.

We examine two potential threats, false data dissemination and vehicle tracking, in an NDN-based autonomous vehicular network. To detect false data, we propose a four-level hierarchical trust model and the associated naming scheme for vehicular data authentication. Moreover, we address vehicle tracking concerns using a pseudonym scheme to anonymize vehicle names and certificate issuing proxies to further protect vehicle identity.

These data-driven techniques extract models from training data, where their performance is often analyzed with respect to random errors in the training data. However, if the training data is maliciously altered by attackers, the effect of these attacks on the learning algorithms underpinning data-driven CPS have yet to be considered. In this paper, we analyze the resilience of classification algorithms to training data attacks. Specifically, a generic metric is proposed that is tailored to measure resilience of classification algorithms with respect to worst-case tampering of the training data. Using the metric, we show that traditional linear classification algorithms are resilient under restricted conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a linear classification algorithm with a majority constraint and prove that it is strictly more resilient than the traditional algorithms. Evaluations on both synthetic data and a real-world retrospective arrhythmia medical case-study show that the traditional algorithms are vulnerable to tampered training data, whereas the proposed algorithm is more resilient (as measured by worst-case tampering). © 2017 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In the McAfee Labs 2017 Threats Prediction report published at the end of 2016, Intel cyber-security and privacy director Bruce Snell predicted drone hijacking will become a practical reality in the coming months. Snell sees a key risk emerging for delivery companies if drone-transported stock is stolen. Criminals may simply steal expensive camera equipment from drones used to capture video and take high-quality photos of the Earth underneath. Security researcher Jonathan Andersson has already shown that dronejacking kits are feasible. He created a pocket-sized device he calls Icarus after the mythical ancient Greek figure who lost his wings by flying too close to the sun. Samy Kamkar has made a device using a Raspberry Pi mini-computer powered by a USB battery pack, and has attached it to a drone of his own. The Skyjack drone, as Kamkar has dubbed it, is capable of patrolling the skies sniffing out other drones and then hacking into them to take control. Kamkar's drone can connect to multiple other UAVs simultaneously, and he can pilot them or he can just view the camera live by connecting through his own phone or tablet. Intel Security CTO Raj Samani suggest some things that could be done: having an approved and agreed communications standard, encrypting the signal and using stronger authentication. The drone software should verify the source of the commands it is receiving and reject those coming from unapproved transmitters. Drone software could also build in measures to automatically detect common attacks such as replay attacks.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Thus, it is imperative that the design of any security-aware CPS considers the impact of the human interaction with the system on security guarantees. Yet, there has been very little work on design of Human-CPS that promotes human situational awareness for enhanced system performance, particularly in terms of cyber-physical security and real-time defense against attacks. One of the main obstacles to the rapid advancement of this field is the scarcity of testbeds for evaluating security-aware Human-CPS interactions. We present RESCHU-SA, an extendable virtual platform that facilitates studying the impact that HOL has on security of CPS with varying levels of autonomy. It allows users to analyze how inductive reasoning and ability to provide context, particularly during an attack, affects the overall CPS security guarantees.

A reliable electrical grid is something most of us take for granted, but storms, heavy snowfall, and other effects of extreme weather continue to cause disruptions in electricity supply. This paper contributes to ensuring the continuity of electricity supply under adverse weather events. The aim is to describe and to analyze how the continuity of electricity supply can be ensured in the case of extreme weather. Based on the research, the energy sector is highly dependent on the existing locations and structures of the current infrastructure. Aging infrastructure is commonly seen as a main vulnerability factor. The most vulnerable parts of the electricity distribution system to extreme weather conditions are the networks built as overhead lines. However, the resilience of the networks against extreme weather can be increased significantly in all phases of a disaster management cycle. Methods and technological solutions proposed in this paper to alleviate such problems include adjacent forest management and periodic aerial inspections, situational awareness, distributed generation and microgrids, placement of overhead lines, underground cabling, and unmanned air vehicles. However, it must be noticed that the methods and their value for stakeholders are context-dependent. Thus, their applicability and appropriateness may change over time.

This novel information may help optimize treatment in individual patients, monitor inter-ventional efficacy, and develop new treatments. Moreover, by automating the measurement of regional biomarkers for the 19 different anatomical lung segments, there is an opportunity to embed imaging biomarkers into clinically acceptable clinical workflows and improve lung disease clinical care. Therefore, to exploit the regional structure–function information provided by thoracic imaging, and as a first step toward this goal, our objective was to develop a fully automated registration pipeline for thoracic x-ray computed tomography (CT) and inhaled gas functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) whole lung and segmental structure–function biomarkers. Methods: Thirty-five patients including 15 severe, poorly controlled asthmatics and 20 COPD patients [classified according to the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) criteria)] provided written informed consent to a study protocol approved by Health Canada and underwent pulmonary function tests, MRI, and CT during a single 2-hour visit. Using this diverse patient dataset, we developed and evaluated a joint deformable registration approach to simultaneously coregister CT with both1H and3He MRI by enforcing the similarity of the deformation fields from the two individual registrations. We derived a simpler model that was equivalent to the original challenging optimization problem through variational analysis and the simpler model gave rise to an efficient numerical solver that was parallelized on a graphics processing unit. The coregistered CT-3He MRI and whole lung/segmental lung masks were used to generate whole lung and segmental3He MRI ventilation defect percent (VDP). To estimate fiducial localization reproducibility, a single observer manually identified 109 pairs of CT and3He MRI fidu-cials for 35 patient images on five separate occasions and determined the fiducial localization error (FLE). CT-3He MRI registration accuracy was evaluated using the target registration error (TRE). Whole lung VDP generated using the algorithm was compared with VDP generated using a previously validated semiautomated approach and computational efficiency was evaluated using run time. Results: In 35 patients including 15 with severe asthma and 20 with COPD, mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was 63±24%pred and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) was 54 ± 17%. FLE was 0.16 mm and 0.34 mm for3He MRI and CT, respectively. TRE was 4.5 ± 2.0 mm, 4.0 ± 1.7 mm, 4.8 ± 2.3 mm for asthma, COPD GOLD II, and GOLD III groups, respectively, with a mean of 4.4 ± 2.0 mm for the entire dataset. TRE was significantly improved for joint CT-1H/3He MRI registration compared with CT-1H MRI rigid registration (P < 0.0001). Whole lung VDP generated using the pipeline was not significantly different (P = 0.37) compared to a semiauto-mated method with which it was strongly correlated (r = 0.93, P < 0.0001). The fully automated pipeline required 11 ± 0.4 min to generate whole lung and segmental VDP. Conclusions: For a diverse group of patients with COPD and asthma, whole lung and segmental VDP was measured using an automated lung image analysis pipeline which provides a way to incor-porate lung functional biomarkers into clinical research and patient care. © 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Based on the extracted Region Of Interest (ROI) and statistical information about projections, the confirmation phase characterizes the contours and obstacles positions. Computationally intensive stereovision techniques are optimized for use in real-time applications. The scheme has been tested on a custom-developed wheeled mobile robot. The experimental findings show the benefits of our scheme. The robot detects obstacles of any size and shape within a range of 80-200cm. The results demonstrate that the robot has the ability to precisely navigate in a wide range of illumination conditions.

A way to deal with multi-mode estimation for a small fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization framework is proposed, which depends on utilizing a Luenberger observer-based linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. The proposed estimation technique relies on the interaction between multiple measurement modes and a continuous observer. The state estimation is performed in a switching environment between multiple active sensors to exploit the available information as much as possible, especially in GPS-denied environments. Luenberger observer-based projection is implemented as a continuous observer to optimize the estimation performance. The observer gain might be chosen by solving a Lyapunov equation by means of a LMI algorithm. Convergence is achieved by utilizing the linear matrix inequality (LMI), based on Lyapunov stability which keeps the dynamic estimation error bounded by selecting the observer gain matrix (L). Simulation results are presented for a small UAV fixed wing localization problem. The results obtained using the proposed approach are compared with a single mode Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the viability of the proposed strategy. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Several P-8s ASW patrol aircraft fly over the mine field and, in a predetermined pattern, launch a swarm of micro-UUVs from their sonobuoy tubes to find a clear channel for the carrier task group to safely break out into the open sea. Each UUV of the swarm sweeps a sector of the mine field with high-resolution sonar and executes onboard CAD/CAC processing for the detection and positioning of mine-like objects on the bottom and in the water column. Upon completing its assigned sector, each UUV surfaces and transmits mine-like object position data to MCM central control, where the data are analyzed and a safe passage course transmitted to the carrier task group for breakout. As the availability of small UUVs, increasing energy density, miniature payloads, better sensors, faster processors and improved communications becomes widespread, the potential for pervasive undersea mission capabilities based on the coordinated operation of multiple, small UUVs becomes both feasible and desirable.

Single unmanned ship has been far from meeting the complex needs of the development of the ocean. But multiple unmanned ships cooperation system could expand the perception scope of individual unmanned ship, and achieve complex tasks. By adopting leader–follower architecture, the formation control scheme is composed of three vehicles. The objective is to synchronize the motion of the flock and show high performances of cooperative control. The controller uses fuzzy control, however, Fuzzy control not only depends on the fuzzy rules of experts, while scaling factors are important parameters that affect the performance of fuzzy control, and scaling factors are usually obtained by trial and error, so it is necessary to find a quick and effective way to adjust the quantization parameters. This paper uses the intelligent algorithm to optimize the entire controller. The simulation results show that follower unmanned ships move to the leader’s path quickly.

The compounds included in the study were 426 pesticides, 117 veterinary drugs, 42 food-packaging contaminants, 21 mycotoxins, 10 perfluorinated compounds, 9 nitrosamines, and 5 sweeteners. The separation was carried out by liquid chromatography using a C18 column (50 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm particle size). The identification of the targeted species was accomplished using accurate masses of the targeted ions (protonated or deprotonated molecule) along with retention time data and characteristic fragment ion for reliable identification, using specific software for automated data mining and exploitation. The performance of the screening method was validated in terms of linearity, matrix effect, and limits of quantification for three representative food matrices (tomato, orange, and baby food) using a generic sample treatment based on liquid partitioning with acetonitrile (QuEChERS). The overall method performance was satisfactory with limits of quantification lower than 10 μg kg −1 for the 44 % of studied compounds. In some cases (ca. 10–15 % of the pesticides depending on the matrix tested, maximum residue levels were not fulfilled). In orange, 15 % of the compounds displayed LOQs above the maximum residue levels (MRLs) set for the studied pesticides, which can be partially attributed to matrix effects. Moderate signal suppression was observed in the three matrices tested in most cases, being orange the matrix which produced the highest matrix effect and baby food the lowest one. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Game theory enables us to ask the question of optimality in an adversarial environment; what is the optimal strategy that an atacker can use to disrupt the operation of automated vehicles, considering that the defenders are also optimally trying to maintain normal operation. We formulate a zero-sum game and find optimal controllers for different game parameters. A platoon is then simulated and its closed loop stability is then evaluated in the presence of an optimal atack. It is shown that with the constraint of optimality, the attacker cannot significantly degrade the stability of a vehicle platoon in nominal cases. It is motivated that in order to have an optimal solution that is nearly unstable, the game has to be formulated almost unfairly in favor of the atacker. © 2017 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To overcome these limitations, it is required that the SAA system perform equally or even better than the human eye. This can be achieved integrating information from different sensors using data fusion algorithms, like Bayesian estimators or neural network techniques. SAA system degradation could arise from both single sensor shortcomings and bad numerical behaviours, injected by the specific fusion algorithm, such as real machine round-off errors or divergences introduced by approximating strongly nonlinear functions. An alternative formulation of the Square-Root unscented Kalman filter (SRUKF) based on the Joseph form of the state covariance update step, is used in order to avoid numerical instabilities induced by ill-conditioned matrix problems. The novelty of this technique lies in the exploitation of the Sigma-Point Kalman filters, which ensure a higher-order accuracy in the nonlinear inference problem solving, and in the application of the Joseph update equation, which improves numerical robustness. Moreover, this approach prevents the algorithm from failing, avoiding the downdating process of the Cholesky factor when the SRUKF is used and to take advantage by the higher numerical stability assured by a lower matrix condition number. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, implementation is held back by uncertainties, including public acceptance, liability, and privacy. So, their potential to reduce urban transport problems may not be fully realized. We propose an adaptive approach to implementation that takes some actions right away and creates a framework for future actions that allows for adaptations over time as knowledge about performance and acceptance of the new system (called ‘automated taxis’) accumulates and critical events for implementation take place.

Among these, they can play an important role in monitoring critical events (e.g., disaster monitoring) when the presence of humans close to the scene shall be avoided for safety reasons, in precision farming and surveying. Despite the very large number of possible applications, their usage is mainly limited by the availability of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in the considered environment: indeed, GNSS is of fundamental importance in order to reduce positioning error derived by the drift of (low-cost) Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) internal sensors. In order to make the usage of UAVs possible even in critical environments (when GNSS is not available or not reliable, e.g., close to mountains or in city centers, close to high buildings), this paper considers the use of a low cost UltraWide-Band (UWB) system as the positioning method. Furthermore, assuming the use of a calibrated camera, UWB positioning is exploited to achieve metric reconstruction on a local coordinate system. Once the georeferenced position of at least three points (e.g., positions of three UWB devices) is known, then georeferencing can be obtained, as well. The proposed approach is validated on a specific case study, the reconstruction of the façade of a university building. Average error on 90 check points distributed over the building façade, obtained by georeferencing by means of the georeferenced positions of four UWB devices at fixed positions, is 0.29 m. For comparison, the average error obtained by using four ground control points is 0.18 m. © 2017 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, the allocation of such virtual resources is still performed by human administrators, which limits the agility of such systems to respond to events and new requirements. In this paper we propose an architecture that exploits the capabilities offered by virtualization techniques to achieve the prompt adaptation of network and computing resources to the needs imposed by their changing environments by automating control and management operations in an autonomic manner. It collects observations from any of element of the environment, including resources and sensors, and characterizes them as semantic observations. Such observations are then analyzed to determine if any corrective or perfective change is required to overcome a possible problem. The whole process is automated but guided by control statements provided by administrators, so the actions it can take have totally predictive results. As it provides a closed control loop, the expected effects of such actions are continuously checked.

The interconnectivity of things is the key enabler in these initiatives. An important building block is smart mobility, and it revolves around resolving land transport challenges in cities with dense populations. A transformative direction that global stakeholders are looking into is autonomous vehicles and the transport infrastructure to interconnect them to the traffic management system (that is, vehicle to infrastructure connectivity), as well as to communicate with one another (that is, vehicle to vehicle connectivity) to facilitate better awareness of road conditions. A number of countries had also started to take autonomous vehicles to the roads to conduct trials and are moving towards the plan for larger scale deployment. However, an important consideration in this space is the security of the autonomous vehicles. There has been an increasing interest in the attacks and defences of autonomous vehicles as these vehicles are getting ready to go onto the roads. In this paper, we aim to organize and discuss the various methods of attacking and defending autonomous vehicles, and propose a comprehensive attack and defence taxonomy to better categorize each of them. Through this work, we hope that it provides a better understanding of how targeted defences should be put in place for targeted attacks, and for technologists to be more mindful of the pitfalls when developing architectures, algorithms and protocols, so as to realise a more secure infrastructure composed of dependable autonomous vehicles. © 2016 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) copies inserted within introns can be exploited as potential intron length polymorphism(ILP) markers. ILPs can be detectedby PCRwith primers anchoredin exon sequences flanking the target introns. Here, we designed primers for 209 DcSto (Daucus carota Stowaway-like) MITE insertion sites within introns along the carrot genome and validated them as candidate ILP markers in order to develop a set of markers for genotyping the carrot. As a proof of concept, 90 biallelic DcS-ILP markers were selected andusedto assess genetic diversity of 27 accessions comprising wildDaucus carota and cultivated carrot of different root shape. The number of effective alleles was 1.56, mean polymorphism informative content was 0.27, while the average observed and expected heterozygosity was 0.24 and 0.34, respectively. Sixty-seven loci showed positive values of Wright’s fixation index. Using Bayesian approach, two clusters comprising four wild and 23 cultivated accessions, respectively, were distinguished. Within the cultivated carrot gene pool, four subclusters representing accessions from Chantenay, Danvers, Imperator, and Paris Market types were revealed. It is the first molecular evidence for root-type associated diversity structure in western cultivated carrot.

It can be considered one of the most extreme examples on the Mediterranean coast of severe pathologies associated with urban development on coastal landslides. The resort, with 416 dwellings, was partially built on a deep-seated landslide which affects a soft formation composed of dark graphite schists. In November 2015, the City Council officially declared a state of emergency in the resort and 24 dwellings have already been evacuated. We have used two remote sensing techniques to monitor the landslide with the aim of identifying and measuring a wide range of displacements rates (from mm/year to m/year): (1) PSInSAR, exploiting 25 ENVISAT SAR images acquired from May 2003 to December 2009, and (2) photogrammetry, considering the output from two Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights made in June 2015 and January 2016 and the outdated photos from a conventional flight in 2008. The relationship between the geology of the site, data from PS deformation measurements, building displacements, rainfall and damage observed and their temporal occurrence allows a better understanding of the landslide kinematics and both the spatial and temporal evolution of the instability. Results indicate building displacements of up to 1.92 m in 8 years, a clear lithological control in the spatial distribution of damage and a close relationship between the most damaging events and water recharge episodes (rainy events and leaks from swimming pools and the water supply network).

The iterative algorithm was presented. The influence of the difference between gravity and buoyancy, jet pump thrust, initial pitching angle and the position of the wings on the HUST-2 glider's velocity and horizontal velocity were studied by using the algorithm. The scope of the gliding angle was analyzed when the glider travelling steadily in vertical plane. The simulation results show that the glider's velocity and absolute value of pitching angle increases and attack angle decreases with the difference between gravity and buoyancy increasing. It also indicates that the pump thrust can improve the glider's velocities effectively. The glider's velocity is largely affected by initial pitching angle of the glider and the position of the wings. It indicates that there is a best initial pitching angle that make glider's steady horizontal velocity be reached the maximum for every difference between gravity and buoyancy of the glider. So an appropriate initial pitching angle should be chosen to obtain the maximum horizontal velocity. The larger velocity of the glider can be obtained by mounting the wings later. To decrease the gliding angle, the ratio of the lift to drag of the glider should be increased. © 2017, Editorial Board of Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Energy-efficient routing of such vehicles is of great interest for both financial and environmental sustainability. Given a multi-capacity RGV working on a linear track in AFHS, we consider its optimal routing under two-sided loading/unloading (TSLU) operations, in which energy consumption is minimized under conflict-avoidance and time window constraints. The energy consumption takes account of dynamics and routing-dependent gross weight of the RGV. And the conflict-avoidance constraints ensure conflict-free transport service under TSLU operations. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, and solved by incorporating valid inequalities that exploit structural properties of the problem. The static problem model and solution approach are then integrated with a rolling-horizon approach to solve the dynamic routing problem where air cargo enters and departs from the system dynamically in time. Simulation results suggest that the proposed strategy is able to route a RGV to transport air cargo with an energy cost that is considerably lower than one of the most common heuristic methods implemented in current practice. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

These methods heavily rely on matrix computations, and it is hence critical to make these computations scalable and efficient. These matrix computations are often complex and involve multiple steps that need to be optimized and sequenced properly for efficient execution. This paper presents new efficient and scalable matrix processing and optimization techniques for in-memory distributed clusters. The proposed techniques estimate the sparsity of intermediate matrix-computation results and optimize communication costs. An evaluation plan generator for complex matrix computations is introduced as well as a distributed plan optimizer that exploits dynamic cost-based analysis and rule-based heuristics to optimize the cost of matrix computations in an in-memory distributed environment. The result of a matrix operation will often serve as an input to another matrix operation, thus defining the matrix data dependencies within a matrix program. The matrix query plan generator produces query execution plans that minimize memory usage and communication overhead by partitioning the matrix based on the data dependencies in the execution plan. We implemented the proposed matrix processing and optimization techniques in Spark, a distributed in-memory computing platform. Experiments on both real and synthetic data demonstrate that our proposed techniques achieve up to an order-of-magnitude performance improvement over state-ofthe-Art distributed matrix computation systems on a wide range of applications. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Its unique spatial resolution enables direct imaging of crystal defects as small as single vacancies. To fully exploit FIM's potential, automated analysis tools are required. The reconstruction algorithm developed here relies on minimal assumptions and is sensitive to atomic coordinates of all imaged atoms. It tracks the atoms across a sequence of images, allocating each to its respective crystallographic plane. The result is a highly accurate 3D lattice-resolved reconstruction. The procedure is applied to over 2000 tungsten atoms, including ion-implanted planes. The approach is further adapted to analyze carbides in a steel matrix, demonstrating its applicability to a range of materials. A vast amount of information is collected during the experiment that can underpin advanced analyses such as automated detection of out of sequence events, subangstrom surface displacements and defects effects on neighboring atoms. These analyses have the potential to reveal new insights into the field evaporation process and contribute to improving accuracy and scope of 3D FIM and atom probe characterization. © Microscopy Society of America 2017.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

It is observed that providing privacy to the patient’s data is an important issue and can be challenging. The information passing is done via the public channel in WMSN. Thus, the patient, sensitive information can be obtained by eavesdropping or by unauthorized use of handheld devices which the health professionals use in monitoring the patient. Therefore, there is an essential need of restricting the unauthorized access to the patient’s medical information. Hence, the efficient authentication scheme for the healthcare applications is needed to preserve the privacy of the patients’ vital signs. To ensure secure and authorized communication in WMSN, we design a symmetric key based authentication protocol for WMSN environment. The proposed protocol uses only computationally efficient operations to achieve lightweight attribute. We analyze the security of the proposed protocol. We use a formal security proof algorithm to show the scheme security against known attacks. We also use the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) simulator to show protocol secure against man-in-the-middle attack and replay attack. Additionally, we adopt an informal analysis to discuss the key attributes of the proposed scheme. From the formal proof of security, we can see that an attacker has a negligible probability of breaking the protocol security. AVISPA simulator also demonstrates the proposed scheme security against active attacks, namely, man-in-the-middle attack and replay attack. Additionally, through the comparison of computational efficiency and security attributes with several recent results, proposed scheme seems to be battered. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It is assumed that the desired location of the followers are known in the velocity frame of the leader. It is also assumed that the followers can also access the position, velocity and acceleration parameters of the leader as necessary auxiliary information. By utilizing this information and manipulating their own dynamics, the proposed logic autonomously guides the followers to their respective desired positions. Depending on the leader's velocity and acceleration information as well as the intended relative location, the formulation also ensures an appropriate direction of the velocity vectors of the followers at the desired relative locations, including its rate of change if any. This leads to minimal transient effects while maintaining the formation even under maneuvering conditions. Usage of quaternions and other innovations ensure that the formulation is singularity-free and hence formation flying is ensured even under aggressive maneuvers of the leader without any restriction on its velocity vector direction. The desired thrust, angle of attack and bank angle are generated using a nonlinear point mass model of a vehicle. The generated guidance commands are then realized using a nonlinear six-DOF model, making the formulation practically more relevant. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of bringing the UAVs from arbitrary initial locations to the desired formation and then maintaining the formation even under highly agile motion of the leader. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Several autophagy receptors can recognize invading pathogens in order to target them towards autophagy for their degradation after the fusion of pathogen-containing autophagosomes with lysosomes. However, numerous intracellular pathogens can avoid or exploit autophagy, among which is measles virus (MeV). This virus induces a complete autophagy flux, which is required to improve viral replication. We therefore asked how measles virus interferes with autophagy receptors during the course of infection. We report that in addition to NDP52/CALCOCO2 and OPTINEURIN/OPTN, another autophagy receptor, namely T6BP/TAXIBP1, also regulates the maturation of autophagosomes by promoting their fusion with lysosomes, independently of any infection. Surprisingly, only two of these receptors, NDP52 and T6BP, impacted measles virus replication, although independently, and possibly through physical interaction with MeV proteins. Thus, our results suggest that a restricted set of autophagosomes is selectively exploited by measles virus to replicate in the course of infection. © 2017 by the authors.

The oxidation of biodiesel was promoted by an increase in oxygen concentration, resulting in a larger uptake of fuel in the rubber due to internal cavitation, a greater decrease in the strain-at-break of NBR due to the coalescence of cavity, and a faster increase in the crosslinking density and carbonyl index due to the promotion of the oxidation of NBR. During the high-temperature autoclave ageing, less fuel was absorbed in the rubber, because the formation of hydroperoxides and acids was impeded. The extensibility of NBR aged in the autoclave decreased only slightly due to the cleavage of rubber chains by the biodiesel attack. The degradation of NBR in the absence of carbon black was explained as being due to oxidative crosslinking. The dissolution of ZnO crystals in the acidic components of biodiesel was retarded by removing the inter-particle porosity and surface defects through heat treating star-shaped ZnO particles. The rubber containing heat-treated ZnO particles swelled less in biodiesel than a NBR filled with commercial ZnO nanoparticles, and showed a smaller decrease in the strain-at-break and less oxidative crosslinking. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

In particular, optimising the use of pesticides and having localised models of plant disease are the most important goals for the farmers of the future. The Trentino province in Italy is known as a strong national producer of apples. Apple production has to face many issues, however, among which is apple scab. This disease depends mainly on leaf wetness data typically acquired by fixed sensors. Based on the exploitation of artificial neural networks, this work aims to spatially extend the measurements of such sensors across uncovered areas (areas deprived of sensors). Achieved results have been validated comparing the apple scab risk of the same zone using either real leaf wetness data and estimated data. Thanks to the proposed method, it is possible to get the most relevant parameter of apple scab risk in places where no leaf wetness sensor is available. Moreover, our method permits having a specific risk evaluation of apple scab infection for each orchard, leading to an optimization of the use of chemical pesticides. © 2017 by the authors.

Considering how difficult Wi-Fi offloading in vehicular environments is, the bulk of this additional load will be served by cellular networks. Cellular networks, in turn, will resort to caching at the network edge in order to reduce the strain on their core network – an approach also known as mobile edge computing, or “fog computing”. In this work, we exploit a real-world, large-scale trace coming from the users of the We-Fi app in order to (i) understand how significant the contribution of vehicular users is to the global traffic demand; (ii) compare the performance of different caching architectures; and (iii) studying how such a performance is influenced by recommendation systems and content locality. We express the price of “fog computing” through a metric called price-of-fog, accounting for the extra caches to deploy compared to a traditional, centralized approach. We find that “fog computing” allows a very significant reduction of the load on the core network, and the price thereof is low in all cases and becomes negligible if content demand is location specific. We can therefore conclude that vehicular networks make an excellent case for the transition to mobile-edge caching: thanks to the peculiar features of vehicular demand, we can obtain all the benefits of “fog computing”, including a reduction of the load on the core network – reducing the disadvantages to a minimum. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, concerns exist about the psychological state of the platooning driver, who is exempted from direct control, yet remains responsible for monitoring the outside environment to detect potential threats. By means of a driving simulator experiment, we investigated the effects on recorded and self-reported measures of workload and stress for three task-instruction conditions: (1) No Task, in which participants had to monitor the road, (2) Voluntary Task, in which participants could do whatever they wanted, and (3) Detection Task, in which participants had to detect red cars. Twenty-two participants performed three 40-min runs in a constant-speed platoon, one condition per run in counterbalanced order. Contrary to some classic literature suggesting that humans are poor monitors, in the Detection Task condition participants attained a high mean detection rate (94.7%) and a low mean false alarm rate (0.8%). Results of the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire indicated that automated platooning was less distressing in the Voluntary Task than in the Detection Task and No Task conditions. In terms of heart rate variability, the Voluntary Task condition yielded a lower power in the low-frequency range relative to the high-frequency range (LF/HF ratio) than the Detection Task condition. Moreover, a strong time-on-task effect was found, whereby the mean heart rate dropped from the first to the third run.

Currently, a UAV is remotely controlled by a ground station through frequent data communications, which make the current system vulnerable in a threat environment. We propose a decentralized control strategy while requiring UAVs to maintain radio silence during the entire mission. The strategy is analyzed based on a scenario where a fleet of vehicles is assigned to search and collect uncertain information in a set of regions within a given mission time. We demonstrate that a region-sharing strategy is beneficial even when there is no extra reward gained from additional information collection. Implementing a region-sharing strategy requires solving a decentralized time allocation problem, which is computationally intractable. To overcome this, an approximate formulation is developed under an independence assumption for information collected by different vehicles. This approximate formulation allows us to decompose, by vehicle, the time allocation problem, and obtain an easily implementable policy that takes on a Markovian form. We develop a sufficient condition under which the approximate formulation becomes exact. A numerical study establishes the computational efficiency of the method; only a few CPU seconds are needed for problems with a planning horizon of 300 time units and 40 regions. We further present a case study to illustrate region-sharing behaviors among UAVs while using practical parameter values. Finally, we compare the obtained policy with the optimal policy found using a complete enumeration method for small instances.

Network information derived from dynamic analysis is frequently used for threat detection, network policy, and incident response. Despite these common and important use cases, the efficacy of the network detection signal derived from such analysis has yet to be studied in depth. This paper seeks to address this gap by analyzing the network communications of 26.8 million samples that were collected over a period of five years. Using several malware and network datasets, our large scale study makes three core contributions. (1) We show that dynamic analysis traces should be carefully curated and provide a rigorous methodology that analysts can use to remove potential noise from such traces. (2) We show that Internet miscreants are increasingly using potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) that rely on a surprisingly stable DNS and IP infrastructure. This indicates that the security community is in need of better protections against such threats, and network policies may provide a solid foundation for such protections.

High performance and extreme energy effciency are critical for deployments of CNNs, especially in mobile platforms such as autonomous vehicles, cameras, and electronic personal assistants. This paper introduces the Sparse CNN (SCNN) accelerator architecture, which improves performance and energy effciency by exploiting the zero-valued weights that stem from network pruning during training and zero-valued activations that arise from the common ReLU operator. Specifcally, SCNN employs a novel dataflow that enables maintaining the sparse weights and activations in a compressed encoding, which eliminates unnecessary data transfers and reduces storage requirements. Furthermore, the SCNN dataflow facilitates effcient delivery of those weights and activations to a multiplier array, where they are extensively reused; product accumulation is performed in a novel accumulator array. On contemporary neural networks, SCNN can improve both performance and energy by a factor of 2.7× and 2.3×, respectively, over a comparably provisioned dense CNN accelerator. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In order to do this, it is necessary to analyze real-time information, such as location, orientation, and size of objects. In particular, the ability to handle occlusion or truncation helps to ensure safe driving, by providing accurate information about the vehicle surroundings. In this paper, we propose a new method for generating object proposals around a vehicle, using projected LiDAR information, and performing object detection more accurately by exploiting a 2D imagebased classifier: Region-based Fully Convolutional Networks (RFCN). In other words, our method generates object proposals by filtering the LiDAR information into 2D edges having strong affinity. The object proposal is classified by R-FCN, and the resulting label is mapped to the edge points. This class label combines with orientation information of the edge in 3D space, in order to complete the 3D box of the object. This compensates the disadvantage of the charge-coupled device (CCD)-based R-FCN classifier, which demonstrates limitations in obtaining spatial information and in solving problems, such as occlusion. We compared our method with state-of-the-art results on the KITTI Dataset, and obtained good results in terms of speed and accuracy, especially in intersection-over-union (IOU) with ground truth. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we intend to classify motor imagery EEG signals by exploiting the fact that the space of SPD matrices endowed with Riemannian distance is a high-dimensional Riemannian manifold. To alleviate the overfitting and heavy computation problems associated with conventional classification methods on high-dimensional manifold, we propose a framework for intrinsic sub-manifold learning from a high-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Considering a special case of SPD space, a simple yet efficient bilinear sub-manifold learning (BSML) algorithm is derived to learn the intrinsic sub-manifold by identifying a bilinear mapping that maximizes the preservation of the local geometry and global structure of the original manifold. Two BSML-based classification algorithms are further proposed to classify the data on a learned intrinsic sub-manifold. Experimental evaluation of the classification of EEG revealed that the BSML method extracts the intrinsic sub-manifold approximately 5× faster and with higher classification accuracy compared with competing algorithms. The BSML also exhibited strong robustness against a small training dataset, which often occurs in BCI studies. © 2016 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The application environment causes numerous GNSS measurement outliers. Common implementations use a single epoch Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) combined with the Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) for GNSS outlier detection. However, if the linearization point of the EKF is incorrect or if the number of residuals is too low, the outlier detection decisions may be incorrect. False alarms result in good information not being incorporated into the state and covariance estimates. Missed detections result in incorrect information being incorporated into the state and covariance estimates. Either case can cause subsequent incorrect decisions, possibly causing divergence, due to the state and covariance now being incorrect. This article formulates a sliding window estimator containing multiple GNSS epochs. The approach solves the full-nonlinear Maximum A Posteriori problem with l1-regularization. By leveraging the resulting window of residuals from the nonlinear optimization, and exploiting the l1-regularization, an improved outlier accommodation strategy is implemented.

Resonant acoustic injection attacks are already known to cause malfunctions by disabling MEMS-based gyroscopes. However, an open question remains on how to move beyond denial of service attacks to achieve full adversarial control of sensor outputs. Our work investigates how analog acoustic injection attacks can damage the digital integrity of a popular type of sensor: the capacitive MEMS accelerometer. Spoofing such sensors with intentional acoustic interference enables an out-of-spec pathway for attackers to deliver chosen digital values to microprocessors and embedded systems that blindly trust the unvalidated integrity of sensor outputs. Our contributions include (1) modeling the physics of malicious acoustic interference on MEMS accelerometers, (2) discovering the circuit-level security flaws that cause the vulnerabilities by measuring acoustic injection attacks on MEMS accelerometers as well as systems that employ on these sensors, and (3) two software-only defenses that mitigate many of the risks to the integrity of MEMS accelerometer outputs. We characterize two classes of acoustic injection attacks with increasing levels of adversarial control: output biasing and output control. We test these attacks against 20 models of capacitive MEMS accelerometers from 5 different manufacturers. Our experiments find that 75% are vulnerable to output biasing, and 65% are vulnerable to output control. To illustrate end-to-end implications, we show how to inject fake steps into a Fitbit with a $5 speaker. In our self-stimulating attack, we play a malicious music file from a smartphone's speaker to control the on-board MEMS accelerometer trusted by a local app to pilot a toy RC car. In addition to offering hardware design suggestions to eliminate the root causes of insecure amplification and filtering, we introduce two lowcost software defenses that mitigate output biasing attacks: randomized sampling and 180° out-of-phase sampling. These software-only approaches mitigate attacks by exploiting the periodic and predictable nature of the malicious acoustic interference signal. Our results call into question the wisdom of allowing microprocessors and embedded systems to blindly trust that hardware abstractions alone will ensure the integrity of sensor outputs. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The widespread use of commercially available drones heeds warning to an increased need for vigilance these threats may possess for potential high-valued targets and critical sites. The depth of the solution obviously needs to be weighed against the possibilities of the threat and the potential of the threat to change over time. RF detection systems have a distinct advantage of reaction time along with a high probability of use. The actions and workflow of how to respond to a threat must play into how components of a defensive system can complement their actions for a complete solution. The careful consideration of the type of RF detection system must also consider the need to be able to sift through the myriad of RF signals in a dense spectrum environment and simultaneously reduce the false alarm rate. One needs to be able to tell the difference between a Wi-Fi signal someone turns on for their own personal hotspot and the Wi-Fi signal of a drone. As new signals appear and technology advances, skilled users should be able to define their own threats to be included in the classification database, or a service level agreement to renew and keep the database current with technology should be made available.

In the St. Lawrence Estuary (Canada), several whale species are threatened by navigation activities in various ways. Since 2013, seasonal voluntary ship strike mitigation measures, including a speed reduction area (SRA) and a no-go area, were implemented annually and largely adopted by the maritime industry to reduce the risks of lethal collisions with four species of baleen whales. While the endangered St. Lawrence beluga population is unlikely to be subject to collisions with large merchant ships, it is known to be negatively affected by vessel-generated underwater noise. To assess how these protection measures modify the beluga's soundscape throughout their critical habitat, we implemented an underwater acoustic module within an existing agent-based model (3MTSim) of ship-whale movements and interactions in the St. Lawrence Estuary. We ran multiple simulations for two scenarios 1) without and 2) with the protection measures to compare the level of noise received by belugas before and after 2013. Overall, the simulations showed a statistically-significant 1.6% decrease in the total amount of noise received by belugas in their critical habitat following the implementation of the protection measures. Although slowing down ships reduces instantaneous radiated noise, it also increases the total amount of acoustic energy released in the environment by extending the time spent in the SRA. Accordingly, our simulations showed a 2.4% increase in the cumulative noise from shipping received by beluga in the SRA. Conversely, belugas located in the Upper Estuary, mostly females and calves, i.e., the most valuable individuals experienced a 5.4% reduction in the cumulative received level of shipping noise. Although refinements are required to improve the modelling of noise sources and propagation for finer scale projections in this complex nearshore environment, this agent-based modelling paradigm of 3MTSim proved informative for underwater acoustic impact assessments. © 2017","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, current state-of-the-art tools in clinical practice, underpinned by the evaluation of elevation of the ST segment of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), do not identify all patients suffering from lack of blood flow to the heart muscle (cardiac ischemia), worsening the risk for further adverse events and patient outcome overall. In this study, we aimed to explore and compare the portions of cardiac repolarization in the ECG that best capture the electrophysiological changes associated with ischemia. We developed three-dimensional electrophysiological models of the human ventricles and torso, incorporating biophysicallybased membrane kinetics and realistic activation sequence, to compute simulated ECGs and their alteration with the application of simulated ischemia of differing severity in diverse regions of the heart. Results suggest that metrics based on the T-wave in addition to the ST segment may be more sensitive to detecting ischemia than those using the ST segment alone.

In this paper, we argue that roads and intersections should be recognized at the higher semantic level of road graphs - with roads being edges that connect nodes. Towards this goal we present a method consisting of two stages. During the first stage, we detect roads and intersections with a novel, dual-hop generative adversarial network (DH-GAN) that segments images at the level of pixels.

This approach is then used for the assessment of the steady state characteristics of a laboratory glider designed at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras. Flow behaviour and lift and drag force distribution at different angles of attack are studied for Reynolds numbers varying from 105 to 106 for NACA0012 wing configurations. The state variables of the glider are the velocity, gliding angle and angle of attack which are simulated by making use of the hydrodynamic drag and lift coefficients obtained from CFD. The effect of the variable buoyancy is examined in terms of the gliding angle, velocity and angle of attack. Laboratory model of glider is developed from the final design asserted by CFD.

Especially highly automated parking systems are currently in the focus of interest. When we aim at leveraging those systems in everyday parking scenarios, we should also be able to park on sidewalks and as such be able to traverse curbs. However, those use cases might then be a major challenge for vehicle control systems. Therefore, this paper describes the design of a control scheme for longitudinal vehicle dynamics control which is capable of performing on-curb parking while lateral vehicle dynamics control is assumed to be performed by a separate controller. We rely on a model predictive control scheme which exploits information of an extended Kalman filter for the purpose of disturbance rejection when parking on curbs. The estimator aims at determining the related road resistance forces in those scenarios. The proposed control concept is compared to a proportional-integral controller in five typical parking scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that with predictive control, we are able to finish parking faster, to avoid unintended stops and to better track the reference velocity. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) facilitates exchange of safety messages for collision avoidance, leading to self-driving cars. An AI system continuously learns to augment its ability in discerning and recognizing its surroundings. Such ability plays a vital role in evaluating the authenticity and integrity of safety messages for cars driven by computers. Falsification of meter readings, disablement of brake function, and other unauthorized controls by spoofed messages injected into VANET emerge as security threats. Countermeasures must be considered at design stage, as opposed to afterthought patches, effectively against cyber-attacks. However, current standards oversubscribe security measures by validating every message circulating among Connected Vehicles, making VANET subject to denial-of-service (DoS) Attacks. This interdisciplinary research shows promising results by searching the pivot point to balance between message authentication and DoS prevention, making security measures practical for the real-world deployment of Connected Vehicles. Message authentication adopts Context-Adaptive Signature Verification strategy, applying AI filters to reduce both communication and computation overhead. Combining OMNET++, a data network simulator, and SUMO, a road traffic simulator, with Veins, an open source framework for VANET simulation, the study evaluates AI filters comparatively under various attacking scenarios.

Motivated by this issue, we revisit the solution of multiclass closed queueing networks, which are popular models used to describe batch and distributed applications with parallelism constraints.We first prove that the normalizing constant of the equilibrium state probabilities of a closed model can be reformulated exactly as a multidimensional integral over the unit simplex. This gives as a by-product novel explicit expressions for the multiclass normalizing constant. We then derive a method based on cubature rules to efficiently evaluate the proposed integral form in small and medium-sized models.

Manipulations were task type, dual-tasking and event rate. Participants were required to discriminate human targets within a street scene from a direct video feed (threat detection [TD] task) and detect changes in symbols presented in a map display (change detection [CD] task). Dual-tasking elevated workload and distress, and impaired performance for both tasks. However, with increasing event rate, CD task deteriorated, but TD improved. Thus, standard workload models provide a better guide to evaluating the demands of abstract symbols than to processing realistic human characters. Assessment of stress and workload may be especially important in the design and evaluation of systems in which human character critical signals must be detected in video images. Practitioner Summary: This experiment assessed subjective workload and stress during threat and CD tasks performed alone and in combination. Results indicated an increase in event rate led to significant improvements in performance during TD, but decrements during CD, yet both had associated increases in workload and engagement. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The network is capable of reconstructing a full scene from a single depth image by creating a 3D representation of it and automatically filling holes and inserting hidden elements. We exploit the fact that our neural network is capable of generalizing object shapes by inferring similarities in geometry. Our fully convolutional architecture enables the network to be unconstrained by a fixed 3D shape, and so it is capable of successfully reconstructing arbitrary scene sizes. Our algorithm was evaluated on a real word dataset of tabletop scenes acquired using a Kinect and processed using KinectFusion software in order to obtain ground truth for network training and evaluation. Extensive measurements show that our deep neural network architecture outperforms the previous state of the art both in terms of precision and recall for the scene reconstruction task. The network has been broadly profiled in terms of memory footprint, number of floating point operations, inference time and power consumption in CPU, GPU and embedded devices. Its small memory footprint and its low computation requirements enable low power, memory constrained, real time always-on embedded applications such as autonomous vehicles, warehouse robots, interactive gaming controllers and drones. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Security is a fundamental challenge in the design of automotive systems. Unfortunately, security considerations in automotive systems are complicated by two factors: (1) need for real-time mitigation against in-field threats; and (2) in-field configurability and extensibility of security features. This paper examines the trade-offs between security countermeasures, real-time requirements, and in-field configurability needs for modern automotive systems.

Often, these drones are very lightweight and are flown in backyards, sport fields, parking lots, and such places. They typically pose no lethal threat to people in the vicinity of the drone. Nonetheless, in many countries such drones are regulated by aviation rules that does not (sufficiently well) distinguish between these drones and the larger hobby or professional drones. Consequently such small drones are flown illegally. This has prompted some national aviation authorities to consider a form of ‘harmless’ category, which ideally should be based on a mass threshold. To aid such a classification this work proposes a mass threshold of 250 g, below which, we argue, it is reasonable to classify drones as ‘harmless’ in the sense that the expected fatality rate is equivalent to that of manned aviation. In this work we combine a series of models and methods to provide a foundation for giving a mass threshold. The approach is probabilistic and focuses on the relation between mass and human injury in the case of small drones. The approach is also parameterized such that readers can substitute other probabilities and conduct their own calculations, possibly determining a different mass threshold. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The safety systems include from simple installation such as seat belt, airbag, and rear camera to more complicated and intelligent systems such as braking assist, lane change assist, steering control and blind spot monitoring. This paper proposes another intelligent safety system to be implemented in passenger vehicle by monitoring the blind-spot region by using automotive short range radar as sensor to assess its surrounding. This system is called Active Blind-Spot Assist (ABSA) system and this system will collaborate with a Steering Intervention system for autonomous steering maneuvers. The objective of ABSA system is to deploy safety interventions by giving warning to the driver whenever other vehicle is detected within the blind-spot region. Furthermore, this active system also triggers autonomous steering control when the potential of collision with the detected vehicle increases greatly. Consequently, a threat assessment algorithm is developed to evaluate the right moment to give safety interventions to the driver and the conditions for autonomous steering maneuvers.

In this paper, a sensor data collection strategy is proposed whereby an autonomous mobile sensor is guided to address such a problem with a high degree of accuracy and in a short amount of time. First, the parameters of the release source are estimated using the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling approach. The most informative manoeuvre from the set of possible choices is then selected using the concept of maximum entropy sampling.

The endpoint of these in vitro assays is represented by the phenotypic alterations in cultured cells, which are characterized by the change from the non-transformed to the transformed phenotype. Despite the wide fields of application and the numerous advantages of CTAs, their use in regulatory toxicology has been limited in part due to concerns about the subjective nature of visual scoring, i.e. the step in which transformed colonies or foci are evaluated through morphological features. An objective evaluation of morphological features has been previously obtained through automated digital processing of foci images to extract the value of three statistical image descriptors. In this study a further potential of the CTA using BALB/c 3T3 cells is addressed by analysing the effect of increasing concentrations of two known carcinogens, benzo[a]pyrene and NiCl2, with different modes of action on foci morphology. The main result of our quantitative evaluation shows that the concentration of the considered carcinogens has an effect on foci morphology that is statistically significant for the mean of two among the three selected descriptors. Statistical significance also corresponds to visual relevance. The statistical analysis of variations in foci morphology due to concentration allowed to quantify morphological changes that can be visually appreciated but not precisely determined. Therefore, it has the potential of providing new quantitative parameters in CTAs, and of exploiting all the information encoded in foci. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma and Edema are the ones in which OD detection finds the meaning and need. The method proposed here introduces a unique concept of fractal analysis in its own way, exploiting the geometric structure of eye called Pixel Based Multi Fractal Analysis (PBMFA). At the very outset the retinal fundus images are pre-processed employing a modified Contrast Limit Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) method. Furthering Mean Based Localization is carried out on the pre-processed image to locate the Region of Interest (ROI) over which further processes are carried out helping in improvising time complexity and efficiency of the algorithm developed. Modified Canny Edge detection leveraged with Gabor operator is performed over the ROI located, resulting in extraction of blood vessels from the retinal image. Pixel Based Multi Fractal Analysis is done locating the origin of vascular tree (center of the OD), based on the fact that it carries highest fractal dimension. This helps us locate the center most accurately followed by which OD of the retinal image is traced. This algorithm was implemented on DSK6713T making it a real time system and also an end product ready. Hardware implementation results in improvisation of the time complexity of the system too. An evaluation of the proposed algorithm was run over a set of 50 images each from STARE, MESSIDOR and DRIVE projects, containing images from both normal and pathological subjects. Detection and tracing of Optic Disc was found to be accurate up to 98.66%.

IoBT networks are significantly different from traditional IoT networks due to the battlefield specific challenges such as the absence of communication infrastructure, and the susceptibility of devices to cyber and physical attacks.

The path that encounters the highest porosity values determines the path from the point of origin to the goal position. The best trajectory is found using the reaction of the fluid in porous media obtained by the analytical solution of the PDEs representing the fluid flow. Constraints due to UAV dynamics, obstacles, and predefined way points are applied to the problem after solving for the best trajectory to find the optimal path.

High attack rates of influenza, for example, are typically seen in closed settings such as cruises, military vessels, aircraft, and institutions.'The high rates of infection in captive areas are influenced by number of people entering and exiting the place.

A representative off-the-shelf mini-UAV with a conventional configuration was selected. The main theme of this paper is to utilise FOLDERONS as a control effector (mainly in roll) to augment the control authority of conventional control surfaces. Furthermore, the impact of actuation rate on the effectiveness of FOLDERONS is assessed. The paper describes the preliminary and detailed design and sizing of the morphing wing. In addition, the manufacturing of the wing system and its integration with the UAV are addressed. Wind-tunnel testing in the RJ Mitchell wind-tunnel at the University of Southampton was performed. Both static (straight and sideslip) and dynamic (straight flight) tests are conducted at a range of airspeeds and Angles Of Attack (AOAs). The impact of folding wingtips on the lateral and directional stability is analysed. The main finding of this paper is that FOLDERONS are effective (especially at large dynamic pressure and AOAs) in controlling the lateral and directional stability. Finally, this study shows that FOLDERONS cannot fully replace conventional ailerons especially at low dynamic pressures, and their strong dependence on the AOA makes them prone to a roll reversal phenomena when the wing (and FOLDERONS) is operating at negative AOAs. © 2017 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"Dignity in people with frontotemporal dementia and similar disorders - A qualitative study of the perspective of family caregivers","2017","BMC Health Services Research","10.1186/s12913-017-2378-x","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021191412&doi=10.1186%2fs12913-017-2378-x&partnerID=40&md5=f12e15ea68007fa2d2ca604d94e1120e","Background: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) constitutes on average 10-15% of dementia in younger persons (≤65 years old), but can also affect older people. These patients demonstrate a decline in social conduct, and/or language aphasias, apathy, and loss of insight that is gradual and progressive. Preservation of dignity seems to be highly relevant both before and after admission to different types of institutionalized care, but the research is scant. From the perspective of close relatives, this study aims to develop knowledge related to dignified or undignified care of patients with FTD and similar conditions. Methods: A qualitative, descriptive, and explorative design were employed to address the aims of this study. We interviewed nine relatives of people with FTD and similar conditions living in nursing homes, and two relatives of people living at home but attending day center 5 days a week. Results: Relatives described the transition from being a close relative to someone who had little influence or knowledge of what constituted the care and the daily life of their loved ones. According to relatives' descriptions, patients are deprived of dignity in various ways: through limited interaction with peers and close relatives, limited confirmation of identity through staff who know them well, lack of possibilities for making autonomous decisions or entertaining meaningful roles or activities. Examples provided from the day care centres show how dignity is maintained through identity-strengthening activities conducted in different places, under various kinds of supervision and care, and together with people representing different roles and functions. Conclusions: Maintaining a link with the world outside the institution, through closer cooperation between the institution and family members, and/or by the use of day care centres, seems to facilitate prevention of many of the factors that may threaten dignified care. © 2017 The Author(s).","Review","Final","Scopus"

Methods: We used data and blood samples from the pretest phases of the German National Cohort, obtained from six of the 18 study centers (n = 1199). All centers applied standardized instruments including face-to-face interviews, anthropometric measurements and collection of blood samples. Self-reported histories of diabetes mellitus, heart attack and elevated blood cholesterol and/or lipids were recorded. Height, weight and blood pressure were measured. ANAs were detected using a semi-automated system (AKLIDES®; Medipan GmbH, Dahlewitz, Germany). A positive ANA was defined as a titer ≥ 1:80. ANA were classified as weakly (1:80 or 1:160), moderately (1:320 or 1:640) or strongly (≥1:1280) positive. Specific autoantibodies against nuclear antigens were detected with second-step assays according to the ANA staining pattern. Associations between the assessed disorders and ANA positivity and pattern were examined using sex and age-adjusted mixed-effects logistic regression models. Results: Thirty-three percent (95% confidence interval; 31-36%) of the 1196 participants (measurements could not be obtained from three samples) were ANA positive (titer ≥ 1:80). The proportions of weakly, moderately and strongly positive ANA were 29%, 3.3% and 1.3%, respectively. ANA positivity was more common among women than men across all titers (χ2, p = 0.03). ANA positivity, even when stratified according to height of titer or immunofluorescent pattern, was not associated with diabetes, elevated blood cholesterol and/or lipids, obesity or hypertension. Second-step autoantibody assays were positive in 41 of the 83 samples (49%) tested, with anti-DFS70 (n = 13) and anti-dsDNA (n = 7) being most frequent. These subgroups were too small to test for associations with the disorders assessed. Conclusions: The prevalence of ANA positivity in the German general population was similar to values reported from other countries. Contrary to other studies, there was no association with selected self-reported and objectively measured cardiovascular and metabolic variables. © 2017 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

To examine the complex interaction between the various layers of the system and verify the effectiveness of automation, difficult to obtain, realistic test systems are necessary. An algorithm for automatically synthesizing realistic medium voltage distribution feeders, and thus circumvent the data access problem, is presented. The algorithm treats distribution system feeders as graphs with nodes and edges, each with various properties, and leverages this structure to search for emerging statistical patterns. Using a large data set from a DSO in The Netherlands, clear statistical distributions are identified linking properties, such as load, node degree, or cable length, to the feeder structure. Specifically, many properties are linked to a node's or edge's distance, in hops, from the primary substation. With consideration for standard engineering practices, the statistical trends are exploited in the synthesis process, to generate feeders, which display similar characteristics to the real samples. The KL-divergence is used in the evaluation of analysis and synthesis results. Beyond solving the data access problem, the use of automatically generated, synthetic, distribution systems will enable testing and validation techniques, such as Monte Carlo simulations, which are currently not possible in this field, where single test cases are the norm. © 2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The approach uses the state-dependent coefficient form to capture the system nonlinearities into a pseudo-linear system matrix. The state-dependent coefficient form is derived following a rigorous analysis of aerial vehicle dynamics that systematically accounts for the peculiarities of such systems. The same state-dependent coefficient form is exploited for obtaining a nonlinear equivalent of the model predictive control. The nonlinear model predictive control law is derived by first transforming the continuous system into a sampled-data form and and then using a sequential quadratic programming solver while accounting for input, output and state constraints. The boundedness of the tracking errors using the sampled-data implementation is shown explicitly. The performance of the nonlinear controller is illustrated through representative simulations showing the tracking of several aggressive reference trajectories with and without disturbances. © 2017 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

At low advance ratios, large sections of the propeller blade can be stalled, and the Reynolds number faced by each blade can be low. This leads to difficulties in modelling propeller performance, as the aerodynamic models coupled with blade element methods usually only provide aerodynamic data for an assumed aerofoil section, for a small angle-of-attack range and for a single Reynolds number, while rotational effects are often ignored. This is specifically important at low advance ratios, and a consistent evaluation of the applicability of various methods to improve aerodynamic modelling is not available. To provide a systematic appraisal, three-dimensional (3D) scanning is used to obtain the aerofoil sections that make up a propeller blade. An aerodynamic database is formed using each extracted aerofoil section, across a wide range of angles of attack and Reynolds numbers. These databases are then modified to include the effects of rotation. When compared with experimental results, significant improvement in modelling accuracy is shown at low advance ratios relative to a generic blade element-momentum model, particularly for smaller propellers. Notably, when considering small propeller performance, efficiency modelling is improved from within 30% relative to experimental data to within 5% with the use of the extended blade element momentum theory method. The results show that combining Viterna and Corrigan flat plate theory with the Corrigan and Schillings stall delay model consistently yields the closest match with experimental data. © Copyright 2017 Royal Aeronautical Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Using WMSNs, the parameters of patients’ vital signs can be gathered from the sensor nodes deployed on the body of the patients and accessed by the healthcare professionals by using a mobile device. Due to wireless communication, securing communication becomes a vital issue in WMSNs. Since the vital signs parameters are sensitive to the patients’ health status and these information must not be revealed to the others except the healthcare professionals, the protection of patients’ privacy becomes another key issue for WMSNs applications. Thus, user authentication with anonymity property is the most basic and commonly used method in order to resolve the security and privacy issues of WMSNs. He et al. presented a user authentication protocol for healthcare applications using WMSNs to protect the security and privacy problems. However, Li et al. showed that their scheme is incorrect in authentication and session key agreement phase, has no wrong password detection mechanism and is vulnerable to denial of service caused by password change with wrong password. In this paper, we review Li et al.’s scheme and show that their scheme is still vulnerable to privileged-insider attack, sensor node capture attack and fails to provide user anonymity property. Moreover, we find that He et al.’s scheme is still vulnerable to the same attacks as we find out in Li et al.’s scheme. In order to remedy the security weaknesses found in both He et al.’s scheme and Li et al.’s scheme, we present a secure biometrics-based user authentication scheme in WMSNs using smart card. Through the rigorous formal and informal security analysis, we show that our scheme is secure against possible known attacks. In addition, we simulate our scheme using the most-widely accepted and used Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications tool and the simulation results reveal that our scheme is secure.

In this paper, an efficient stereo matching algorithm is implemented on a state-of-the-art GPU to achieve highly accurate disparity maps in real time for various autonomous vehicle applications. The proposed algorithm is developed from our previous paper, where the search range at row v is propagated from three estimated neighbourhood disparities located at row v + 1. In order to speed up the execution, the prevalent NCC algorithm is optimised by factorising the equation into five independent parts. The computations of hi, Hr, aj and ar are accelerated by using the integral images II, Ir, 12 and Ir2. The values of h and a are stored in static program storage for indexing during the stereo matching, which further reduces expensive calculations to help the system perform in real time. The main purpose of this work is to accelerate the processing speed by highly exploiting the parallel computing architectures (OpenMP and CUDA). The performance of the implementation on an NVIDIA GTX 970M GPU is compared with the performance of the implementations on an Intel Core i7-4720HQ CPU using both single thread and multiple threads. The experimental results illustrate that the GPU implementation yields 37 fps when processing the images (resolution: 1242 × 375) from the KITTI database, which is between two and nine times faster than the implementations on the CPU using a different number of threads. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Most of the existing tracking methods rely on either received signal strength (RSS) or phase shift alone. This paper presents a new RFID tracking method that fuses the RSS and phase shift together to predict the instant position of a mobile target. The fingerprints database is first constructed by collecting the RSS values at reference points. After data normalization, the fingerprints are fed into the extreme learning machine for the rough position estimation. The radial speed of the RFID tag can be calculated by measuring the phase difference between two consecutive time steps. Then, the linear least squares method is exploited to fit the instant speed of the mobile tag. On the assumption that the trajectory of the mobile tag could be approximated by a series of line segments, the Kalman filter is utilized afterward to enhance the position estimation by combing the rough location estimation and the instant velocity. The performance of our method is studied in simulations and experimentally verified in our lab. The results demonstrate that our method is feasible and achieves higher accuracy than traditional tracking methods. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this work we broaden the ways of engaging in ADR contracts users exhibiting different degrees of altruism and motivate them effectively to ultimately optimize the overall use of energy. We investigate the impact of altruism on the total incentives to be offered by the provider and the social welfare, and identify the optimal demand reduction and user targeting strategies for performing ADR in such populations. Based on experiments with real and synthetic data, we find that exploiting altruism can be beneficial for the social welfare of the system and the incentive costs of the provider. However, leveraging altruists should be performed carefully, since saddling them with high power reductions, although yielding lower total incentives, can prove inefficient for the social welfare of the system. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The controller is capable of producing high precision translational tracking using a linearized model of a trajectory error based on a quaternion attitude representation. This control contribution is general in the sense that it is agnostic of the underlying vehicle; the results are presented for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) experimentally, a spacecraft scenario in simulation, and a precision planetary landing scenario. The paper presents a full derivation from base principles, a proof of stability, and real-time repeatable experimental UAV results (25 tests per controller per scenario). These results show that the developed controller presented here is far more precise than the most common industry standard controllers, such as PID and classical LQR. The obtained results show the potential of this controller not only as an accurate and adaptable controller, but also in high precision trajectory tracking control. © 2017 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Clinical studies of metabolic modulators would provide some more information with regard to the feasibility of this approach. Furthermore, as it appears that oncogenic signaling is essential to this cancer’s altered metabolism, it stands to reason that targeting this altered signaling may allow the exploitation of specific metabolic vulnerabilities in combination with other drugs for enhanced efficacy.

As a prerequisite, how to reconfigure, energy-optimally or time-optimally, from the current formation to the desired one shall be planned beforehand. This paper addresses such a planning problem from the perspective of optimal control that exploits a direct sequential method. In our study, during the reconfiguration agents subject to nonlinear dynamics, and final formation constraints are imposed where there exist unknown parameters to be determined optimally. In the developed direct method the original problem is transcribed into a sequence of convex optimization problems via the control vector parameterization approach using piecewise-constant approximation. In the end, each instance in the sequence is essentially a programming problem (quadratic or linear) subject to linear constraints that can be solved very efficiently. In this paper, the proposed method has been applied to two scenarios: the energy-optimal reconfiguration of five UAVs and the time-optimal formation reconfiguration of four satellites. In our implementation the free open source solver CVX is used. By comparison with the global optimization technique provided in MATLAB, the solutions converge very fast to the global minimum. © 2017","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Therefore, the planner has to identify the UAV trajectories that minimize the Expected Time of Target Detection (ETTD) and nullify the total of NFZ overflights and of UAV collisions. To achieve it, the planner is backed by an ACOr that 1) ensures the feasibility of the trajectories by encoding them as a sequence of input UAV control commands and by decoding them through complex UAVs kinematic/dynamic models, 2) handles the uncertainty of the sensor and of the target location in the computation of the ETTD using Bayesian theory, and 3) improves the planning process with a heuristic that has been especially designed to exploit the probability and spatial properties of the problem.

Recently, a dynamic watermarking approach was proposed for detecting malicious sensor attacks for SISO LTI systems with partial state observations and MIMO LTI systems with a full rank input matrix and full state observations; however, these previous approaches cannot be applied to general LTI systems that are MIMO and have partial state observations. This paper designs a dynamic watermarking approach for detecting malicious sensor attacks for general LTI systems, and we provide a new set of asymptotic and statistical tests. We prove these tests can detect attacks that follow a specified attack model (more general than replay attacks), and we also show that these tests simplify to existing tests when the system is SISO or has full rank input matrix and full state observations. The benefit of our approach is demonstrated with a simulation analysis of detecting sensor attacks in autonomous vehicles. Our approach can distinguish between sensor attacks and wind disturbance (through an internal model principle framework), whereas improperly designed tests cannot distinguish between sensor attacks and wind disturbance. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

RGB imagery is used for the generation of a georeferenced 3D point cloud through digital image preprocessing, photogrammetric and computer vision algorithms. The point cloud is complemented with temperature values measured by the thermographic sensor and with intensity values derived from the RGB data in order to obtain a multidimensional product (5D: 3D geometry plus temperature and intensity on the visible spectrum). A segmentation workflow based on the proper integration of several state-of-the-art geomatic and mathematic techniques is applied to the 5D product for the detection and sizing of thermal pathologies and geometric defects in the mounting in the PV panels. It consists of a three-step segmentation procedure, involving first the geometric information, then the radiometric (RGB) information, and last the thermal data.

Interpersonal interaction, the process by which two or more people exchange information through verbal and nonverbal messages, could be exploited by robots both to establish interaction and to inform about its quality. The production of social signals being influenced by individual factors, such as personality traits, is critical for robots to have personalized models of interaction. This paper focuses on estimating social traits such as human personality from the dynamics of interpersonal interaction. The work was carried out in the framework of the project engagement during human–humanoid interaction which focuses on understanding individual factors influencing joint human–humanoid actions. In particular, this work addresses the automated prediction of the Extraversion trait during a human–humanoid interaction. We show how it is possible to take into account the specificity of human–robot interaction scenarios by contextualizing personality through the attitude that participants show towards the robots. This attitude is influenced by the a priori knowledge that people have on social robotics, and their prior anxiety in interacting with them. The proposed model exploits a set of nonverbal features chosen according to literature in Psychology and Personality Computing. These features are adopted to characterize human behaviors and the dynamics of human–robot interaction. Experimental results highlight that it possible to predict Extraversion of the human partner from nonverbal behavior during human–robot interaction with an accuracy of 62%. A higher accuracy, 70%, is obtained from the computational model by explicitly combining the dynamics of interpersonal interaction and the attitude of the participants towards the robots. Results show that 120 s are needed to obtain such performance. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","Scopus"

For time-critical cargo delivery tasks, UAVs need to be able to quickly navigate their environments and deliver suspended payloads with bounded load displacement. As a constraint balancing task for joint UAV-suspended load system dynamics, this task poses a challenge. This article presents a reinforcement learning approach for aerial cargo delivery tasks in environments with static obstacles. We first learn a minimal residual oscillations task policy in obstacle-free environments using a specifically designed feature vector for value function approximation that allows generalization beyond the training domain. The method works in continuous state and discrete action spaces. Since planning for aerial cargo requires very large action space (over 106 actions) that is impractical for learning, we define formal conditions for a class of robotics problems where learning can occur in a simplified problem space and successfully transfer to a broader problem space. Exploiting these guarantees and relying on the discrete action space, we learn the swing-free policy in a subspace several orders of magnitude smaller, and later develop a method for swing-free trajectory planning along a path. As an extension to tasks in environments with static obstacles where the load displacement needs to be bounded throughout the trajectory, sampling-based motion planning generates collision-free paths. Next, a reinforcement learning agent transforms these paths into trajectories that maintain the bound on the load displacement while following the collision-free path in a timely manner. We verify the approach both in simulation and in experiments on a quadrotor with suspended load and verify the method's safety and feasibility through a demonstration where a quadrotor delivers an open container of liquid to a human subject. The contributions of this work are two-fold. First, this article presents a solution to a challenging, and vital problem of planning a constraint-balancing task for an inherently unstable non-linear system in the presence of obstacles.

We address optical transport backbones and propose a novel method to reduce the energy consumed by dynamically adjusting the number of active optical carriers to support the short-term load of the network with a small and controllable margin. This is achieved in a nondisruptive manner that does not interact with routing strategies and does not rely on any specific control plane, but exploits automated traffic profiling and prediction of the well-known circadian traffic cycle. The proposed approach works with both fixed and flexible grid optical networks. We describe a method to automatically learn these patterns and multiple techniques to predict incoming traffic. Furthermore, we present an algorithm that tunes the parameters of the proposed system in order to achieve a target a posteriori probability of causing traffic losses. The behavior of the system is studied, using simulations, under a variety of conditions. Results show that the proposed prediction algorithms can significantly reduce the number of active optical carriers, even in nonoptimal scenarios, while guaranteeing low traffic losses. © 2016 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Climate and land use changes represent a threat to these forests if cloud base altitude rises as a result of regional warming or deforestation. To establish a baseline for quantifying future changes in cloud base, we installed a ceilometer at 100ĝ€m altitude in the forest upwind of the TMCF that occupies an altitude range from ĝ1/4 600ĝ€m to the peaks at 1100ĝ€m in the Luquillo Mountains of eastern Puerto Rico. Airport Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) ceilometer data, radiosonde data, and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite data were obtained to investigate seasonal cloud base dynamics, altitude of the trade-wind inversion (TWI), and typical cloud thickness for the surrounding Caribbean region. Cloud base is rarely quantified near mountains, so these results represent a first look at seasonal and diurnal cloud base dynamics for the TMCF. From May 2013 to August 2016, cloud base was lowest during the midsummer dry season, and cloud bases were lower than the mountaintops as often in the winter dry season as in the wet seasons. The lowest cloud bases most frequently occurred at higher elevation than 600ĝ€m, from 740 to 964ĝ€m. The Luquillo forest low cloud base altitudes were higher than six other sites in the Caribbean by ĝ1/4 200-600ĝ€m, highlighting the importance of site selection to measure topographic influence on cloud height. Proximity to the oceanic cloud system where shallow cumulus clouds are seasonally invariant in altitude and cover, along with local trade-wind orographic lifting and cloud formation, may explain the dry season low clouds. The results indicate that climate change threats to low-elevation TMCFs are not limited to the dry season; changes in synoptic-scale weather patterns that increase frequency of drought periods during the wet seasons (periods of higher cloud base) may also impact ecosystem health. © Author(s) 2017.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This letter establishes the utility of mobile relaying in facilitating secure wireless communications. In particular, we consider transmit optimization in a four-node (source, destination, buffer-Aided mobile relay, and eavesdropper) channel setup, wherein we aim at maximizing the secrecy rate of this system. However, the secrecy rate maximization problem is nonconvex and intractable to solve. To circumvent the nonconvexity, we exploit the difference-of-concave (DC) program to develop an iterative algorithm, which is proven to have Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point convergence guarantee. The algorithm conducts a water-filling-based solution in each DC iteration, and thus is computationally efficient to implement. In addition, for a given special case, we show that each DC iteration could yield a closed-form solution, which further reduces the computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mobile relaying scheme could significantly outperform the static relaying scheme in terms of secrecy enhancement. © 2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Motivated by this issue, we revisit the solution of multiclass closed queueing networks, which are popular models used to describe batch and distributed applications with parallelism constraints. We first prove that the normalizing constant of the equilibrium state probabilities of a closed model can be reformulated exactly as a multidimensional integral over the unit simplex. This gives as a by-product novel explicit expressions for the multiclass normalizing constant. We then derive a method based on cubature rules to efficiently evaluate the proposed integral form in small and medium-sized models. For large models, we propose novel asymptotic expansions and Monte Carlo sampling methods to efficiently and accurately approximate normalizing constants and likelihoods.

Multi-UAVs cooperation increases the scale of problems which cause a noticeable increase in task planning time. Moreover, it is difficult to build a unified assignment model because different tasks often require different numbers of UAVs and targets. Besides, the cooperative constraints of multi-UAVs in a three-dimensional environments are more complex than that in a two-dimensional environments, which makes it difficult to obtain an optimal solution. To solve these problems, we present a unified gene coding strategy to handle various models in a consistent framework. Then, a cooperative target assignment algorithm in a three-dimensional environments based on discrete mapping differential evolution is given. First, we use flight path cost to indicate the assignment relationship between the UAV and the target, which turns the optimization problem from discrete space to continuous space, and so the solving process can be simplified. Secondly, in order to obtain reasonable offspring for differential evolution, we map the solution back to the assignment relationship space according to inverse mapping rules. Finally, to avoid falling into a local optimal, a balance between exploration and exploitation is achieved by combining the dynamic crossover rate with the hybrid evolution strategy. The simulation results show that the proposed discrete mapping differential evolution algorithm with the unified gene coding strategy not only effectively solves the cooperative multi-targets assignment problem, but also improves the accuracy of the multi-targets assignment. It is also suitable for solving the large scale problem of assignment. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Article","Final","Scopus"

High performance navigation capabilities are ensured by equipping vehicles with high grade INS (Inertial Navigation System) aided by a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) among other sensors. For its nature, a DVL can work only within a limited range from the bottom precluding its use for deep water applications. This work analyses two different approaches to address the problem of deep water navigation. The first one is based on measurements of relative distance between different nodes (cooperating vehicles and a static gateway buoy) that constitute an acoustic underwater network. The second one is based on the data from a positioning system (the HiPAP system by Kongsberg) that is mounted on the support ship and that has a limited operational range. Results from the two approaches are evaluated based on the data collected during the COLLAB NGAS14 experimental campaign and processed off-line.

The proposed algorithm is applicable to vehicles that can be modelled with differentially flat dynamics, like unicycle and bicycle kinematics. The main idea is to exploit the flatness property so as to finitely parametrize trajectories, and design a set of motion primitives that represent optimal constrained trajectories joining two configurations in a grid space. A procedure to determine constrained (though sub-optimal) trajectories joining arbitrary configurations based on the motion primitives is then proposed. This eases and accelerates the construction of the tree to the purpose of online trajectory (re)planning in an uncertain environment, where the obstacle map may be continuously updated as the vehicle moves around, or unexpected events may occur and alter the free configuration space. © 2017","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

When vehicles localization systems involve standalone GNSS receivers, the resulting accuracy can be affected by satellite-specific errors of several meters. This paper studies how road-features like lane marking detected by on-board cameras can be exploited to reduce absolute position errors of cooperative vehicles sharing information in real-time in a network. The algorithms considered in this work are based on a error bounded set membership strategy. In every vehicle, a set membership algorithm computes the absolute position and an estimation of the satellite-specific errors by using raw GNSS pseudoranges, lane boundary measurements and a 2D georeferenced road map which provides absolute geometric constraints. As lane-boundary measurements provide essentially cross-track corrections in the position estimation process, cooperation enables the vehicles to improve their own estimates thanks to the different orientation of the roads. Set-membership methods are very efficient to solve this problem since they do not involve any independence hypothesis of the errors and so, the same information can be used several times in the computation. Such class of algorithm provides a novel approach to improve position accuracy for connected vehicles guaranteeing the integrity of the computed solution which is pivoting for automated automotive systems requiring guaranteed safety-critical solutions. Results from simulations and real experiments show that sharing position corrections reduces significantly satellite-specific GNSS errors effects in both cross-track and along-track components. Moreover, it is shown that lane-boundary measurements help reducing estimation errors for all the networked vehicles even those which are not equipped with an embedded perception system. © 2017","Article","Final","Scopus"

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply deep learning to the task of automated visual bovine identification. We show that off-the-shelf networks can perform end-to-end identification of individuals in top-down still imagery acquired from fixed cameras. We then introduce a video processing pipeline composed of standard components to efficiently process dynamic herd footage filmed by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). We report on these setups, as well as the context, training and evaluation of their components. We publish alongside new datasets: FriesianCattle2017 of in-barn top-down imagery, and AerialCattle2017 of outdoor cattle footage filmed by a DJI Inspire MkI UAV. We show that Friesian cattle detection and localisation can be performed robustly with an accuracy of 99.3% on this data. We evaluate individual identification exploiting coat uniqueness on 940 RGB stills taken after milking in-barn (89 individuals, accuracy = 86.1%). We also evaluate identification via a video processing pipeline on 46,430 frames originating from 34 clips (approx. 20 s length each) of UAV footage taken during grazing (23 individuals, accuracy = 98.1%). These tests suggest that, particularly when videoing small herds in uncluttered environments, an application of marker-less Friesian cattle identification is not only feasible using standard deep learning components - it appears robust enough to assist existing tagging methods. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The proposed framework is presented in the context of a motivating example of capture the flag which is an adversarial game played between two teams of autonomous agents called defenders and attackers. We start with the centralized formulation of the problem as a linear program because of its computational efficiency. Then we present an approximation framework in which each agent solves a local version of the centralized linear program by communicating with its neighbors only. The premise in this work is that for practical multi-agent systems, real time implementability of distributed algorithms is more crucial then global optimality. Thus, instead of verifying the proposed framework by performing offline simulations in MATLAB, we run extensive simulations in a robotic simulator V-REP, which includes a detailed dynamic model of quadrotors. Moreover, to create a realistic scenario, we allow a human operator to control the attacker quadrotor through a joystick in a single attacker setup. These simulations authenticate that the proposed framework is real time implementable and results in a performance that is comparable with the global optimal solution under the considered scenarios. © 2017","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Many researchers have sought for effective models that compute ship stochastic response during collisions by considering the variability of ship collision scenario parameters. However, the existing models were limited by the capability of the collision computational models and did not completely capture collision scenario, and material and geometric uncertainties. In this paper, a novel framework to performance characterisation of ships in collision involving a variety of striking ships is developed, by characterising the structural consequences with efficient response models. A double-hull oil carrier is chosen as the struck ship to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework. Response surface techniques are employed to generate the most probable input design sets which are used to sample an automated finite element tool to compute the chosen structural consequences. The resulting predictor-response relationships are fitted with suitable surrogate models to probabilistically characterise the struck ship damage under collisions. As demonstrated in this paper, such models are extremely useful to reduce the computational complexity in obtaining probabilistic design measures for ship structures. The proposed probabilistic approach is also combined with available collision frequency models from literature to demonstrate the risk tolerance computations. © 2017, Harbin Engineering University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Sensors can play a key role to improve safety and convenience in automotive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). A dramatic increase in connectivity and openness of the automotive CPS brings high security risks. If multiple and heterogeneous sensors equipped for braking and steering provides false sensing information for their controllers under deception attacks, it might cause catastrophic situations during driving. If the existing machine learning approaches are applied for sensor attacks while the majority of sensors is attacked, it cannot guarantee to identify deceptions as cyber-physical attacks. To address this problem, we propose an intelligent sensor attack detection and identification method based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques, called deep learning, without a prior knowledge about the deception attacks modifying sensing data in time. We investigate an autonomous vehicle with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and wheel encoder sensors under conditions of uncertainty and nonlinearity during driving.

To that end, the road-vehicle system is transformed into a polytopic LPV form which allows to deal with a large variation range of vehicle speed. Based on a robust static output feedback scheme, this method relies exclusively on commonly available vehicle sensors for control design and real-time implementation. Moreover, the information on the road geometry is incorporated in the control law to improve the lane keeping performance of the vehicle during curve taking. In particular, aiming to reduce the design conservatism, the limitation bounds on the vehicle acceleration are judiciously exploited in the design procedure through the use of a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function. The control design is recast as an LMI-based optimization with a line search over a scalar variable which can be effectively solved with numerical solvers. The effectiveness of the proposed lane keeping control method is clearly demonstrated by using the database of a real-world test track. © 2017","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In addition to understanding attacker and defender motives and tools, and identifying 'relevant' system and attack data, it is also critical to develop rigorous mathematical formulations representing the defender's decision-support problem under uncertainty. Game-theoretic approaches involving cyber resource allocation optimization with Markov decision processes (MDP) have been previously proposed in the literature. However, as is the case in strategic card games such as poker, research challenges using game-theoretic approaches for practical cyber defense applications include equilibrium solvability, existence, and possible multiplicity. Moreover, mixed uncertainties associated with player payoffs also need to be accounted for within game settings.

Multiple partially observable MDP (POMDP) problems are formulated and solved from a cyber defender's perspective, against a fixed attacker type, using synthetic (notional) system and attack parameters estimated from a Monte Carlo based sampling scheme.

It requires a comprehensive understanding of a vulnerability and delicate techniques to bypass defense mechanisms. As a result, attackers may prefer to reuse an existing exploit and make necessary changes over developing a new exploit from scratch. One such adaptation is the replacement of the original shellcode (i.e., the attacker-injected code that is executed as the final step of the exploit) in the original exploit with a replacement shellcode, resulting in a modified exploit that carries out the actions desired by the attacker as opposed to the original exploit author. We call this a shellcode transplant. Current automated shellcode placement methods are insufficient because they over-constrain the replacement shellcode, and so cannot be used to achieve shellcode transplant. For example, these systems consider the shellcode as an integrated memory chunk and require that the execution path of the modified exploit must be same as the original one. To resolve these issues, we present ShellSwap, a system that uses symbolic tracing, with a combination of shellcode layout remediation and path kneading to achieve shellcode transplant. We evaluated the ShellSwap system on a combination of 20 exploits and 5 pieces of shellcode that are independently developed and different from the original exploit.

The case study powertrain is discussed, and the dynamical model of the powertrain from the electric motor to the AMT output shaft, where it is linked to the torque coupler, is developed constituting the basis for the observer design. Given the fact that the aforementioned torques are unknown inputs to the system, they are modeled as state variables of a fictitious unforced linear time-invariant system in order to be aggregated into the systems dynamics. For the augmented system of the actual and fictitious states, a deterministic Luenberger observer and a stochastic Kalman-Bucy filter (KBF) are designed to estimate the synchromesh frictional torque and the output torque of the AMT. The estimation is based on measuring angular velocities of the electric motor and the AMT output shaft, together with the imparted electromagnetic torque of the traction motor on the system. A set of experiments with distinct scenarios is performed to compare the performance of the designed observers and to quantify by how much the KBF can improve the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the estimation by mitigating the effect of the process and measurement noises. Ultimately, after validation of the designed observers, the estimated value of the synchromesh frictional torque is exploited in a closed-loop feedback configuration in order to track desired trajectories such as step, ramp, and sinusoidal torque commands. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Threat assessment algorithms must be capable of predicting the future movement of other vehicles. Many algorithms, however, predict future trajectories based only on the model of the dynamics and the environment, which implies that they sometimes make too conservative predictions. This work reduces this conservativeness by capturing the driver intention of other vehicles using a random-forests classifier. Then, the algorithm computes possible future trajectories with a sequential Monte Carlo method, which biases the predicted trajectory by the recognized intention. Lastly, the algorithm calculates the potential threat to the ego vehicle. To evaluate the performance, we conduct numerical simulations and show that the proposed algorithm can accurately capture driver intentions and prevent motion predictions that are too conservative. © 2017","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

These data typically come in the form of a logical mask, generated manually or through automatic algorithms. The automatic detection of masks usually necessitates special features or reference points such as bright lines, high contrast objects, and sufficiently observable coherence between pixels. These are, however, not always present in experimental images necessitating a more robust and general approach. In this work, the authors propose a novel method for the automatic detection of static image regions which do not contain relevant information for the estimation of particle image displacements and can consequently be excluded or masked out. The method does not require any a priori knowledge of the static objects (i.e., contrast, brightness, or strong features) as it exploits statistical information from multiple PIV images. Based on the observation that the temporal variation in light intensity follows a completely different distribution for flow regions and object regions, the method utilizes a normality test and an automatic thresholding method on the retrieved probability to identify regions to be masked. The method is assessed through a Monte Carlo simulation with synthetic images and its performance under realistic imaging conditions is proven based on three experimental test cases. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

In view of an imminent or already occurring event, e.g. flood, that has the potential to stress and threaten populated regions, humanitarian supply chain management is a place where strategic decision making plays a major role. Sensible or strategic measures have to be developed in order to mitigate damages. Strategic measures should take into account available and possibly distributed resources, e.g. vehicles, storages and street networks, and of course the type of measure against the background of protection goals. Finding good or sensible measures becomes a hard task if the menaced region refers to a densely populated area, where the functionality of street network has a dynamic feature in terms of the emergence of blocked segments. This task gets even harder if the protection of certain critical infrastructures also has to be considered. Our work proposes a framework of a decision support system that is based on the synergetic coupling of a critical infrastructure and a traffic simulation module. By defining different event scenarios, different simulation runs can be triggered beforehand and according to the decision maker's preferences, sensible measures in terms of type of resources and routes are stored and displayed to the decision maker. Especially simultaneously occurring issues of different problem categories requiring decisions by various decision makers are addressed. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To support decision making in IAPs monitoring, semi-automated image classifiers which are capable of extracting valuable information in remotely sensed data are vital. This study evaluated the mapping accuracies of supervised and unsupervised image classifiers for mapping Harrisia pomanensis (a cactus plant commonly known as the Midnight Lady) using two interlinked evaluation strategies i.e. point and area based accuracy assessment. Results of the point-based accuracy assessment show that with reference to 219 ground control points, the supervised image classifiers (i.e. Maxver and Bhattacharya) mapped H. pomanensis better than the unsupervised image classifiers (i.e. K-mediuns, Euclidian Length and Isoseg). In this regard, user and producer accuracies were 82.4% and 84% respectively for the Maxver classifier. The user and producer accuracies for the Bhattacharya classifier were 90% and 95.7%, respectively. Though the Maxver produced a higher overall accuracy and Kappa estimate than the Bhattacharya classifier, the Maxver Kappa estimate of 0.8305 is not significantly (statistically) greater than the Bhattacharya Kappa estimate of 0.8088 at a 95% confidence interval. The area based accuracy assessment results show that the Bhattacharya classifier estimated the spatial extent of H. pomanensis with an average mapping accuracy of 86.1% whereas the Maxver classifier only gave an average mapping accuracy of 65.2%. Based on these results, the Bhattacharya classifier is therefore recommended for mapping H. pomanensis. These findings will aid in the algorithm choice making for the development of a semi-automated image classification system for mapping IAPs. © 2017","Article","Final","Scopus"

Most current approaches are based on either batch optimization or Bayesian filter, which require a good initial guess to obtain the optimal calibration results. In this paper, a two-step calibration algorithm is proposed for a fully automatic calibration of the camera-odometry system, consisting of: 1) a non-iterative auto initialization step for spatial extrinsic calibration based on the landmark measurements and 2) a joint optimization step to estimate both the spatio-temporal extrinsic parameters and the odometric parameters. By exploiting the planar constraints of landmark measurements, our auto initialization method can achieve better accuracy compared with the current solutions.

In order to facilitate the additional workload involved in ECG analysis due to prolonged monitoring times, we investigated the effectiveness of pAF detection with an automated software algorithm (SA) in comparison to the routine staff-based analysis (RA) during standard stroke-unit care. Therefore, patients with acute ischaemic stroke or transitory ischaemic attack presenting with sinus rhythmus on the admission ECG and no history of atrial fibrillation were prospectively included. Methods: A 24-h Holter ECG assessment was performed using either RA based on a computer-aided evaluation and subsequent review by a cardiologist or a commercially available automated SA. In the case of discordant results concerning the occurrence of pAF between the two methods, the data underwent an independent external rating. Results: Of 809 prospectively enrolled patients, 580 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pAF was ultimately diagnosed in 3.3% of the cohort (19 patients). SA and RA correctly diagnosed pAF in 17 patients resulting in a comparable diagnostic effectiveness of the analysis methods (sensitivity: SA 89.5% vs. RA 89.5%; specificity: SA 99.3% vs. RA 99.1%; κ, 0.686; P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.525–0.847). RA revealed clinically relevant ECG abnormalities in an additional seven patients. Conclusions: Although it should not completely replace RA, SA-based evaluation of Holter ECG reaches a high diagnostic effectiveness for the detection of pAF and can be used for a rapid and resource-saving analysis of ECG data to deal with prolonged monitoring times. © 2017 The Authors.

Integrating tens-to-hundreds of computing elements that run at lower frequencies allows obtaining impressive performance capabilities at a reduced power consumption, that meets the size, weight and power (SWaP) budget of automotive systems. Unfortunately, the inherent architectural complexity of many-core platforms makes it almost impossible to derive real-time guarantees using “traditional” state-of-the-art techniques, ultimately preventing their adoption in real industrial settings.

It is assumed that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperatively explore a static spatial field that can be represented with a few non-zero coefficients, i.e., the model of a process is sparse. The recovery of the sparse model in a distributed setting is solved with a Distributed LASSO (DLASSO) algorithm that implements an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Based on the cooperatively estimated model, a swarm of UAVs decides on its next movements using optimal experiment design strategies. To this end, second order information of the optimization problem is approximated using a theory of slantly differentiable functions. Also, an additional adaptive trade-off parameter between exploration of new areas and exploitation of the already obtained information is proposed and tested. The experiments are performed in a laboratory environment with two UAVs measuring a height profile with an ultrasonic sensor. The experiments show that the proposed method is very useful for time consuming measurements, if the observed process can be assumed to be sparse. Also, the adaptive method increases the overall system performance with respect to the number of measurements. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To increase SBA in rural, indigenous communities, a professional midwifery school accredited by the government is scheduled to open in 2017. Drawing from Filby's model on barriers to the successful integration of professional midwifery into health systems, this paper aims to identify threats - and facilitators-toward professional midwifery's re-introduction in Guatemala. Methods To elucidate perceptions, attitudes and expectations towards professional midwifery, qualitative, in-depth interviews were conducted with 32 physicians, nurses, and TBAs in six health centers and with key decision makers and professional midwives (PMs) in Guatemala City. We conducted open and axial coding in Atlas.ti and performed normative comparisons of participants’ attitudes, perceptions, and expectations with the National Vision for professional midwifery and relative comparisons within and across disciplinary subgroups. Results Unprompted, physicians, nurses and TBAs were unable to correctly define professional midwifery. Yet, when professional midwifery was defined for them, they expressed willingness to work with PMs, seeing them as a needed human resource, instrumental in providing intercultural care and strengthening facility relationships with TBAs. Some stakeholders anticipated resistance toward PMs due to provider turf issues. Notable differences in expectations among all groups included ideas for supervision of and by the PMs and the PM's role in monitoring women and conducting births in communities alongside TBAs. Conclusions Facilitators to professional midwifery's success include national political will, stakeholders’ uniformity of vision, and the potential for improved intercultural care. Barriers are mostly professional in nature, including impediments to autonomous practice by PMs, hierarchical challenges, and turf issues. A specific road map addressing the identified barriers is needed for professional midwifery to succeed in reducing maternal health disparities in Guatemala. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

They are also well known for their recreational value. Attempts to protect these ecosystems have not successfully stopped large-scale degradation. Significant efforts have been made by government and research organizations to ensure that coral reefs are monitored systematically to gain a deeper understanding of the causes, the effects and the extent of threats affecting coral reefs. However, further research is needed to fully understand the importance that sampling design has on coral reef characterization and assessment. This study examines the effect that sampling design has on the estimation of seascape metrics when coupling semi-autonomous underwater vehicles, structure-from-motion photogrammetry techniques and high resolution (0.4 cm) underwater imagery. For this purpose, we use FRAGSTATS v4 to estimate key seascape metrics that enable quantification of the area, density, edge, shape, contagion, interspersion and diversity of sessile organisms for a range of sampling scales (0.5 m × 0.5 m, 2 m × 2 m, 5 m × 5 m, 7 m × 7 m), quadrat densities (from 1-100 quadrats) and sampling strategies (nested vs. random) within a 1655 m2 case study area in Ponta do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve (Mozambique). Results show that the benthic community is rather disaggregated within a rocky matrix; the embedded patches frequently have a small size and a regular shape; and the population is highly represented by soft corals. The genus Acropora is the more frequent and shows bigger colonies in the group of hard corals. Each of the seascape metrics has specific requirements of the sampling scale and quadrat density for robust estimation. Overall, the majority of the metrics were accurately identified by sampling scales equal to or coarser than 5 m × 5 m and quadrat densities equal to or larger than 30. The study indicates that special attention needs to be dedicated to the design of coral reef monitoring programmes, with decisions being based on the seascape metrics and statistics being determined. The results presented here are representative of the eastern South Africa coral reefs and are expected to be transferable to coral reefs with similar characteristics.

The range in which depth values can be accurately estimated is usually limited for two-camera stereo setups due to the fixed baseline between the cameras. In addition, two-camera setups suffer from wrong depth estimates caused by local minima in the matching cost functions. Both problems can be alleviated by adding more cameras as this creates multiple baselines of different lengths and since multi-image matching leads to unique minima. However, using more cameras usually comes at an increase in run-time. In this paper, we present a novel embedded system for multi-baseline stereo. By exploiting the parallelization capabilities within FPGAs, we are able to estimate a depth map from multiple cameras in real-time. We show that our approach requires only little more power and weight compared to a two-camera stereo system. At the same time, we show that our system produces significantly better depth maps and is able to handle occlusion of some cameras, resulting in the redundancy typically desired for autonomous vehicles. Our system is small in size and leight-weight and can be employed even on a MAV platform with very strict power, weight, and size requirements. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

A wide number of publications have shown approaches exploiting solely high level features from processed sensor data. Looking at low level features, vision based systems offer high potential for the tasks of lane change detection in the image domain, like the positioning of objects relative to the lane markings or the evaluation of their movement towards adjacent lanes. Among conventional image processing algorithms deployed, optical flow is an appropriate approach towards the latter task, that is affected by translation and rotation of the ego vehicle. In this paper we introduce true flow as an addition to conventional optical flow. Translational and rotational influence of ego motion is eliminated, allowing to estimate solely the observed object behavior.

In this paper, we review the security objectives of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) and argue that AV is a kind of Cyber-Physical System (CPS) for control and operations of the vehicle. We attempt to identify the core issues of securing an AV by modeling an AV as a special kind of CPS, which tend to be implemented by a complex interconnected embedded system hardware. Subsequently, the technical challenges of AV security are identified. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Thereafter these designs are computer simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Some optimisation tools are used, at most, for the final fine-tuning. This paper proposes the use of a robust, efficient and automated optimisation methodology throughout the whole design process. The use of these methodologies can yield improved yet not conventional designs, while reducing the design cycle time. This paper presents the development of an original, general methodology based on a multi-attribute, structured optimisation, following a so-called Hybrid Direct Search (HDS), which combines genetic, gradient and swarm search intelligence. An example case study of a wind tunnel shape optimisation is presented. The main contributions of this paper are the exploitation of the concepts of variable hierarchy and variable value change (i.e. optimisation phases) and the HDS optimisation method, which allows for an intelligent and efficient direct search in complex aerodynamic problems in which the use of surrogate based optimisation is not accurate enough. This optimisation methodology is applicable to advanced aerodynamic design in cars, aircraft, high-speed trains, etc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Using RGB-D data collected by drones, we will be able to produce accurate 3D models and semantic maps with proper lighting co-supervised by human archaeologists. This is going to be a major advance in archaeological practice, which can accelerate the speed of archaeological exploits by extending the archaeologists' sight and perception range. This will enable us to conduct 3D analyses so that we may answer new questions and create new insights into the archaeological record. The archaeologists will be able to visualize data collected by drones and instruct the drones' next step in real-time. These data will also be important in site management, data sharing and visualization. Human/drone interaction becomes important, not only for operating the equipment, but also for guiding drones to areas of interest to be mapped. Maps or real-time 'fly-throughs' only make sense when they are organized by human interactions with the space. This human interaction is vital when visualizing and understanding a space and should be reflected in the imagery. We envision that this technology will be game changing in cave mapping and pertinent to anyone rendering interior spaces. It creates longer term impacts in archaeology and digital heritage and potentially creates a transformative way for further enhancing the performance of 3D mapping. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

V2X is known as a critical component for the vision of connected and autonomous vehicles in the future, with the goal of improving safety, saving energy, optimizing the traffic, etc. Many stake holders (e.g., 3GPP, IEEE) have announced the draft standards or technical reports that detail new opportunities of V2X-enabled vehicles for the cellular and automotive industries. However, the security issues in V2X communications receive little attention from industry and academia communities. In this paper, we describe how adversaries can exploit the security vulnerabilities to degrade the performance of V2X communications and evaluate the likelihood of V2X-specific attacks in undermining the road safety. Our investigation reveals that the existing security mechanisms fall short of addressing the key security threats, and we also discuss countermeasures by adding a security sub-layer for V2X communication protocols to provide V2X users with privacy, authentication, and confidentiality. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

VANET is aimed at maintaining safety to vehicle drivers by begin autonomous communication with the nearby vehicles. Each vehicle in the ad-hoc network performs as an intelligent mobile node characterized by high mobility and formation of dynamic networks. The ad-hoc networks are decentralized dynamic networks that need efficient and secure communication requirements due to the vehicles being persistently in motion. These networks are more susceptible to various attacks like Warm Hole attacks, denial of service attacks and Black Hole Attacks. The paper is a novel attempt to examine and investigate the security features of the routing protocols in VANET, applicability of AODV (Ad hoc On Demand) protocol to detect and tackle a particular category of network attacks, known as the Black Hole Attacks. A new algorithm is proposed to enhance the security mechanism of AODV protocol and to introduce a mechanism to detect Black Hole Attacks and to prevent the network from such attacks in which source node stores all route replies in a look up table. This table stores the sequences of all route reply, arranged in ascending order using PUSH and POP operations. The priority is calculated based on sequence number and discard the RREP having presumably very high destination sequence number. The result show that proposed algorithm for detection and prevention of Black Hole Attack increases security in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and reduces the effect of malicious node in the VANET.

The solution presented exploits models based on kernel functions with two main purposes: 1) to reject outliers; and 2) to correct or improve accuracy of measurements. The localization system discussed is based on well-established techniques such as support vector data description (SVDD) and autoassociative kernel regression (AAKR) derived from machine learning theory that utilizes heuristic models for classification and regression tasks, respectively. By coupling the algorithm to the navigation system, we seek to reduce the sensitivity of the localization scheme to the reflected acoustic waves or fluctuations of underwater channel properties without modifying the solution used for data fusion or overloading the algorithm embedded in the vehicle.

Finding the shortest end-to-end connected path satisfying delay restriction and minimal overhead is confronted with many constraints and difficulties. Such difficulties are due to the high mobility of vehicles, the frequent path failures, and the various obstructions, which may affect the reliability of the data transmission and routing. Commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or what are commonly referred to as drones can come in handy in dealing with these constraints. In this paper, we study how UAVs operating in ad hoc mode can cooperate with VANET on the ground so as to assist in the routing process and improve the reliability of the data delivery by bridging the communication gap whenever it is possible. In a previous work, we have proposed UVAR – a UAV-Assisted VANETs routing protocol, which improves data routing and connectivity of the vehicles on the ground through the use of UAVs. However, UVAR does not fully exploit UAVs in the sky for data forwarding because it uses UAVs only when the network is poorly dense. In this paper, we propose an extension of this protocol by supporting two different ways of routing data: (i) delivering data packets exclusively on the ground using UVAR-G; and (ii) transmitting data packets in the sky using a reactive routing based on UVAR-S. Simulation results demonstrate that the hybrid communication between vehicles and UAVs is ideally suited for VANETs compared to traditional vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Opportunities exist for remote sensing to bolster the restoration science associated with a wide variety of injured resources, including resources affected by fire, hydropower operations, chemical releases, and oil spills, among others. In the last decade, the role of remote sensing to support restoration monitoring has increased, in part due to the advent of high-resolution satellite sensors as well as other sensor technology, such as lidar. Restoration practitioners in federal agencies require monitoring standards to assess restoration performance of injured resources. This review attempts to address a technical need and provides an introductory overview of spatial data and restoration metric considerations, as well as an in-depth review of optical (e.g., spaceborne, airborne, unmanned aerial vehicles) and active (e.g., radar, lidar) sensors and examples of restoration metrics that can be measured with remotely sensed data (e.g., land cover, species or habitat type, change detection, quality, degradation, diversity, and pressures or threats). To that end, the present article helps restoration practitioners assemble information not only about essential restoration metrics but also about the evolving technological approaches that can be used to best assess them. Given the need for monitoring standards to assess restoration success of injured resources, a universal monitoring framework should include a range of remote sensing options with which to measure common restoration metrics. © 2016 SETAC.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Most educational centres in Spain do not have health professionals among their staff, and the teachers are in charge of child care in school. The advisability of specific training of the teaching staff should be considered, with the introduction of concrete intervention plans in the event of life-threatening emergencies in schools. Material and methods Evaluation of the training needs constitutes the first step in planning an educational project. In this regard, the Health Education Group of the Spanish Society of Clinical Immunology, Allergology and Paediatric Asthma (Grupo de Educación Sanitaria de la Sociedad Española de Inmunología Clínica, Alergología y Asma Pediátrica [SEICAAP]) assessed the knowledge of teachers in five Spanish Autonomous Communities, using a self-administered questionnaire specifically developed for this study. The data obtained were analysed using the SPSS statistical package. Results A total of 2479 teachers completed the questionnaire. Most of them claimed to know what asthma is, and almost one half considered that they would know how to act in the event of an asthma attack. This proportion was higher among physical education teachers. Most would not know how to act in the case of anaphylaxis or be able to administer the required medication. In general, the teachers expressed interest in receiving training and in having an interventional protocol applicable to situations of this kind. Discussion It is important to know what the training requirements are in order to develop plans for intervention in the event of an emergency in school. Teachers admit a lack of knowledge on how to deal with these disorders, but express a wish to receive training. © 2017 SEICAP","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, in today's scenario when technologies are advancing the accuracy of positioning systems, there are various new threats and challenges emerging. The signal receivers for positioning systems are prone to spoofing. This external interference in the system is usually done by feeding false signals to the receiver. Though the dead reckoning method is still in use, any interference with GPS can still lead to disaster. Insects and birds are known to use solar position for guidance and it is widely accepted by researchers that some birds, such as pigeons, use solar position in their homing flight. There are similar studies performed on honeybees and monarch butterflies. The use of solar position by these insects and birds brings up the question of whether a mathematical model can be used to replicate the results for aircraft navigation, and can a bio-inspired navigation algorithm like this be implemented? Solar position algorithms are already in wide use. The solar position algorithms available calculate the azimuth and zenith/incidence angles for the solar position at any given point of time when the position of the observer is known. The objective for navigation is to find an observer's position from solar position to present an alternative to GPS for navigational use. This document proposes a method for calculating the observer's position when the azimuth and zenith/incidence angles for solar position, attitude of aircraft and time are known. The approach proposed is that the position of the observer can be calculated by reversing the ENEA algorithm where instead of calculating the solar position using an observer's position, one will be calculating the position of the observer from solar position and time. The study includes the comparison of the calculated position of a UAS using the proposed method with the onboard GPS readings for both the ideal and the mimicked sensor accuracies for the position of the sun. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Cameras are particularly suited for this task, as the traffic relevant information of a scene is inferable from its visual appearance. In traffic scene understanding, semantic segmentation denotes the task of generating and labeling regions in the image that correspond to specific object categories, such as cars or road area. In contrast, the task of scene recognition assigns a global label to an image, that reflects the overall category of the scene. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN) capable of solving both problems in a computationally efficient manner. The architecture is designed to avoid redundant computations, as the task specific decoders share a common feature encoder stage.

In this study1, a data-driven approach was used to extract probabilistic models of the behaviours of other cars and exploit them to support a driving system based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The model selection component of the architecture infers which models better explain the current behaviours of the other vehicles using maximum likelihood estimation for Bayesian model comparison. The inferred behaviours are then used for MCTS-based control to prevent rollouts on models that are not relevant in the current context. While the use of multiple models allows improved efficiency and higher flexibility, it also introduces identification-related issues, which were solved here using Bayesian machine learning. The results obtained from the performed simulations are presented comparing the proposed MCTS architecture when employing multiple models with a naive model of the other vehicles. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Internet autonomous systems (AS) possess fixed IP prefixes, while packets carry the intended destination AS's prefix in their headers, in clear text. As a result, network communications can be easily identified using IP addresses and become targets of a wide variety of attacks, such as DNS/IP filtering, distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, etc. In this work, we explore an alternative network architecture that fundamentally removes such vulnerabilities by disassociating the relationship between IP prefixes and destination networks, and by allowing any end-to-end communication session to have dynamic, short-lived, and pseudo-random IP addresses drawn from a range of IP prefixes rather than one. The concept is seemingly impossible to realize in todays Internet. We demonstrate how this is doable today with three different strategies using software defined networking (SDN), and how this can be done at scale to transform the Internet addressing and routing paradigms with the novel concept of a distributed software defined Internet exchange (SDX). The solution works with both IPv4 and IPv6, whereas the latter provides higher degrees of IP addressing freedom. Prototypes based on Open vSwitches (OVS) have been implemented for experimentation across the PEERING BGP testbed. The SDX solution not only provides a technically sustainable pathway towards large-scale traffic analysis resistant network (TARN) support, it also unveils a new business model for customer-driven, customizable and trustable end-to-end network services. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

MmWave needs array gain for the best performance, but this requires correctly pointing the beam, known as beam alignment. Dynamic blockages make beam alignment challenging in the vehicular setting. This paper proposes to leverage a vehicle's position along with past beam measurements to rank desirable pointing directions that can reduce the required beam training to a small set of pointing directions. The ranking is conducted using a learning-to-rank approach, which is a popular machine learning method used in recommender systems. The learning uses a kernel based model, and a new metric for evaluating ranked lists of pointing directions tailored to beam alignment is proposed.

In particular, we consider a basic two-user scenario, and investigate how the UAV can optimally exploit its mobility via trajectory design to maximize the amount of energy transferred to the two ERs during a finite charging period. We characterize the achievable energy region of the two ERs, by optimizing the UAV's trajectory subject to a maximum speed constraint. We show that when the distance between the two ERs is smaller than a certain threshold, the Pareto boundary of the energy region is achieved when the UAV hovers above a fixed location between them during the whole charging period; while when their distance is larger than the threshold, to achieve the boundary of the energy region, the UAV in general needs to hover and fly between two different locations above the line connecting them. Numerical results show that the optimized UAV trajectory can significantly improve the WPT efficiency and fairness of the two ERs, especially when the UAV's maximum speed is large and/or the charging duration is long. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Two common drawbacks for the integration of commercial MHP systems into low-cost sUAS are that 1) the MHP airdata system cost can be several times that of the sUAS airframe; and 2) when extended from the airframe, the pressure-measuring probe is often exposed to damage during normal operations. A flush airdata system (FADS) with static pressure sensing ports mounted flush with the airframe skin provides an alternative to the MHP system. This project implements a FADS with multiple static pressure sensors located at selected locations on the airframe. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are used to determine the airframe locations with the highest pressure change sensitivity to changes in the airframe angle of attack and sideslip angle. Wind tunnel test results are reported with nonlinear least squares and neural networks regression methods applied to the pressure measurements to estimate the instantaneous angle of attack and sideslip. Both methods achieved mean errors of less than 18. A direct comparison of the regression methods show that the neural network method provides a more accurate relative wind angle estimate than the nonlinear least squares method. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) is well suited to focus on the late steps of exocytosis at the plasma membrane. However, it is still a challenging task to quantify (lateral) diffusion and estimate local dynamics of proteins. Results: A new model was introduced to represent the behavior of cargo transmembrane proteins during the vesicle fusion to the plasma membrane at the end of the exocytosis process. Two biophysical parameters, the diffusion coefficient and the release rate parameter, are automatically estimated from TIRFM image sequences, to account for both the lateral diffusion of molecules at the membrane and the continuous release of the proteins from the vesicle to the plasma membrane. Quantitative evaluation on 300 realistic computer-generated image sequences demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of the method. The application of our method on 16 real TIRFM image sequences additionally revealed differences in the dynamic behavior of Transferrin Receptor (TfR) and Langerin proteins. Conclusion: An automated method has been designed to simultaneously estimate the diffusion coefficient and the release rate for each individual vesicle fusion event at the plasma membrane in TIRFM image sequences. It can be exploited for further deciphering cell membrane dynamics. © 2017 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, a UAV with path length limitation is considered to provide communication service to WTs in a disaster area, a part of WTs can communicate with the UAV directly, and other WT communication with the UAV indirectly through D2D relay transmissions to reduce the UAV path length. Aiming at decreasing the total energy consumption of WTs, a novel UAV-aided data communicate method, ECO-UDC, is introduced.

Individual factors associated with attacks, such as poor symptom control, are not robust predictors. Objective We investigated whether the rich data available in UK electronic medical records could identify patients at risk of recurrent attacks. Methods We analyzed anonymized, longitudinal medical records of 118,981 patients with actively treated asthma (ages 12-80 years) and 3 or more years of data. Potential risk factors during 1 baseline year were evaluated using univariable (simple) logistic regression for outcomes of 2 or more and 4 or more attacks during the following 2-year period. Predictors with significant univariable association (P <.05) were entered into multiple logistic regression analysis with backward stepwise selection of the model including all significant independent predictors. The predictive accuracy of the multivariable models was assessed. Results Independent predictors associated with future attacks included baseline-year markers of attacks (acute oral corticosteroid courses, emergency visits), more frequent reliever use and health care utilization, worse lung function, current smoking, blood eosinophilia, rhinitis, nasal polyps, eczema, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obesity, older age, and being female. The number of oral corticosteroid courses had the strongest association. The final cross-validated models incorporated 19 and 16 risk factors for 2 or more and 4 or more attacks over 2 years, respectively, with areas under the curve of 0.785 (95% CI, 0.780-0.789) and 0.867 (95% CI, 0.860-0.873), respectively.

Predictions of this sort help a robot anticipate the future, for example, in throttling speeds as it rounds a bend. After examining how to reparameterize standard filters to incorporate this model, we compare the performance of three Gaussian filters and show that nonideality and theoretical challenges (of non-linearity, multi-modality/periodicity) degrade the performance of standard Kalman filters severely, but can be successfully mitigated by imposing an interval constraint.

New One Time Pad (OTP) algorithm was designed for high bit rate and high security level applications such as UAV Data Link.

Authenticated Encryption (AE) is a very important technique that ensures complete security procedures of transported data. This technique combines encryption, authentication and data integrity to provide both privacy and authenticity of the data. In this paper, the design, analysis and simulation of a fast and enhanced stream cipher Authenticated Encryption architecture which is called Authenticated Encryption New OTP (AENOTP) is introduced on the basis of unpredictability concept. Unpredictability concept is a concept based on dynamic use of encryption algorithms, where instead of using single encryption algorithm for producing the ciphertext, multiple encryption algorithms are used in the same structure.

In this article, we propose a modeling and quantitative analysis method of safety requirements which integrates the safety patterns, extended misuse case analysis and evaluation method based on the Bayesian networks. In automotive software systems, the threats to the safety include not only external factors from outside the automobile, but also internal factors such as a driver's erroneous operation. The proposed method enables to analyze both internal and external factors of the system as the hazards to the safety of the systems. First, we define safety a set of patterns as a pair of a cause and the mitigation use cases in order to prevent hazards. With the safety patterns, we can identify a set of mitigation points. Then, we analyze extended misuse cases, which enables to identify hazards to the system failures, and mitigation use cases from the misuse case scenarios. Finally, with the Bayesian networks, we quantitatively evaluate the effect of safety requirements by comparing the accident probability of before and after the application of mitigation use cases.

Although prior works have demonstrated the performance improvement brought by the UAV mobility, they mainly focus on the delay-tolerant applications such as file transfer and data collection. As such, it is unknown if the UAV mobility is able to provide performance gain for delay-constrained applications, such as video conferencing and online gaming. Motivated by this, we study in this paper a UAV-enabled downlink orthogonal division multiple access (OFDMA) network where a UAV is dispatched to serve two ground users within a given flight period. By taking into account the delay-specified minimum-rate-ratio constraints of the users, our goal is to maximize the minimum user throughput by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and communication resource allocation. We show that the max-min user throughput in general decreases as the minimum-rate-ratio constraints become more stringent, which reveals a fundamental tradeoff between the throughput gain by exploiting the UAV mobility and the user delay requirement.

The delay tolerant multiple access control protocol which is called UD-MAC1, is designed for UAV networks. The UD-MAC exploits the returning UAVs to store and carry the data of the UAVs along the returning paths to the destination. The returning UAVs are discovered by ground via the Control and Non-Payload Communication (CNPC) links, which contain the sense and avoid information among UAVs.

Embedded software companies are under huge pressure to produce safe applications that limit risks, and testing is absolutely critical to alleviate concerns regarding safety and user privacy. This requires using large test suites throughout the development process, increasing time-to-market and ultimately hindering competitivity. Speeding up test execution is, therefore, of paramount importance for embedded software developers. This is traditionally achieved by running, in parallel, multiple tests on large-scale clusters of computers. However, this approach is costly in terms of infrastructure maintenance and energy consumed, and is at times inconvenient as developers have to wait for their tests to be scheduled on a shared resource. We propose to look at exploiting GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) for running embedded software testing. GPUs are readily available in most computers and offer tremendous amounts of parallelism, making them an ideal target for embedded software testing. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, how test executions of embedded C programs can be automatically performed on a GPU, without involving the end user. We take a compiler-assisted approach which automatically compiles the C program into GPU kernels for parallel execution of the input tests. Using this technique, we achieve an average speedup of 16×when compared to CPU execution of input tests across nine programs from an industry standard embedded benchmark suite. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Best control can be achieved by directly controlling the individual rotor thrust forces, which, during flight, can only be estimated. An identification of the thrust generation mechanism, and subsequent exploitation of this relation in the quadrotor's command chain is therefore crucial. In this work, the relationship between a given angular velocity command and actual thrust of each individual rotor is modeled as a Wiener model, consisting of a linear dynamic first-order plus time delay element and a static nonlinear second order polynomial. Parameters are identified experimentally using a propeller thrust scale and measurements of the true rotor speed. In addition, an inflight calibration procedure is proposed for compensation of varying system and environment parameters. The command structure is then implemented on a quadrotor employed with a flatness-based controller, and indoor flights in a tracking cell show a low mean error of 0.2 m/s2 between commanded and true acceleration.

In order to compute an optimal plan, the agent must accurately predict the actions of the other agents, since they influence the state of the environment and ultimately the agent’s utility. To do so, we propose a special case of interactive partially observable Markov decision process, in which the agent does not explicitly model the other agents’ beliefs and preferences, and instead represents them as stochastic processes implemented by probabilistic deterministic finite state controllers (PDFCs). The agent maintains a probability distribution over the PDFC models of the other agents, and updates this belief using Bayesian inference. Since the number of nodes of these PDFCs is unknown and unbounded, the agent places a Bayesian nonparametric prior distribution over the infinitely dimensional set of PDFCs. This allows the size of the learned models to adapt to the complexity of the observed behavior. Deriving the posterior distribution is in this case too complex to be amenable to analytical computation; therefore, we provide a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that approximates the posterior beliefs over the other agents’ PDFCs, given a sequence of (possibly imperfect) observations about their behavior. Experimental results show that the learned models converge behaviorally to the true ones. We consider two settings, one in which the agent first learns, then interacts with other agents, and one in which learning and planning are interleaved. We show that the agent’s performance increases as a result of learning in both situations. Moreover, we analyze the dynamics that ensue when two agents are simultaneously learning about each other while interacting, showing in an example environment that coordination emerges naturally from our approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an agent can exploit the learned models to perform indirect inference over the state of the environment via the modeled agent’s actions. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

This requires continuous cooperation between the vehicles by efficiently sharing safety information in a timely manner. However, this is a multi-dimensional and challenging problem due to the complex nature of the vehicular environment. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an elegant solution to efficiently share the safety information among vehicles by using only Basic Safety Messages (BSM), which are part of the existing V2V standards. Through this research, the vehicles are able to quickly and preemptively identify potential threats, not only in their close proximity, but also those which are further along the roadway by intelligently exchanging safety information between neighboring vehicles. Additionally, for the first time, the proposed architecture presents a practical approach of incorporating the onboard sensor data with the V2V communications.

This analysis can be used to either uniquely identify a driver or differentiate him/her from other drivers. Driver behavioral analysis has practical applications in insurance, safety and security. Autonomous vehicle controllers are software systems that are static by nature. This implies that while driver behavior analysis can be carried out on autonomous vehicles, the unique driving patterns that can be used to differentiate human drivers will not be possible with autonomous vehicles controlled by the same agent. This scenario is undesirable from a security viewpoint. It is widely accepted that the predictability of software systems makes them vulnerable, this is more so if a large of number of users utilize the software system. Based on the above, in this paper, we argue for the necessity of creating diversity in the driving behavior of autonomous vehicles. We present a conceptual framework that lays out how this can be accomplished at low cost, with high flexibility and without compromising one of the major advantages of autonomous vehicles - safety. Using the example of a remote vehicle hijack, an attack scenario that has shown to be practical in recent times, we highlight an application of our proposed model. We show how having diverse behavior is advantageous in creating a fail-safe remote vehicle hijack detection system. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Based on fuzzy logic, a predictor–corrector guidance law is proposed in this paper, where the trajectory prediction is realized by numerical integration. The correction system consists of two fuzzy controllers, which correct longitudinal motion and lateral motion synergistically. A drag acceleration profile is designed through interpolating between upper drag boundary and lower drag boundary, which is corrected continually to eliminate the range error. Attack angle, a secondary control variable in the paper, is used to eliminate the altitude error. In addition, the lateral error is removed by regulating the reversal time of bank angle. Compared with the traditional guidance laws, the method in this paper not only can correct synergistically the longitudinal motion and lateral motion of the vehicle, but also can easily cope with the flight constraints using interpolated drag acceleration profile. Moreover, in a correction cycle, the method designed in this paper only needs a single trajectory prediction, which reduces the on-board computation. The guidance law demonstrates a high precision and robustness in the simulation scenario. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Article","Final","Scopus"

Unfortunately, because of the increased vehicular mobility, they require frequent antenna beam realignments-thus significantly increasing the in-band Beamforming (BF) overhead. In this paper, we propose Smart Motion-prediction Beam Alignment (SAMBA), a MAC-layer algorithm that exploits the information broadcast via DSRC beacons by all vehicles. Based on these information, overhead-free BF is achieved by estimating the position of the vehicle and predicting its motion. Moreover, adapting the beamwidth with respect to the estimated position can further enhance the performance. Our investigation shows that SAMBA outperforms the IEEE 802.11ad BF strategy, increasing the data rate by more than twice for sparse vehicle density while enhancing the network throughput proportionally to the number of vehicles. Furthermore, SAMBA was proven to be more efficient compared to legacy BF algorithm under highly dynamic vehicular environments and hence, a viable solution for future ITS services. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The objective is to exploit the mobility of UAVs in order to establish routing paths and transfer a message between two ground nodes at minimum transmission time. Assuming that the UAVs are already deployed to execute a given primary task, the cooperation of the UAVs in the data transfer process, considered as a secondary task, becomes subject to three conditions. First, the energy consumed by each UAV has to respect the allocated budget for the data routing process. Second, the UAVs cannot move out of the boundaries of a tolerated and well-defined region in order to maintain the operation of the primary task. Finally, the UAVs need to reduce their traveled distances in order to reduce the delay of the transfer. A mixed non-linear integer programming problem determining the routing path and the new locations of the UAVs participating in the data transfer process is formulated. Due to its non-convexity, we proceed with a deterministic exploratory strategy inspired from the Hooke-Jeeves algorithm to meet the problem goals. Selected numerical results investigate the performance of the proposed solution for different scenarios and compare some of them to those of a meta-heuristic approach based on swarm intelligence. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To compensate the effects of the Earth's rotation, the pseudo-aerodynamic forces are introduced as the fusions of the aerodynamic forces and inertial forces due to the Earth's rotation. To avoid drastic changes in Angle of Attack (AOA) and bank angle, we carefully forecast the change trends of the inertial forces and then design the pseudo-aerodynamic profiles as inversely proportional functions. Here a complex but useful identity is found and proved theoretically, which helps to simplify the pseudo-aerodynamic profiles without losing accuracy significantly. Subsequently, new 3-D analytical glide formulas are derived for these inversely-proportional profiles and then used to determine the profile parameters and bank reversals. Due to the careful design, the guidance is capable of steering the high-L/D vehicle to any place on the Earth accurately while achieving almost constant commands during the steady glide phase, a major phase of flight. The superior performance of the guidance is verified by the Monte Carlo simulations with challenging disturbances including initial state dispersions, aerodynamic uncertainties, and atmospheric perturbations. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Article","Final","Scopus"

This must be achieved with minimal impact on system performance while maintaining low implementation overhead and high coverage of multi-parameter failure mechanisms. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning framework for on-line control law adaptation in autonomous nonlinear systems assisted by system state encodings. These encodings are exploited to generate time-varying error signals whose (transient) waveforms in relation to the input stimulus, contain root-cause diagnostic information. This establishes a statistical correlation between the transient waveforms and the parameters of the optimal nonlinear controller under arbitrary multi-parameter perturbations of sensor/actuator and subsystem performances. Consequently this correlation is tapped, using pre-deployment supervised learning algorithms, to predict near-optimal controller parameter values whenever sufficiently large parameter deviations are detected (due to non-zero error signals). From these near-optimal starting conditions, an actor-critic reinforcement learning controller for nonlinear systems quickly converges to the optimal control law for the parameter-perturbed system (up to 10× faster than for systems not assisted by the diagnostic information provided by the state encoding driven error signal above). We implement the proposed methodology on two nonlinear systems demonstrating fast performance recovery in real time. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Second, there may be adversarial agents seeking to disrupt connectivity through targeted jamming in 3D spaces. Third, we assume an overlay software defined control plane, where the UAVs function as software switches, able to execute forwarding commands and determine preferred routes under controller directives.

However, progress in some areas is much faster than in others. For example, in-vehicle self-driving systems are evolving rapidly, but development of intelligent road systems is relatively sluggish. These systems are beginning to interconnect and interoperate to become complex systems-of-systems for which attack surfaces and vulnerabilities are expanding exponentially. Many of these systems are standalone and proprietary and do not interoperate. However, systems must be seamlessly integrated if we are to arrive at safe and secure fully-autonomous road vehicles. If we do not create broad standards early on, we can expect vulnerabilities to grow so much that they could overwhelm potential benefits from improved safety and fuel economies. Warnings about cybersecurity consequences of such complexities appear from time to time in academic publications and the popular press, but few companies and government agencies do not seem to heed these admonitions and suggestions. Meanwhile, the self-driving juggernaut ploughs ahead. Here, we identify likely cybersecurity consequences that will arise because current efforts reflect uncoordinated design and development, particularly of supporting infrastructure systems. We describe how such risks might be mitigated proactively by introducing cybersecurity requirements early in the design, development and deployment processes. We also discuss how we might establish universal automotive and transportation security and safety standards that are enforceable and can be enforced globally across in-vehicle and ex-vehicle systems. While we see impressive near-term advances, particularly with in-vehicle systems and vehicle-to-vehicle systems, such innovations will eventually hit a roadblock if infrastructure systems, both physical and cyber, do not receive the attention required to achieve acceptable levels of cybersecurity and safety. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

An overall COMPA autonomic control loop can orchestrate functions, themselves implemented as COMPA autonomic loops. Thus the COMPA automation patter can recurse right down to resource level in a network. One of the most exciting application areas for the COMPA automation pattern is in assuring mobile network security. The recursive nature of the pattern is the ideal mechanism for automating monitoring and root cause analysis of security threats to networks. In this paper we present a Proof of Concept of a COMPA compliant system for a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) scenario. The system monitors, performs root cause analysis, and mitigates a DDoS attack. The system was built by integrating a number of existing components that were deployed as VNFs. Our experiences of using the system were that the system could handle a DDoS attack quickly and automatically. In addition, the system was very flexible to build and deploy. © 2017 IFIP.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Nevertheless, pseudonym distribution and management affect PPKI scalability due to the significant number of digital certificates required by a single vehicle. In this paper, we focus on the certificate revocation process and propose a versatile and low-complexity framework to facilitate the distribution of the Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) issued by the Certification Authority (CA). CRL compression is achieved through optimized Bloom filters, which guarantee a considerable overhead reduction with a configurable rate of false positives.

With the advent of autonomous vehicles, there will be several actors that adapt to changes in traffic, and decentralized adaptation will be a new type of issue that needs to be studied. This chapter investigates the effects of adaptive route planning when real-time online traffic information is exploited. Simulation results show that if the agents selfishly optimize their actions, then in some situations the ubiquitous IoT system may fluctuate and the agents may be worse off with real-time data than without real-time data. The proposed solution to this problem is to use anticipatory techniques, where the future state of the environment is predicted from the intentions of the agents. This chapter concludes with this conjecture: if simultaneous decision making is prevented, then intention-propagation-based prediction can limit the fluctuation and help the ubiquitous IoT system converge to the Nash equilibrium. © 2018, IGI Global.

In the case of an accident involving multiple stakeholders with various (dis)incentives to honestly report, the question arises how to reconstruct the accident scene with validated and authenticated data without relying on a centralized authority. In this paper, we introduce Proof of Physics (PoP), a consensus mechanism whereby environmental (sensor) data is persisted only after audit and computational agreement that the recorded event occurred. Vehicles perform permissionless (e.g., requiring no centralized authority) writes of the signatures of their recorded events and associated content. The blocktree aggregates the verified data enabling querying over validated historic events. We evaluate the blocktree security by analyzing the ability of a malicious attacker to successfully fork the vehicle blocktree.

Current methods of monitoring phytoplankton are limited by poor specificity or by the requirement to return samples to a highly resourced, centralised lab. The Lab Card is a small, microfluidic cassette which, when used in tandem with a portable Lab Card Reader can be used to sensitively and specifically quantify harmful algae in the field, from nucleic acid extracts using RNA amplification; a sensitive and specific method for the enumeration of potentially any species based on their unique genetic signatures. This study reports the culmination of work to develop a Lab Card-based genetic assay to quantify the harmful algae Karenia brevis using mRNA amplification by the Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA) method. K. brevis cells were quantified by amplification of the rbcL gene transcript in nucleic acid extracts of K. brevis cell samples. A novel enzyme dehydration and preservation method was combined with a pre-existing reagent Gelification method to prepare fully preserved Lab Cards with a shelf-life of at least six weeks prior to use. Using an internal control (IC), the Lab Card-based rbcL NASBA was demonstrated for the quantification of K. brevis from cell extracts containing between 50 and 5000 cells.

This study designs and develops simple USV rockets for maneuvering on the water surface. First, a simple USV system is designed. Next, mechanical and electronic components are selected, and the control program is implemented using the Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller. Finally, the USV motion kinematics are analyzed, rocket thrust force is tested, and torque generated by the electric ducted fan (EDF) motor is measured. Ultimately, a rocket system with weight of 3920 g and length, width, and height of 720 mm, 500 mm, and 420 mm, respectively, is developed. The USV rocket is driven by an EDF motor with voltage and current of 1600 kV and 160 A, respectively, an electronic speed control, 6X Turnigy FHSS remote control, and two 18.5 V Li-Po 5500 mAh batteries as a power source.

These threats can be pirates in shipping operations, icebergs when sailing in the northern sea routes, or even unknown vessels or objects that might be on the ship's path. A solution to identify these threats is the use of UAV's to overfly the ship's planned path. This solution is described in this paper, using an autonomous fixed wing UAV. Based on the provided ship's planned path, the UAV should autonomously map the area close to the ship track. To do that, an optimization problem is solved using Model Predictive Control, where the turn rate for the next time period is optimized. Based on the turn rate, the future path of the UAV is calculated and the waypoints are sent to the autopilot. This application is thoroughly tested using a Software In Loop environment, where an aircraft model is used with the autopilot's simulation. The results show that surveillance performance is improved if the UAV has information about the ship's velocity in addition to position. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Each arm provides three degrees of freedom (DOF) for positioning the end-effector, and two DOF for orientation. As most model-based controllers assume that joint torque feedback is available, a torque estimator for the arms is developed. Note that low cost servos used for building low weight manipulators do not provide any torque feedback or control capability. The redundant DOFs in the dual arm prototype are exploited for generating coordinated motions during contact-less phases in such a way that reaction torques can be partially canceled. Preliminary flight tests have been conducted in outdoors, evaluating the torque compensation capability in test-bench. The influence of the reaction torques exerted by the arms over the UAV controller is also analyzed in simulation. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

A novel approach of hierarchical fuzzy logic controller (HFLC) and particle swarm optimization is proposed. Initially, teams of UAVs are moving in a pre-determined formation covering a specified area. When one or more targets are detected, the teams send a package of information to the ground station (GS) including the target's degree of threat, degree of importance, and the separating distance between each team and each detected target. First, the ground station assigns the teams to the targets based on the gathered information. HFLC is implemented in the GS to solve the assignment problem ensuring that each team is assigned to a unique target. Then, each team plans its own path by formulating the path planning problem as an optimization problem, while the objective is to minimize the time to reach their destination considering the UAVs dynamic constraints and the collision avoidance between teams. A hybrid approach of control parametrization and time discretization (CPTD) and PSO is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

One reason is presumed to be a low quality of preclinical study design, leading to bias and a low a priori power. In this study, we propose that the key read-out of experimental stroke studies, the volume of the ischemic damage as commonly measured by free-handed planimetry of TTC-stained brain sections, is subject to an unrecognized low inter-rater and test-retest reliability with strong implications for statistical power and bias. As an alternative approach, we suggest a simple, open-source, software-assisted method, taking advantage of automatic-thresholding techniques. The validity and the improvement of reliability by an automated method to tMCAO infarct volumetry are demonstrated. In addition, we show the probable consequences of increased reliability for precision, p-values, effect inflation, and power calculation, exemplified by a systematic analysis of experimental stroke studies published in the year 2015.

Applications running on a FANET eventually require the use of security mechanisms. To verify which one is the most appropriate for embedded systems like those used in such autonomous aircraft, it is necessary to carry out a study about the cryptographic methods in these platforms.

It is situated above the valley of Munster in Alsace, France. It was mainly used as a fortified place and a jail. In the early 15th century, the structure has deteriorated. Even after some repairs, it fell into ruins during the Thirty Years' war (1618-1648) and stayed uninhabited. During World War I, the German army used the place as a vantage point and also built a blockhouse inside the ruins. Nowadays, the ruins are gradually collapsing and the remains of the old walls are completely covered by thick plants. The goal of this project was to create a 3D-model of the site before closing its access, which became too dangerous for people. This modelling is divided into two elements: on one hand, a digital terrain model (DTM) of the site in order to replace the castle and to analyze the background of its original environment; on the other hand, a 3D modelling of the ruins of the castle invaded by the vegetation. Indeed, the main difficulty of the measurement is obviously the dense vegetation which hides the castle. Held back for years outside the castle, it has now become an integral part of the ruins. This vegetation is finally today usually the first threat of heritage buildings. After a preliminary inspection of the site as well as difficulties of the project, the first step consisted of the survey of the whole environment of the site. We will therefore describe the different phases of the survey with the initial implementation of a georeferenced network on site. We will present the terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) surveys, then complementary surveys carried out by aerial photogrammetry. To be implemented, we had to wait for an advanced autumn in order to have as few leaves on trees as possible. The major step of processing of point clouds described in this paper is then the extraction of a DTM by using techniques to pass through the vegetation, or better to segment the points into different classes, one of these that would be the soil i.e. DTM, another consists into wall parts of the ruins. © Authors 2017.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Due to resource constraints of the UAVs, neutralizing some threats require simultaneous effort of a certain number of UAVs in minimum. When a UAV detects multiple such targets which require team efforts, it needs to communicate with its neighbour UAVs asking for their cooperation to form colaitions to neutralize the targets. Since the involved entities are dynamic in nature, a UAV may have to terminate information exchange with its neighbours within a few iterative steps so that the decision making process can be finished before any topological change takes place. Moreover, due to sensor range and communication bandwidth limitations, a UAV cannot know about other tasks available to its neighbours in an instantaneous manner. Through communication, UAVs can learn correspondence between their own utilities and utilities of the neighbour UAVs to different joint action profiles, but not the decisions of other UAVs. We formulate the problem that a UAV faces when it detects multiple such targets and needs to decide as to which target it should try to neutralize, given the uncertainty over the decisions of its neighbour UAVs, in a game theoretic framework. We propose a correlated equilibrium concept based decentralized game theoretic solution that requires local information of the UAVs. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To provide lower complexities and security resilience against known attacks, this article proposes a two-factor (password and smart-card) user authentication protocol with the RSA cryptosystem for multiserver environments. The comprehensive security discussion proved that the known security attacks are eliminated in our protocol.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of an Appified AV platform that opens the development framework to third-party developers. To further address the safety challenges, we propose an enhanced appified AV design schema called AVGUARD, which focuses primarily on mitigating the threats brought about by untrusted code, leveraging theory in the vehicle evaluation field, and conducting program analysis techniques in the cyber security area. Our study provides guidelines and suggested practice for the future design of open AV platforms. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In particular, helicopters and other targets with rotors, as for instance miniature Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, exhibit peculiar characteristics in the radar return that can be used for their recognition. In this paper a novel algorithm to address the problem of micro-Doppler signature unmixing is proposed, exploiting the signal separation capabilities of the Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The core of the algorithm is represented precisely by the use of the ICA procedure, that has been already proved to be a very effective technique for separating hidden information in mixtures of observations. ICA has been successfully employed in several applications such as wireless communications, radar beamforming, trace-gases unmixing and medical imaging processing. The helicopter's rotor blade signature unmixing from a multi-static radar system is considered as case study and results obtained through the application of ICA to simulated multi-component micro-Doppler signatures show the capability of the proposed approach to successfully accomplish the unmixing operation. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Results show the potential of Deep Learning on herbarium species identification, particularly by training and testing across different datasets from different herbaria. This could potentially lead to the creation of a semi, or even fully automated system to help taxonomists and experts with their annotation, classification, and revision works.; BACKGROUND: Hundreds of herbarium collections have accumulated a valuable heritage and knowledge of plants over several centuries. Recent initiatives started ambitious preservation plans to digitize this information and make it available to botanists and the general public through web portals. However, thousands of sheets are still unidentified at the species level while numerous sheets should be reviewed and updated following more recent taxonomic knowledge. These annotations and revisions require an unrealistic amount of work for botanists to carry out in a reasonable time. Computer vision and machine learning approaches applied to herbarium sheets are promising but are still not well studied compared to automated species identification from leaf scans or pictures of plants in the field.; RESULTS: In this work, we propose to study and evaluate the accuracy with which herbarium images can be potentially exploited for species identification with deep learning technology. In addition, we propose to study if the combination of herbarium sheets with photos of plants in the field is relevant in terms of accuracy, and finally, we explore if herbarium images from one region that has one specific flora can be used to do transfer learning to another region with other species; for example, on a region under-represented in terms of collected data.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Fast initialization times with low-cost antennas will encourage the expansion of CDGNSS into the mass market, bringing the benefits of globally referenced centimeter-accurate positioning to many consumer applications, such as augmented reality and autonomous vehicles, that have so far been hampered by the several-meter-level errors of traditional GNSS positioning. Poor multipath suppression common to low-cost antennas results in large and strongly time-correlated phase errors when a receiver is static. Such errors can result in the CDGNSS initialization time, the so-called time to ambiguity resolution (TAR), extending to hundreds of seconds - many times longer than for higher cost survey-grade antennas, which have substantially better multipath suppression. This paper demonstrates that TAR can be significantly reduced through antenna motion, particularly gentle wavelength-scale random antenna motion. Such motion acts to decrease the correlation time of the multipath-induced phase errors. A priori knowledge of the motion profile is shown to further reduce TAR, with the reduction shown to be more pronounced as the initialization scenario is more challenging. © 1965-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In order to feed the UAV's autonomous path planning and positioning algorithm, a radio map is exploited, which must be, in practice, reconstructed from UAV-based measurements from a limited subset of locations. Unlike existing methods that ignore the segmented propagation structure of the radio map, this paper proposes a machine learning approach to reconstruct a finely structured map by exploiting both segmentation and signal strength models. A data clustering and parameter estimation problem is formulated using a maximum likelihood approach, and solved by an iterative clustering and regression algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate significant performance advantage in radio map reconstruction as compared to the baseline. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Some of the most important variables to assess the flight state are the airspeed, the angle of attack and the sideslip angle. Larger aircraft are equipped with sensors specifically designed to measure these variables. However on small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) much stricter restrictions on size, weight and cost prohibit the use of such sensors. Therefore we propose a method to estimate the airflow variables utilizing only sensors that are part of a standard UAV autopilot. This includes an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver and a pitot-static tube. These measurement together with kinematic and aerodynamic models will be fused within an estimator to estimate steady and turbulent wind velocities as well as aerodynamic coefficients. With these estimates it is possible to calculate the angle of attack, the sideslip angle and the airspeed. A main challenge is to distinguish between changes in the aerodynamic coefficients and changes in wind velocity, since pitot-static tube measurements of the relative airspeed are only available in one direction at a time and hence the system is not always observable. Therefore attitude changes have to be undertaken to achieve persistence of excitation. In this paper a Moving Horizon Estimator (MHE) is used for estimation. Simulation results show overall good estimation results and significant improvements compared to a previous Extended Kalman Filter approach. Root mean square errors (RMSE) are 0.25° for the angle of attack, 0.08m/s for the airspeed and 1.06° for the side slip estimates. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The aim of a safety indicator is to determine the correct moment for initiating a Collision Avoidance brake action to prevent a collision with the preceding truck in threatening situations. Three safety indicators are selected for an evaluation: The intended acceleration of the preceding truck, which is shared via Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) communication, the Brake Threat Number (BTN-based on simple vehicle models and an emergency brake assumption of the lead), and the Time-To-Collision (TTC-based on a constant velocity assumption). The latter two do not rely on V2V communication, but are obtained via on-board signals. Requirements for the amount of false negatives (missing a threatening situation) and the false positives (identifying a safe situation as threatening) are derived from a functional safety perspective. To find thresholds for the safety indicators that minimize the false negative rate, emergency brake tests are used. To evaluate the number of false positives, a set of data of two trucks driving in a platoon at 0.5 s at mixed-Traffic highways in Belgium and the Netherlands, collected during 8 hours of automated driving in a platoon, is used. The results indicate that the communicated intended acceleration of the preceding truck might be able to distinguish safe and threatening situations in a vehicle platoon. Furthermore, for situations without V2V, both the BTN and the TTC are not capable to distinguish between threatening and safe situations. The amount of false positives found in the safe driving data-set does not fulfill the requirements derived from functional safety perspective. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Regional scale cartography update cycle is in the medium term (10 to 15 years): therefore, in the intervening time between updates relevant Authorities must provide timely updates for new works or territorial changes. Required surveys can exploit several technologies: ground-based GPS, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), traditional topography, or, in the case of wider areas, airborne photogrammetry or laser scanning. In recent years UAV-based photogrammetry is becoming increasingly widespread as a versatile, low-cost surveying system for small to medium areas. This surveying methodology was used to generate, in order, a dense point cloud, a high resolution Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an orthophotograph of a newly built marina by the mouth of the Arno river in Pisa, Italy, which is not yet included in cartography. Surveying activities took place while the construction site was in operation. Case study issues surfaced in the course of the survey are presented and discussed, suggesting 'good practice' rules which, if followed in the survey planning step, can lessen unwanted effects due to criticalities. Besides, results of quality analysis of orthophotographs generated by UAV-borne images are also presented.

Despite having been the focus of environmental studies for decades, the benthic megafauna of the CCZ remain poorly known. To predict and manage the environmental impacts of mining in the CCZ, baseline knowledge of the megafauna is essential. The ABYSSLINE Project has conducted benthic biological baseline surveys in the UK Seabed Resources Ltd polymetallic-nodule exploration contract area (UK-1). Prior to ABYSSLINE research cruises in 2013 and 2015, no biological studies had been done in this area of the eastern CCZ. New information Using a Remotely Operated Vehicle and Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (as well as several other pieces of equipment), the megafauna within the UK Seabed Resources Ltd exploration contract area (UK-1) and at a site ~250 km east of the UK-1 area were surveyed, allowing us to make the first estimates of megafaunal morphospecies richness from the imagery collected. Here, we present an atlas of the abyssal annelid, arthropod, bryozoan, chordate, ctenophore and molluscan megafauna observed and collected during the ABYSSLINE cruises to the UK-1 polymetallic-nodule exploration contract area in the CCZ. There appear to be at least 55 distinct morphospecies (8 Annelida, 12 Arthropoda, 4 Bryozoa, 22 Chordata, 5 Ctenophora, and 4 Mollusca) identified mostly by morphology but also using molecular barcoding for a limited number of animals that were collected. This atlas will aid the synthesis of megafaunal presence/absence data collected by contractors, scientists and other stakeholders undertaking work in the CCZ, ultimately helping to decipher the biogeography of the megafauna in this threatened habitat. © Amon D et al.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This is due to the fact that their constraints and working environment are much more complex. To tackle the above challenge, an optimal nonlinear midcourse guidance logic is proposed by considering the wake terminal guidance and the remote target attack tasks. The proposed guidance logic is optimized by using an efficient genetic algorithm to obtain its optimal parameters. The results from our simulation case study suggest that the proposed guidance logic can meet both the motion requirements and navigation constraints while effectively cooperating with the wake terminal guidance. Moreover, it has potential in reducing the energy consumption to significantly improve the overall vehicle energy efficiency. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To guide the searching direction of the algorithm and reduce the occurrence of detours, the heading correction cost and minimum turning radius cost are added to the cost function.

For example, site-specific fertilizer application as part of precision agriculture (PA) management requires information within short time. But, this requires field-based measurements with hyper- or multispectral sensors, which may not be feasible on a day to day farming practice. Exploiting the information of RGB images from consumer grade cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can offer cost-efficient as well as near-real time analysis of grasslands with high temporal and spatial resolution. The potential of RGB imagery-based vegetation indices (VI) from consumer grade cameras mounted on UAVs has been explored recently in several. However, for multitemporal analyses it is desirable to calibrate the digital numbers (DN) of RGB-images to physical units. In this study, we explored the comparability of the RGBVI from a consumer grade camera mounted on a low-cost UAV to well established vegetation indices from hyperspectral field measurements for applications in grassland. The study was conducted in 2014 on the Rengen Grassland Experiment (RGE) in Germany. Image DN values were calibrated into reflectance by using the Empirical Line Method (Smith & Mlton 1999). Depending on sampling date and VI the correlation between the UAV-based RGBVI and VIs such as the NDVI resulted in varying R2 values from no correlation to up to 0.9. These results indicate, that calibrated RGB-based VIs have the potential to support or substitute hyperspectral field measurements to facilitate management decisions on grasslands. © Authors 2017.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

For this purpose, the necessary policy shift towards multi-core technology is in full swing. To eventually exploit the extra processing power, there is much additional effort needed for coping with the tremendously increased complexity. This is largely due to the elaborate parallelization process that spans a vast search space. Consequently, there is a strong need for innovative methods and appropriate tools for the migration of legacy single-core software. We use the results of a data dependency analysis performed on AUTOSAR system descriptions to determine advantageous partitions as well as initial task-to-core mappings. Afterwards, the extracted information serves as input for the simulation within a multi-core timing tool suite. Here, the initial solution is evaluated with respect to proper scheduling and metrics like cross-core communication rates, communication latencies, or core load distribution. A subsequent optimization process improves the initial solution and enables a comparative assessment. To demonstrate the benefit, we substantially expand a previous case study by applying our approach to two complex engine management systems and by showing the advantages compared to a parallelization process without preceding dependency analysis and initial partition/mapping suggestions.

These activities require both the identification of areas of interest and the deployment of suitable assets. The types of assets to be deployed depend on different aspects such as their endurance, coverage and cost. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) together with the Department of Aeronautic and Space Engineering at the Politecnico di Torino, have developed two complementary low-cost radar systems on board of an aerostat and of a drone. A Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar has been identified as the technical solution, whereas an integrated IμGPS platform has been used as navigation engine. The synchronization between units is fundamental, therefore various solutions have been investigated. The selected approach exploits the time-referenced matching between radar and navigation datasets. To evaluate the performance of the assembled system, several tests have been carried out in pre-operational conditions with the radar performing several azimuthal scans with fixed elevation angle. From the results, no drift nor bias in the attitude parameters have been observed. Moreover the adopted integration strategy allows reconstructing the polar radar picture, exploiting the synergy between the radar and the navigation units. The obtained radar pictures are consistent from scan to scan and correctly characterize the actual scenario. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To counter such challenge, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been exploited to provide a fast-deployable and high-speed communication system, where each UAV can serve as an aerial small cell base station to provide WiFi and/or cellular services for the ground users. Despite its fast-deployable and highly maneuverable features, the capacity analysis of aerial small cells is largely missing. To close such gap, a stochastic propagation model for A-to-G aerial channels is first introduced, which takes into account the impact from wave propagation, gaseous absorption, Doppler spread, attitude-dependent shadowing, and multipath fading. Then, by exploiting such model, the area spectral efficiency of the aerial small cells is investigated for both SISO and MIMO cases. Our study reveals the inherent relationship among the area capacity, height and coverage and shows that there exists an optimal attitude that can maximize network capacity and cell coverage. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, solar energy and other renewable energy sources have a drawback related to the difficulty in predicting their availability in the near future. This problem affects optimal exploitation of solar energy, especially in connection with other resources. Therefore, reliable solar energy prediction models are essential to solar energy management and economics. This paper presents work aimed at designing reliable models to predict the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) for the next day in 8 stations in Saudi Arabia. The designed models are based on computational intelligence methods of automated-design fuzzy logic systems. The fuzzy logic systems are designed and optimized with two models using fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms. The first model uses FCM based on the subtractive clustering algorithm to automatically design the predictor fuzzy rules from data. The second model is using FCM followed by simulated annealing algorithm to enhance the prediction accuracy of the fuzzy logic system. The objective of the predictor is to accurately predict next-day global horizontal irradiance (GHI) using previous-day meteorological and solar radiation observations. The proposed models use observations of 10 variables of measured meteorological and solar radiation data to build the model. The experimentation and results of the prediction are detailed where the root mean square error of the prediction was approximately 88% for the second model tuned by simulated annealing compared to 79.75% accuracy using the first model. This results demonstrate a good modeling accuracy of the second model despite that the training and testing of the proposed models were carried out using spatially and temporally independent data. © 2017 Majid Almaraashi.

This paper addresses the problem of maintaining a communication link between a command station and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with limited communication range during maritime operations. The proposed scheme uses an additional UAV that acts as a relay for the communication between the command station and the UAV in mission and is actively driven to maintain a desired Quality-of-Service (QoS) level, defined in this paper. Exploiting this architecture, it is possible to plan a maritime operation for a robotic vehicle without the need of considering vehicle-to-command-station communication constraints that will be satisfied by the introduction of the extra autonomous relay-UAVs. To this end, we propose a feedback strategy that has the dual task of commanding and optimizing the execution of the relay UAV motion tasks and adapting the scheduler algorithm according to a desired QoS level.

Under the hierarchical control framework, the position and attitude loop controls are developed in sequence based on adaptive sliding mode control schemes. Initially, using the saturation property of the hyperbolic tangent function, a position loop controller is synthesised, and a criterion for choosing control parameters is established to guarantee the singularity-free command attitude extraction. Then, in the attitude loop, to avoid singularity which occurs when the pitch reaches (Formula presented.), a novel sliding mode surface is introduced, and an attitude control project with the associated initial condition constraint is put forward. In addition, adaptive algorithms are developed to estimate and compensate the uncertainties arising from unknown inertial parameters, thrust and torque faults and undesired disturbances. It is demonstrated in terms of Lyapunov theorem that, with the proposed controller, the closed-loop position and attitude error subsystems of the VTOL UAV are asymptotically stable, respectively.

This paper studies a UAV-enabled mobile relaying system, where a high-mobility UAV is deployed to assist in the information transmission from a ground source to a ground destination with their direct link blocked. By assuming that the UAV adopts the energy-efficient circular trajectory and employs time-division duplexing (TDD) based decode-and-forward (DF) relaying, we maximize the spectrum efficiency (SE) in bits/second/Hz as well as energy efficiency (EE) in bits/Joule of the considered system by jointly optimizing the time allocations for the UAV's relaying together with its flying speed and trajectory.

However, the real-world deployment of such drone delivery systems faces many cyber-physical security challenges. In this paper, a novel mathematical framework for analyzing and enhancing the security of drone delivery systems is introduced. In this regard, a zero-sum network interdiction game is formulated between a vendor, operating a drone delivery system, and a malicious attacker. In this game, the vendor seeks to find the optimal path that its UAV should follow, to deliver a purchase from the vendor's warehouse to a customer location, to minimize the delivery time. Meanwhile, an attacker seeks to choose an optimal location to interdict the potential paths of the UAVs, so as to inflict cyber or physical damage to it, thus, maximizing its delivery time. First, the Nash equilibrium point of this game is characterized. Then, to capture the subjective behavior of both the vendor and attacker, new notions from prospect theory are incorporated into the game. These notions allow capturing the vendor's and attacker's i) subjective perception of attack success probabilities, and ii) their disparate subjective valuations of the achieved delivery times relative to a certain target delivery time. Simulation results have shown that the subjective decision making of the vendor and attacker leads to adopting risky path selection strategies which inflict delays to the delivery, thus, yielding unexpected delivery times which surpass the target delivery time set by the vendor. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Then, we exploit the characteristics of lane marks in road images as constraints to propose lane-features filter based on multi-constraints used to extract lane marks.

Applications of this control strategy include the use of high-flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with computer vision for monitoring, controlling, and coordinating the movements of lower altitude agents in areas, for example, where GPS signals may be unreliable or nonexistent. When deployed, a remote operator of the HFV defines the desired trajectory for the LFV in the HFV’s camera frame. Due to the circular motion of the HFV, the resulting motion trajectory of the LFV in the image frame can be periodic in time, thus an adaptive-repetitive control system is exploited for regulation and/or trajectory tracking. The adaptive control law is able to handle uncertainties in the camera’s intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. The design and stability analysis of the closed-loop control system is presented, where Lyapunov stability is shown. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for controlling the movement of a low-flying quadcopter, demonstrating the capabilities of the visual-servo control system for localization (i.e.,, motion capturing) and trajectory tracking control. In fact, results show that the LFV can be commanded to hover in place as well as track a user-defined flower-shaped closed trajectory, while the HFV and camera system circulates above with constant angular velocity. On average, the proposed adaptive-repetitive visual-servo control system reduces the average RMS tracking error by over 77% in the image plane and over 71% in the world frame compared to using just the adaptive visual-servo control law. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Article","Final","Scopus"

We demonstrate the capabilities of the simulation tool by a case study of convoy driving with automated vehicles using a fully distributed control algorithm and IVC. The study compares CAD-specific metrics (safety distance, headway, speed) for an ideal and a realistic communication channel. The simulation results underline the need of accurate modeling and give valuable insights for the design of CAD systems. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Tracking or trajectory data from these probe vehicles are already being used in practice for travel time or speed estimation and for monitoring network conditions. However, there has been limited work on extracting other critical traffic flow variables, in particular density and flow, from probe data. This paper presents a microscopic approach (akin to car-following) for inferring the number of unobserved vehicles in between a set of probe vehicles in the traffic stream. In particular, we develop algorithms to extract and exploit the somewhat regular patterns in the trajectories when the probe vehicles travel through stop-and-go waves in congested traffic. Using certain critical points of trajectories as the input, the number of unobserved vehicles between consecutive probes are then estimated through a Naïve Bayes model. The parameters needed for the Naïve Bayes include means and standard deviations for the probability density functions (pdfs) for the distance headways between vehicles. These parameters are estimated through supervised as well as unsupervised learning methods. The proposed ideas are tested based on the trajectory data collected from US 101 and I-80 in California for the FHWA's NGSIM (next generation simulation) project. Under the dense traffic conditions analyzed, the results show that the number of unobserved vehicles between two probes can be predicted with an accuracy of ±1 vehicle almost always. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The multimodal system consists of a thermal, a hyperspectral and an optical sensor, which can be operational with a UAV. While dealing with sensors that operate in different spectra and have different technical specifications, such as the radiometric and the geometric resolution, the challenges that are faced are presented. Addressed are the different approaches of data fusion, such as image registration, generation of 3D models by performing image matching and the means for classification based on either the geometry of the object or the pixel values.

In recent years, a few genetic markers that target V. cholerae have been reported, but their application was limited by techniques or themselves. The outer membrane lipoprotein gene lolB has been identified as a specific marker by using PCR and quantitative PCR methods. In this study, we developed a real-time recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay targeting lolB gene in an attempt to provide a sensitive, rapid, and reliable detection method of V. cholerae. The sensitivity of RPA assay was determined by amplifying the standard plasmid dilutions. The detection limit down to five copies was achieved within 10 min, which was lower than that of qPCR (ten copies after 25 cycles within 1.5 h). The reproducibility of RPA assay was verified by eight independent experiments, presenting a high R2 value of the standard regression line (0.97). In addition, the specificity was confirmed with DNA extracted from other bacteria, shrimps, clams, and fishes using both methods. Finally, V. cholerae in shrimp samples were quantified using real-time RPA and qPCR with consistent outcomes, while no amplification was obtained from clam and fish samples using both methods. The applicability in the food industry was confirmed by quantitative detection of natural seafood. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Predictions of higher mean summer temperatures and prolonged summer draughts may pose a threat to agriculture areas and forest canopies. Rising canopy temperatures can be an indicator of plant stress because of the closure of stomata and a decrease in the transpiration rate. Thermal cameras are available for decades, but still often used for single image analysis, only in oblique view manner or with visual evaluations of video sequences. Therefore remote sensing using a thermal camera can be an important data source to understand transpiration processes. Photogrammetric workflows allow to process thermal images similar to RGB data. But low spatial resolution of thermal cameras, significant optical distortion and typically low contrast require an adapted workflow. Temperature distribution in forest canopies is typically completely unknown and less distinct than for urban or industrial areas, where metal constructions and surfaces yield high contrast and sharp edge information. The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of interior camera orientation, tie point matching and ground control points on the resulting accuracy of bundle adjustment and dense cloud generation with a typically used photogrammetric workflow for UAV-based thermal imagery in natural environments. © Authors 2017.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Most known drone systems attach metadata of the recorded video in separate files or in the header of the video. Current techniques make the metadata unsecure and easy to get lost and removed as well as it occupies more storage and bandwidth. In this paper, an efficient method is proposed to hide the metadata of UAVs video using the technology of digital watermarking. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to implement the embedding of the information robustly. The middle frequencies coefficients reside on CH3 sub-band are utilized to hide the watermark bits. In addition, a new scrambling algorithm is proposed to secure the information before hiding. The adaption of the proposed video watermarking algorithm to hide the metadata of the UAV video is achieved. The experimental results prove the high performance of the proposed method. The method had unnoticeable impact on the video quality where the PSNR of 44 dB is attained.

This technology has the ability to detect Denial of Service (DoS) and black hole attacks on vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs).

Deployable aerodynamic surfaces from the wing leading or trailing edges are often used to extend the aerodynamic envelope (e.g. slats and flaps). Birds have also evolved feathers at the leading edge (LE) of their wings, known as the alula, which enables them to perform high angles of attack maneuvers. In this study, a series of wind tunnel experiments are performed to quantify the effect of various deployment parameters of an alula-like LE device on the aerodynamic performance of a cambered airfoil (S1223) at stall and post stall conditions. The alula relative angle of attack, measured from the mean chord of the airfoil, is varied to modulate tip-vortex strength, while the alula deflection angle is varied to modulate the distance between the tip vortex and the wing surface. Integrated lift force measurements were collected at various alula-inspired device configurations. The effect of the alula-inspired device on the boundary layer velocity profile and turbulence intensity were investigated through hot-wire anemometer measurements. Results show that as alula deflection angle increases, the lift coefficient also increase especially at lower alula relative angles of attack. Moreover, at post stall wing angles of attack, the wake velocity deficit is reduced in the presence of alula device, confirming the mitigation of the wing adverse pressure gradient. The results are in strong agreement with measurements taken on bird wings showing delayed flow reversal and extended range of operational angles of attack. An engineered alula-inspired device has the potential to improve mission adaptability in small unmanned air vehicles during low Reynolds number flight. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus"

A generic environmental representation methodology is proposed with three topological elements and corresponding longitudinal constraints to compose all driving scenarios mentioned in this paper according to the overlap between the potential path of the autonomous vehicle and predicted path of other road users. Planners combining A search and quadratic programming (QP) are designed to plan both rough long-Term longitudinal motions and short-Term trajectories to exploit the advantages of both search-based and optimization-based methods. Limits of vehicle kinematics and dynamics are considered in the planners to handle extreme cases.

To perform these applications, cameras and laserscanners are a good sensor combination, due to their complementary properties. To exploit this sensor combination the intrinsics and relative poses of the individual cameras and the relative poses of the cameras and the laserscanners have to be known. In this manuscript, we present a calibration methodology for the Unified Intrinsic and Extrinsic Calibration of a Multi-Camera-System and a Laserscanner (UCalMiCeL). The innovation of this methodology, which is an extension to the calibration of a single camera to a line laserscanner, is an unifying bundle adjustment step to ensure an optimal calibration of the entire sensor system. We use generic camera models, including pinhole, omnidirectional and fisheye cameras. For our approach, the laserscanner and each camera have to share a joint field of view, whereas the fields of view of the individual cameras may be disjoint. The calibration approach is tested with a sensor system consisting of two fisheye cameras and a line laserscanner with a range measuring accuracy of 30mm. We evaluate the estimated relative poses between the cameras quantitatively by using an additional calibration approach for Multi-Camera-Systems based on control points which are accurately measured by a motion capture system. In the experiments, our novel calibration method achieves a relative pose estimation with a deviation below 1.8° and 6.4mm. © Authors 2017.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

For this reason, automated authentication and identification techniques are increasingly adopted to ensure security and privacy. Furthermore, identification can be used to automatically customize operations according to the needs of the current user. A gait-based identification method that can be executed in real time on devices with limited resources is here presented. The method exploits a wearable accelerometer to continuously analyze the user’s gait pattern and perform identification. Experiments were conducted with 10 volunteers, who carried the device in a trouser pocket and followed their daily routine without predefined constraints. In total, ∼98 hours of acceleration traces were collected in uncontrolled environment, including 3073 gait segments. User identification results show a recognition rate ranging from 95% to 100%, depending on the mode of operation. It is demonstrated that the method can be executed on a standalone device with <8 KB of RAM. In addition, the energy consumption is evaluated and compared with an architecture that requires the presence of an external computing unit. Results show that the proposed solution significantly improves the lifetime of the device (approximately +70% for the considered platform), hence fostering user acceptance. © The British Computer Society 2017.

Current defense methods have serious limitations because they mostly try to physically capture an sUAS or jam its communications and its GPS signals to trigger its fail-safe features. While physical methods are usually unscalable and often slow in response, the default fail-safe features can be easily changed to other options such as continuing its pre-configured mission, regardless of jamming. Therefore, new defense solutions must be developed to address these issues. To our best knowledge, very little research has been published in this area. In this paper, we propose a false data injection attack to exploit the limitation of sensoring and processing capabilities on an sUAS and manipulate its on-board sensors, in order to deviate it from its (pre-configured) flight plan. We have analyzed the popular ArduPilot flight control system, identified potential vulnerabilities in its sensor data fusion process, and developed a method to manipulate on-board magnetometer readings while avoiding being detected by its bad-data detection schemes. Our initial results show that the proposed method is able to misguide the navigation system and deviate an sUAS from its target destination far away.

Even though wide researches have been reported, some issues are still existing for oblique images. This paper exploits the use of on-board GNSS/IMU (Global Navigation Satellite System/Inertial Measurement Unit) data to achieve efficient and reliable feature extraction and matching for oblique unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. Firstly, rough POS (Positioning and Orientation System) is calculated for each image with cooperation of on-board GNSS/IMU data and camera installation angles, which enables image rectification and footprint calculation. Secondly, two robust strategies, including the geometric rectification and tile strategy, are considered to address the issues caused by perspective deformations and to relieve the side-effects of image down-sampling. According to the results of individual performance evaluation, four combinations of these two strategies are designed and comprehensively compared in BA (Bundle Adjustment) experiments by using a real oblique UAV dataset. The results reported in this paper demonstrate that the solution with the tiling strategy is superior to the other solutions in terms of efficiency, completeness and accuracy. For feature extraction and matching of oblique UAV images, it is proposed to combine the tiling strategy with existing workflows to achieve an efficient and reliable solution. © 2017 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The scope of study is the road driver behaviour on approach towards unmanned railway level crossings and therefore, the prevention of life losses at unmanned railway level crossings. To fulfill these aims, a questionnaire was prepared and road driver survey was conducted on 458 road drivers moving across nineteen road vehicle-train collision prone unmanned railway level crossings on Shahdra-Shamli-Tapri railway route in the Northern region of India. Thereafter, the responses of the road drivers were analyzed. The results suggest that, the developed vehicle collision threat detection and avoidance system helps in masking the negative effect of all road drivers' problems that affect the road drivers approaching the unmanned railway level crossings.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The overactuation of the system is exploited by means of a hierarchical control law, which allows to prioritize several tasks during flight. We propose a safety-related primary task to avoid possible collisions. As a secondary task, we present an uncalibrated image-based visual servo strategy to drive the arm end-effector to a desired position and orientation by using a camera attached to it. In contrast to the previous visual servo approaches, a known value of camera focal length is not strictly required. To further improve flight behavior, we hierarchically add one task to reduce dynamic effects by vertically aligning the arm center of gravity to the multirotor gravitational vector, and another one that keeps the arm close to a desired configuration of high manipulability and avoiding arm joint limits. The performance of the hierarchical control law, with and without activation of each of the tasks, is shown in simulations and in real experiments confirming the viability of such prioritized control scheme for aerial manipulation. © 1996-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Mainly, these systems operate in conditions of under-actuation, which make the control a serious task especially in presence of practical constraints. The main objective within this paper is to ensure the tracking of 3D reference trajectory overcoming some of the issues related to the control of multi-rotor vehicles (such as underactuation, robustness, limited power, accuracy, overshoot, etc.). Therefore, a control scheme for Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is designed, applying the Interconnection and Damping Assignment-Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC) technique. As reference model based technique, the control specifications are readily met by fixing a desired dynamic model, which is a major advantage of the technique. Moreover, a port −controlled Hamiltonian representation is exploited in order to point out the physical properties of the system such as its internal energy. This latter is exploited, as a fitness function for an optimization algorithm, in order to decrease the consumed energy especially at the take-off step and allows the tuning of the controller parameters. The numerical simulations have shown satisfactory results that support the claims using nominal system model or disturbed model. The designed controller has been implemented on a real vehicle for which one demonstrates, in an indoor area manipulation, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The aerial vehicle chosen for validating this safe-control-scheme is the quadcopter vehicle. The user will use a bracelet composed by inertial (gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers) and electromyographic sensors that will measure the arm user movements and construe them in references for the drone.

The use of Digital Microfluidics Biochips (DMFBs) in disease assessment and recognition of target molecules had become popular during the past few years. The reliability of these DMFBs is crucial when they are used in various medical applications. Errors found in these biochips are mainly due to the defects developed during droplet manipulation, chip degradation and inaccuracies in the bio-assay experiments. The recently proposed Micro-electrode-dot Array (MEDA)-based DMFBs involve both fluidic and electronic domains in the micro-electrode cell. Thus, the testing techniques for these biochips should be revised in order to ensure proper functionality. This paper describes recent advances in the testing technologies for digital microfluidics biochips, which would serve as a useful platform for developing revised/new testing techniques for MEDA-based biochips. Therefore, the relevancy of these techniques with respect to testing of MEDA-based biochips is analyzed in order to exploit the full potential of these biochips. © 2017 by the authors.

The fundamental assumption governing our work is that every system can and will be compromised, therefore, our approach improves privacy by mitigating the effect of an attack on the system when components are hacked or otherwise compromised. This improvement is achieved by separating the patient's identity from their medical and demographic data and also splitting the clearinghouse processing of the CMS-1500 insurance claim form across six processing units, these processing units are autonomous and anonymous to one another, however, are able collaborate on a common task. We use Shannon entropy to compare the performance of this distributed application to a centralized one, Shannon entropy is a measure of the information stored in the system and the information divulged when components are compromised. This distributed approach reduces the amount of entropy eliminated in the event of an attack on the clearinghouse by approximately 79%. We also compare our approach to the MyPHRMachines architecture.

MYC, a transcription factor that is overexpressed in cancers, is involved in preventing immune cells from attacking tumor cells through inducing PD-L1 expression. This study evaluated the relationship between MYC and PD-L1 expression in 84 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who underwent curative surgical resection. Materials and Methods The relationship between MYC and PD-L1 was investigated by introducing pcDNA3-cMYC into A549 and H1299 cells with low PD-L1 expression and siRNA against MYC into H60 and H2009 cells with high PD-L1 expression. Expression of PD-L1 in NSCLC tissues was analyzed by immunostaining using a PD-L1 (22C3) PharmDx protocol using the Dako Automated Link 48 platform and expression of MYC was determined using anti-c-MYC (Y69) (ab320720). Results Of 84 patients, PD-L1 was expressed in 14 (16.7%) and MYC was overexpressed in 30 (35.7%). We investigated the relationship between PD-L1 and MYC expression. There were 49 (58.3%) double-negative patients and 9 (10.7%) double-positive patients. Significant positive correlation was observed between PD-L1 and MYC expression (γ = 0.210, P = 0.029). Double-negative patients showed better disease free (31.1 vs. 7.1 months, P = 0.011) and overall survival (56.1 vs. 14.4 months, P = 0.032) than double-positive patients. Conclusion Taken together, MYC expression significantly correlated with PD-L1 expression in NSCLC. The usefulness of MYC expression as a surrogate marker of treatment response assessment is worth evaluating for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and special interest are required for the subgroup of NSCLC patients, whose tumor expresses PD-L1 and MYC double positive. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Most of the MUAV-based applications require a time-limited access to the spectrum to complete data transmission due to limited battery capacity of the flying units. These characteristics are the origin of two main challenges faced by MUAV-based communication: 1) efficient-energy management, and 2) opportunistic spectrum access. This paper proposes an energy-efficient solution, considering the hover and communication energy, to address these issues by integrating cognitive radio (CR) technology with MUAVs. A non-convex optimization problem exploiting the mobility of MUAVs is developed for the underlay CR technique. The objective is to determine an optimized three-dimension (3D) location, for a secondary MUAV, at which it can complete its data transfer with minimum energy consumption and without harming the data rate requirement of the primary spectrum owner. Two algorithms are proposed to solve these optimization problems: a meta-heuristic particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and a deterministic algorithm based on Weber formulation. Selected numerical results show the behavior of the MUAV versus various system parameters and that the proposed solutions achieve very close results in spite of the different conceptional constructions. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

We focus on the particular problem of (automatic) UAV positioning, which is known to crucially affect performance. Existing methods typically rely on statistical models of the air-to-ground channel, and thus, they fail to exploit the fine-grained information of line-of-sight (LOS) conditions at some locations. This paper develops an efficient algorithm to find the best position of the UAV based on the fine-grained LOS information. In spite of the complex terrain topology, the algorithm is able to converge to the optimal UAV position to maximize the end-to-end throughput without a global exploration of a signal strength radio map. Numerical results demonstrate that in a dense urban area, the UAV-aided wireless system with the optimal UAV position can almost double the end-to-end capacity from the base station (BS) to the user as compared to that of a direct BS to user link. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The paper presents a method to generate smooth trajectories that prioritize the wind energy harvesting for different cases of wind fields. The algorithm for curve generation is a tridiagonal system of linear equations with slope unitary vector, tension and velocity function parameters in order to determine the spline direction at each node. The unitary direction is adjusted for each node to harvest wind energy and also the tension parameters can be determined to adjust the curvature and its rate of change, so that they can be aligned with the dynamic specification of the UAS.

In this paper, we investigate how to guarantee persistent coverage of a target area through SUAVs by exploiting characteristics of fixed terrestrial infrastructure and inherent energy limitations. This paper makes three main contributions. First, the problem of SUAV activity scheduling is formulated for pre-existing fixed placements, and centrally solved to maximize the network lifetime given a target coverage ratio. Second, a distributed, bio-inspired algorithm is devised using local (1-hop) communication only, i.e., the scheme takes into account both positioning and charging issues allowing the SUAVs to self-organize into a maximum-coverage connected swarm, and coordinate the charging operations. Third, the performance of the distributed scheme is compared to the optimal solution, and the impact of the system parameters like the placement height and the discharging rate on the coverage metrics is discussed. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, due to imperfect control and sensing, the actual state of the vehicle cannot be flawlessly predicted or measured, but estimated with uncertainty. Therefor, it is important to consider the execution risk advance in motion planning for a solution with a high success rate. The Space Exploration Guided Heuristic Search (SEHS) method is extended to deal with perception and control uncertainty in its two planning stages. First, the localization uncertainty is evaluated with a simple probabilistic robot model by the Space Exploration to find a path corridor with sufficient localization quality for the desired motion accuracy. Then, a trajectory controller is modeled with nonholonomic kinematics for the belief propagation of a robot state with primitive motions. The dynamic model and the control feedback are approximated in a close neighborhood of the reference trajectory. In this case, the Heuristic Search can propagate the state uncertainty as a normal distribution in the search tree to guarantee a high probability of safety and to achieve the required final accuracy. The belief-based SEHS is evaluated in several simulated scenarios. Compared to the basic SEHS method that assumes perfection, motions with higher execution successful rate are produced, especially the human-like behaviors for driving through narrow passages and precise parking. This confirms the major contribution of this work in exploiting the uncertainties for motion planning in autonomous driving. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

During the last decade, numerous remote user authentication schemes based on dynamic ID have been proposed for the multi-server environment using smart cards. Recently, Shunmuganathan et al. pointed out that Li et al.’s scheme is defenseless in resisting the password guessing attack, stolen smart card attack and forgery attack. Furthermore, they showed the poor repairability and no two-factor security in Li et al.’s scheme. To surmount these security disadvantages, Shunmuganathan et al. proposed a remote user authentication scheme using smart card for multi-server environment and claimed that their scheme is secure and efficient. In this paper, we show that Shunmuganathan et al.’s scheme is also defenseless in resisting the password guessing attack, stolen smart card attack, user impersonation attack, forgery attack, forward secrecy and session key secrecy. Moreover, the two-factor security is also not preserved in their scheme. In our proposed scheme, a user is free to choose his/her login credentials such as user id and password. And also a user can regenerate the password any time. Simultaneously the proposed scheme preserves the merits of Shunmuganathan et al.’s scheme and also provides better functionality and security features, such as mutual authentication, session key agreement and perfect forward secrecy. The security analysis using the widely accepted Burrows–Abadi–Needham logic shows that the proposed scheme provides the mutual authentication proof between a user and a server.

This study exploits the low altitude, high-resolution remote sensing capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms to examine the major environmental variables that affect water reflectance acquisition, without the confounding influence of atmospheric effects typical of higher-altitude platforms. After observation and analysis, we found: (1) multiple water spectra measured at the same location had a standard deviation of 10.4%; (2) water spectra changes associated with increasing altitude from 20 m to 100 m were negligible; (3) the difference between mean reflectance at three off-shore locations in an urban water body reached 29.9%; (4) water bottom visibility increased water reflectance by 20.1% in near shore areas compared to deep water spectra in a clear water lake; (5) emergent plants caused the water spectra to shift towards a shape that is characteristic of vegetation, whereas submerged vegetation showed limited effect on water spectra in the studied lake; (6) cloud and sun glint had major effects and caused water spectra to change abruptly; while glint and shadow effects on spectra may balance each other under certain conditions, the water reflectance can also be unpredictable at times due to wave effects and their effects on lines-of-site to calm water; (7) water spectra collected under a variety of different conditions (e.g. multiple locations, waves) resulted in weaker regression models compared to spectra collected under ideal conditions (e.g. single location, no wave), although the resulting model coefficients were relatively stable. The methods and results from this study contribute to better understanding of water reflectance acquisition using remote sensing, and can be applied in UAV-based water quality assessment or to aid in validation of higher altitude imagery. © 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The developed spatial partition-based particle filtering framework breaks the system state and observation data into smaller spatial regions and then carries out localized particle filtering based on these spatial regions. Particle Filters (PFs) hold great promise to support data assimilation for spatial temporal simulations, such as wildfire spread simulation, to achieve more accurate simulation or prediction results. However, PFs face major challenges to work effectively for complex spatial temporal simulations due to the high-dimensional state space of the simulation models, which typically cover large areas and have a large number of spatially dependent state variables. The developed framework exploits the spatial locality property of system state and observation data and employs the divide-and-conquer principle to reduce state dimension and data complexity. This framework is especially developed for a discrete event cellular space model (the wildfire simulation model), which significantly differs from prior works that use numerical models specified by partial differential equations (PDEs) with continuous variables. Within this framework, a two-level automated spatial partitioning method is presented to provide automated and balanced spatial partitions with fewer boundary sensors. The developed framework is applied to a wildfire spread simulation and achieved improved results compared to using standard PF-based data assimilation methods. © 2017 ACM.","Article","Final","Scopus"

We tackle this challenging and rarely addressed problem with a vision system that leverages appearance, contextual as well as geometric cues. To utilize the appearance and contextual cues, we propose a new deep learning-based obstacle detection framework. Here a variant of a fully convolutional network is proposed to predict a pixel-wise semantic labeling of (i) free-space, (ii) on-road unexpected obstacles, and (iii) background. The geometric cues are exploited using a state-of-The-Art detection approach that predicts obstacles from stereo input images via model-based statistical hypothesis tests.

The urgency for this new direction is underscored by the fact that the physical transportation network at most countries constitutes the most valuable publicly owned infrastructure and efforts must be made to keep it resilient to possible threats of man-made or natural disasters over its service life so that the movement of people and goods can continue uninterrupted to serve the economy and maintain the quality of life. The concept of transportation asset management (TAM) is a systematic process based on multiple disciplines (engineering, finance, operations research and economics), to make cost-effective repair and replacement decisions geared towards a sustained state of good repair over the infrastructure life cycle. This paper first argues for the continued application of asset management principles for transportation infrastructure in the new millennium. The paper then discusses the development cycle of transportation infrastructure as a prelude to a discussion of the key functions of an asset management system. The paper proceeds to identify the components (asset types) and elements of asset management (that is, the tasks that are carried out by an asset manager in an agency). The challenges and opportunities of asset management in the new millennium are then discussed. These include, among others, the specter of climate change, infrastructure resilience, sustainable development of transportations assets, the emerging era of autonomous vehicles and smart cities, and the consideration of transportation assets as a holistic system-of-systems.

Indeed, so far, no existing solution is able to effectively deal with the peculiarities of real-world videos, especially in cases of articulated motion and object occlusions; limitations that appear more evident when we compare the performance of automated methods with the human one. However, manually segmenting objects in videos is largely impractical as it requires a lot of time and concentration. To address this problem, in this paper we propose an interactive video object segmentation method, which exploits, on one hand, the capability of humans to identify correctly objects in visual scenes, and on the other hand, the collective human brainpower to solve challenging and large-scale tasks. In particular, our method relies on a game with a purpose to collect human inputs on object locations, followed by an accurate segmentation phase achieved by optimizing an energy function encoding spatial and temporal constraints between object regions as well as human-provided location priors. Performance analysis carried out on complex video benchmarks, and exploiting data provided by over 60 users, demonstrated that our method shows a better trade-off between annotation times and segmentation accuracy than interactive video annotation and automated video object segmentation approaches. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Water bodies like dams, lakes, ponds play major role in storing and distributing the water in efficient manner. Stored water is used for drinking purpose, agriculture irrigation, electricity generation, etc. Sometimes excess storage of water causes flood during heavy raining season and kills valuable resources including human life. This mandates that the water bodies should be frequently monitored and controlled for the benefits of mankind. Water body monitoring involves the quantity and quality of water stored, input and output water flow through inlet and outlet shutters respectively, condition of the inlet and outlet shutters, condition of the channels carry the water to oceans during flood, etc. Conventional manual monitoring of water bodies consists several disadvantages including high manual overhead, low accuracy and excess time in measurements, high communication delay, high cost, life threatening risks during measurements, etc. The objective of the proposed work is to automatically monitor and control the smart water bodies to sort out the disadvantages of conventional monitoring. The proposed system consists of Remote Monitoring and Control Station (RMCS), Field Control Unit (FCU), Patrol Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (PUAV), different floating sensors like rainfall sensor, water quality sensor, inlet and outlet shutter interfaces, alarms. The proposed system is able to monitor the water body frequently and prepares accurate report that includes quantity of water, rainfall rate, input and output water flow rate, quality of water like existence of any poisonous chemical contents, working condition of the inlet/outlet shutters, etc. This report is quickly sent to the RMCS for further actions. The RMCS can pull the complete report or any particular information on demand. Further the RMCS processes the report to extract the knowledge for further actions like opening/closing shutters, replacing damaged sensors, directing PUAVs to capture the pictures, sending messages to field officials and operators, etc. As a whole, the proposed system significantly reduces the manual overhead, cost, time required to measure/check various factors while increasing the accuracy of measurements and enables the remote monitoring unit to monitor and govern the water body in all aspects. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this study, we designed, developed, and tested a selfcontained, free-swimming robotic device, the KnifeBot, to emulate the locomotor behaviors of knifefish, a typical fish that excels in using this type of propulsion. This novel biomimetic underwater vehicle uses an elongated ribbon-like fin composed of 16 fin rays interconnected by a compliant membrane as the propulsor. It features a slender 3D printed hull, 16 DC motors for actuating the fin rays, 2 Li-Ion batteries for providing power, wireless radio communication, and various sensors to measure acceleration, orientation, inside temperature, pressure and to detect leakage. We used this robotic device in two experimental sets: (1) the robot without pectoral fins to perform forward swimming, reversed swimming, and hovering maneuvers and (2) the robot with a pair of pectoral fins with fixed angle of attack (−5°) to perform forward swimming. In this paper, we focus on the design, implementation, and control of the robot. We also present the results of forward swimming velocity, power consumption, and Euler orientation angles of the robot with and without pectoral fins. Our results show that the cost of transport follows a V-shape trend with the lowest point at low swimming speed, indicating the undulating fin propulsion is more efficient at low speeds. For the cases studied, the Strouhal number, St, ranges from 0.5 to 0.2 with the best cost-of-transport corresponding to St = 0.2. We found that the airfoil-like pectoral fins at small negative angles of attack slightly slow down the speed of the robotic vessel and reduce its pitch angle. The robot can take advantage of the pectoral fins to control its maneuver from swimming at the water surface to rapid diving. Our findings demonstrate that undulating fin-based propulsion has the potential to enhance the mobility and performance of underwater vehicles navigating in complex environments. © 2017, Marine Technology Society Inc..

The direct end-to-end mapping from raw input data to cost bypasses the effort of manually designing parts of the pipeline, exploits a large number of data samples, and can be framed additionally to refine handcrafted cost maps produced based on manual hand-engineered features. To achieve this, we introduce a maximum-entropy-based, non-linear inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework which exploits the capacity of fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) to represent the cost model underlying driving behaviours. The application of a high-capacity, deep, parametric approach successfully scales to more complex environments and driving behaviours, while at deployment being run-time independent of training dataset size. After benchmarking against state-of-the-art IRL approaches, we focus on demonstrating scalability and performance on an ambitious dataset collected over the course of 1 year including more than 25,000 demonstration trajectories extracted from over 120 km of urban driving. We evaluate the resulting cost representations by showing the advantages over a carefully, manually designed cost map and furthermore demonstrate its robustness towards systematic errors by learning accurate representations even in the presence of calibration perturbations. Importantly, we demonstrate that a manually designed cost map can be refined to more accurately handle corner cases that are scarcely seen in the environment, such as stairs, slopes and underpasses, by further incorporating human priors into the training framework. © The Author(s) 2017.","Article","Final","Scopus"

These rays have pectoral fins with a triangular planform and streamlined cross-sectional geometry that would minimize drag. Thrust is produced by vertical oscillations of the fins with spanwise and chordwise flexibility. The thrust is derived from lift generated by the fins. Speed is modulated by changes in oscillatory frequency, whereas the amplitude of heave remains relatively constant with speed. Mobuliform swimming is considered to be a highly efficient means of propulsion. The Strouhal number for different species of myliobatoid rays is within the optimal range for efficient propulsion, except at low swimming speeds. The design of the body, posture of the pectoral fins, and mode of swimming provide a stable platform to resist external and internal perturbations, while permitting maneuverability.

Automatic collision detection and avoidance for tele-operated UAVs can reduce the workload of pilots to allow them to focus on the task at hand, such as searching for victims in a search and rescue scenario following a natural disaster. The proposed algorithm takes the pilot’s input and exploits the robot’s dynamics to predict the robot’s trajectory for determining whether a collision will occur. Using on-board sensors for obstacle detection, if a collision is imminent, the algorithm modifies the pilot’s input to avoid the collision while attempting to maintain the pilot’s intent. The algorithm is implemented using a low-cost on-board computer, flight-control system, and a two-dimensional laser illuminated detection and ranging sensor for obstacle detection along the trajectory of the robot. The sensor data is processed using a split-and-merge segmentation algorithm and an approximate Minkowski difference.

"Exploring the roots of unintended safety threats associated with the introduction of hospital ePrescribing systems and candidate avoidance and/or mitigation strategies: A qualitative study","2017","BMJ Quality and Safety","10.1136/bmjqs-2016-005879","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019157774&doi=10.1136%2fbmjqs-2016-005879&partnerID=40&md5=6fd4a20adb7d13d2b16f319b87d102da","Objective Hospital electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) systems offer a wide range of patient safety benefits. Like other hospital health information technology interventions, however, they may also introduce new areas of risk. Despite recent advances in identifying these risks, the development and use of ePrescribing systems is still leading to numerous unintended consequences, which may undermine improvement and threaten patient safety. These negative consequences need to be analysed in the design, implementation and use of these systems. We therefore aimed to understand the roots of these reported threats and identify candidate avoidance/mitigation strategies. Methods We analysed a longitudinal, qualitative study of the implementation and adoption of ePrescribing systems in six English hospitals, each being conceptualised as a case study. Data included semistructured interviews, observations of implementation meetings and system use, and a collection of relevant documents. We analysed data first within and then across the case studies. Results Our dataset included 214 interviews, 24 observations and 18 documents. We developed a taxonomy of factors underlying unintended safety threats in: (1) suboptimal system design, including lack of support for complex medication administration regimens, lack of effective integration between different systems, and lack of effective automated decision support tools; (2) inappropriate use of systems - in particular, too much reliance on the system and introduction of workarounds; and (3) suboptimal implementation strategies resulting from partial roll-outs/dual systems and lack of appropriate training. We have identified a number of system and organisational strategies that could potentially avoid or reduce these risks. Conclusions Imperfections in the design, implementation and use of ePrescribing systems can give rise to unintended consequences, including safety threats. Hospitals and suppliers need to implement short- and long-term strategies in terms of the technology and organisation to minimise the unintended safety risks. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Due to the emergence of resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (multidrug resistant salmonellae) in the late 1980s, fluoroquinolones and extended spectrum cephalosporins became the drugs of choice. Resistance to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone due to the production of Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) and reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin have emerged resulting in treatment failure. The Cefotaximase (CTX-M) type ESBLs are the most widespread beta lactamase among Enterobacteriaceae including salmonellae. Aim: To detect the presence of blaCTX-M in salmonellae causing human infections. Detection of qnr genes to identify the coexistence of blaCTX-M and qnr gene. Materials and Methods: The study included 103 consecutive, non-repetitive salmonellae isolated from clinical specimens obtained from July 2015- June 2016 which were identified up to species level by conventional/automated methods .Susceptibility to various classes of antimicrobial agents was determined by disc diffusion method. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone was determined by agar dilution method. The results were interpreted in accordance with Clinical & Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) (guidelines 2015. Detection of the ESBL phenotype was performed by the combined disk method. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of all isolates was performed using group specific primers to characterize the presence of blaCTX-M, qnrA ,qnrB and qnrS. Result: Of the 103 study isolates two isolates of Salmonella typhi were resistant to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone and had a MIC of 128µg/ml. PCR amplification and sequencing detected the presence of blaCTX-M-15 in these two isolates. These two isolates exhibited resistance to ciprofloxacin in vitro but qnr gene was not detected in these isolates. Conclusion: Resistance to third generation cephalosporins among salmonellae is a cause for concern as it may lead to treatment failure. It is imperative to continuously monitor the susceptibility pattern as enteric fever is endemic in India. © 2017, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

In many scenarios both tasks are concurrently required, but are disparate in their area investigation techniques; surveillance requires global exploration, whereas tracking takes a local target-centric view. Thus, the two tend to require different actions when controlling UAVs tasked with their respective objectives. We propose formulating the UAV control problem for concurrent surveillance and target tracking as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) applying a Q-value approximation technique called nominal belief-state optimization (NBO). Using the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter as the tracking algorithm, we are able to exploit the birth-intensity components combined with non-myopic action selection inspiring the desired accompanying surveillance behaviors. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

On the occasion that there emerges some form of complementarity between the tasks in the unified space, multitask optimization can bring about favourable leaps in the genetic lineage through automated gene transfer, thereby leading to notably accelerated convergence characteristics. In this paper, we further emphasize the efficacy of multitasking across problems through an algorithmic realization based on a coevolutionary framework. It is contended that the mechanics of cooperative coevolution are particularly well suited for exploiting the commonalities and/or complementarities between different (yet possibly related) optimization tasks in a single multitasking environment. To this end, we label the resultant approach as coevolutionary multitasking for concurrent global optimization. Further, in order to effectively navigate continuous search spaces of varying degrees of complexity, we employ the particle swarm algorithm as a sample instantiation of a base optimizer for a real-parameter unification scheme. Based on a series of numerical experiments carried out for synthetic functions as well as real-world optimization settings in engineering design, we demonstrate the efficacy of multitask optimization as a paradigm promising enhanced productivity in future decision making processes. © 2017","Article","Final","Scopus"

With lane-specific measurements and lane-specific control, more measures are possible. Single frequency precise point positioning (PPP) is a newly developed and affordable technique to achieve an improved position accuracy compared with global positioning system (GPS) standalone positioning. GPS-PPP allows for sub-meter accurate positioning, in real time, of vehicles on a motorway. This paper tests this technique in real life; moreover, it presents a methodology to map the lanes on a motorway using data collected by this technique. The methodology exploits the high accuracy and the fact that the most driving is within a lane. In a field test, a GPS-PPP equipped vehicle drives a specific motorway stretch 100 times, for which the GPS-PPP trajectory data are collected. Using these data, the positions and the widths of different lanes are successfully estimated. Comparison with the ground truth shows a dm accuracy. With the parametrized lanes, vehicles can be tracked down to a lane with the GPS-PPP device. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

During operations Modular and Hooper the South African Defence Force (SADF)-UNITA allies succeeded in effectively stopping the advance of the Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola (MPLA) allies. The primary objective to destroy all FAPLA brigades east of the Cuito River or to drive them across the river at least, could not fully be realised, however. During Operation Hooper, two failed attacks were launched on Tumpo within the scope of about two weeks-each time from the same direction or line of advance. This article focuses on the third and fnal South African Defence Force (SADF)-UNITA attack on Tumpo and the claim by Colonel Jan Breytenbach, former commander of 32 Battalion, that ""By early the next morning [23 March 1988] they had driven the 25th Brigade from their positions and taken Tumpu [sic]. This clearly demonstrated that well planned, well led and well coordinated night [sic] attacks by well trained infantary seldom fail."" The task of launching a third attempt to conquer Tumpo would be undertaken by elements of citizen force units, 32 Battalion and four UNITA infantry battalions under the command of 82 South African Mechanised Brigade (SA Mech Bde). The citizen force units in question were Regiment Mooi River, Regiment President Steyn, Regiment De la Rey, Regiment Great Karoo, Regiment Potchefstroom University, 44 Parachute Brigade, 13 Field Engineering Regiment, 19 Rocket Regiment and 7 Anti-Aircraft Regiment. The maximum number of UNITA infantry had to join the attack, mainly to draw fre, to identify targets and to restrict SADF losses to the minimum. To justify the continued battle, the SADF provided fve reasons to leadership and troops: The MPLA was illegally in power in Angola; Angola was used as a frm base by the Union of Socialist Sowjet Republics (USSR) to fght against the Republic of South Africa (RSA) and South West Africa (SWA); the USSR supported the MPLA and the ANC; and UNITA served as a buffer zone for attacks against SWA and therefore the SADF was indirectly fghting for UNITA and directly for the RSA. It would also give the SADF an opportunity to test new weaponry. Several dominant factors, however, led to the failure of the third attack on Tumpo: A lack of creative thinking, by repeating almost exactly the same plan of attack and line of advance of the failed second attack on Tumpo; the lack of an informed logistics system (e.g. shortage of diesel and mechanical readiness of vehicles and equipment); well-entrenched and well-equipped MPLA forces; inadequate intelligence (especially regarding the second minefeld); almost impassable sandy and forested terrain; unmanned observer posts; largely insuffcient preparation and training of citizen force units; the tension and lack of trust between citizen force units and SADF permanent force offcers; and international pressure to withdraw from Angola. The morale of the SADF-UNITA troops reached a low after the third failed attempt. The MPLA morale, in contrast, was particularly high, after successfully defending Tumpo and seizing three SADF tanks. The tanks which were abandoned by the SADF, had strong propaganda value for the MPLA forces. One of the tanks was towed to 25 Battalion's positions while the others were protected by positions to prevent the SADF forces from reaching them. Foreign journalists were even flown in to view the SADF tanks. In addition, amplifed broadcasting was used to announce far and wide that the three tanks were in FAPLA hands and that an Afrikaans-speaking SADF soldier was captured. As in previous operations, the SADF did not realise the importance of psychological debriefng. Many traumatised SADF soldiers suffered from post-traumatic stress, which put a damper on their vitality. UNITA suffered serious personnel losses, especially the troops who had moved with the tanks. In addition, many soldiers of the two UNITA battalions who attacked on the western bank, died in action. In contrast, the SADF forces suffered no losses. The objective to minimise SADF losses through the maximum utilisation of UNITA troops, was therefore fully realised.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Motivated by the ubiquitous WiFi signals around us, we propose WiDrone, a WiFi fingerprint location cross-check based anti-hijacking system on commodity drones in this poster. WiDrone still relies on GPS for navigation but it will authenticate the destination by comparing current WiFi fingerprint (CWF) with the destination WiFi fingerprint (DWF) when the drone receives a landing order. Furthermore, we propose a WiFi fingerprint authentication algorithm to decide whether CWF matches DWF.

With the emergence of Fog Computing, computations may be offloaded to robotic peers, smart gateway devices and remote Cloud virtual machines. In order to effectively make use of such resources, a-priori estimation of execution times of offloaded computational programs is necessary. In this paper, we make use of profiling tools to accurately measure execution times of runtime computations on development testbeds. By exploiting performance benchmarks, we estimate the processing times on heterogeneous robot/Fog/Cloud deployment hardware as well as with varying data sizes. This allows us to determine optimal computational offloading strategies with differing computational complexities, data sizes, parallel processing and heterogeneous devices.

The existence of age dependence would impact the development and operation of automated quantitative capnographic tools. Here, we quantitatively assess the relationship between normal capnogram shape and age. Capnograms were collected from healthy subjects, and physiologically-based features (exhalation duration, end-tidal CO2 and time spent at this value, normalized time spent at end-tidal CO2, end-exhalation slope, and instantaneous respiratory rate) were computationally extracted. The mean values of the individual features over 30 exhalations were linearly regressed against subject age, accounting for inter-feature correlation. After data collection, 154 of 178 subjects were eligible for analysis, with an age range of 3-78 years (mean age 39, std. dev. 20 years). The Bonferroni-corrected joint 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the regression line slopes contained the origin for five of six features (the remaining CI was only slightly offset from the origin). The associated individual r2 values for the regressions were all below 0.07.

This often requires proper identification of vulnerable execution paths that contain program vulnerabilities or bugs. However, with rapid rise in software complexity, it has become notoriously difficult to identify such vulnerable paths through exhaustively searching the entire program execution space. In this paper, we propose StatSym, a novel, automated Statistics-Guided Symbolic Execution framework that integrates the swiftness of statistical inference and the rigorousness of symbolic execution techniques to achieve precision, agility and scalability in vulnerable program path discovery. Our solution first leverages statistical analysis of program runtime information to construct predicates that are indicative of potential vulnerability in programs. These statistically identified paths, along with the associated predicates, effectively drive a symbolic execution engine to verify the presence of vulnerable paths and reduce their time to solution. We evaluate StatSym on four real-world applications including polymorph, CTree, Grep and thttpd that come from diverse domains. Results show that StatSym is able to assist the symbolic executor, KLEE, in identifying the vulnerable paths for all of the four cases, whereas pure symbolic execution fails in three out of four applications due to memory space overrun. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Field development of heavy oil reservoirs requires careful determination of optimal parameters, well locations and control setting of producers and injectors. In recent years, field development decisions based on sensitivity studies have been shifting toward automated optimization. In this paper, we present the optimal parameter selection for SAGD and VAPEX. We performed the search of optimum parameters; the vertical separation between injector and producer, well controls and well locations. All these parameters have been simultaneously optimized to study and compare the performance of both processes. Also, we present an efficient method to constrain horizontal wells to preset minimum well spacing constraints. This method was then applied to constrain the well spacing between different peers of horizontal wells in the SAGD and VAPEX processes. The particle swarm optimization was used as an optimizer to determine the optimum parameters. The results indicated that the method could successfully determine the optimal parameters while satisfying the spacing constraint imposed by the user. The comparison of the results showed the better performance of SAGD over VAPEX process. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"
"Innovative redundant and reconfigurable propulsion systems: Fast prototyping through simplified simulation and design procedures","2017","Marine Engineering: Emerging Developments and Global Challenges","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044422341&partnerID=40&md5=0b2e0a6706e92b675757e0a4b48507ee","Traditionally the application of Autonomous and Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicles have been confined to high end applications with a market limited to a small number of users represented by big research, industrial and military groups. Emerging civil applications are mainly involved on extended monitoring and surveillance of marine environment with particular attention to biological, geological and cultural aspects. Also from an industrial point of view, Energy and Telecommunication industries are mainly interested in possible applications concerning construction, maintenance and surveillance of underwater industrial facilities. The wide field of application of this kind of vehicles involves the development of many different vehicles with limited production series that have to be deeply customized according to the expected mission profiles ranging from a simple extended navigation to complex manipulation tasks. The adopted propulsion layout plays a key role in determining the navigation performances of vehicles in terms of autonomy, manoeuvrability, number of controlled degrees of freedom and precision of the motion. For their current and past research activities authors have been working on the design of several AUVs and ROVs adopted in many national and international projects, such as Thesaurus, Arrows and Suono, gaining a good experience in the design of underwater propulsion and actuation layouts. In this work authors try to introduce some examples of propulsion layouts related to their previous experience introducing simplified criteria for a global design of the propulsion layout. This is achieved by melting mechatronics, fluid dynamics and more generally miscellaneous engineering topics that are often deeply studied by different working teams with different competences. Such an approach is quite consolidated for big projects but quite unpractical for highly customized products such as AUVs and ROV which are developed for specific tasks. In particular, in this work after a general introduction to modelling, design and simulation criteria, two benchmark test cases regarding a conventional propulsion array adopted by authors on Tifone and Marta AUVs are compared with an innovative solution based on a redundant and reconfigurable array of podded thrusters. The aim of this comparison is to demonstrate how the adoption of innovative simulation tools and methodologies such as object oriented simulation software should be used to explore complex and innovative solutions that are quite difficult to be examined with conventional tools. In particular, it has been explored the possibility of modelling the advantages in terms of vehicle manoeuvrability arising from a dynamical and continuous reconfiguration of a system with podded and pivoted thrusters. In particular, for this kind of configurations it's fundamental a dynamical simulation in which the proposed solution is coupled with a near to realistic control system in order to verify all the complex control and mechatronics aspects involved in this kind of system. Another interesting aspect that is proposed in this study is the possibility to study the behaviour of the system in case of partial failure of one or more actuators. This is done by defining through simulation the corresponding recovery control strategies that should be used to assure residual manoeuvring and navigation capabilities needed to ""take back"" the vehicle assuring the survival of an expensive tool and avoid potential catastrophic effects in term of mission results. From this point of view, for the innovative proposed solution, reliability is not assured only by system redundancy but also by the introduction of some simple design solution such magneto-static transmission systems that can be useful to increase system reliability in case of unpredicted or potentially dangerous events. Finally, a non-secondary part of the work is dedicated to the way in which proposed models should be satisfying calibrated with a very limited set of tests and tech information concerning the dynamical rsponse of the actuator that can be easily performed with reasonable costs exploiting the advantage of modern 3D printing techniques and the recent availability of low cost sensors and mechatronics components from the increasing market of ludo-robotics applications. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In the horizontal plane and the vertical plane, the flow disturbance acting on the HAG-UUV was analyzed. Considering the coupling of the HAG-UUV and the wing, numerical simulations were completed using Ansys CFX. The conditions of different distances between the center of buoyancy of the HAG-UUV and the aircraft wing from 540 mm to 940 mm, different attack angles from -5° to 20° and different sideslip angles from -15° to 15° were investigated. Then, the curves of the fluid forces and torques were drawn. Results have shown that when the distance between the center of buoyancy and the wing is smaller than 760 mm, wall effect is significant, and the fluid forces acting on the HAG-UUV in the vertical direction rapidly increases. The attack angle greatly enhances the hydrodynamics of the HAG-UUV. When the sideslip angle changes from -15° to 15°, the hydrodynamics acting on the HAG-UUV are not asymmetrical about 0° sideslip angle. When the sideslip angle is 0°, the HAG-UUV is still disturbed by the lateral force and yaw moment. The reason for this phenomenon lies in the sweepback wing, resulting in lateral induced velocity of the flow field. © 2017, Editorial Board of Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Agricultural intensification has resulted in fragmented patches of remnant grassland habitat both across Europe and internationally. The monitoring of remnant patches of this habitat is critically important, however, traditional surveying of large, remote landscapes is a notoriously costly and difficult task. The emergence of small-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) equipped with low-cost multi-spectral cameras offer an alternative to traditional grassland survey methods, and have the potential to progress and innovate the monitoring and future conservation of this habitat globally. The aim of this article is to investigate the potential of sUAS for rapid detection of threatened unimproved grassland and to test the use of an Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI). A sUAS aerial survey is undertaken at a site nationally recognised as an important location for fragmented unimproved mesotrophic grassland, within the south east of England, UK. A multispectral camera is used to capture imagery in the visible and near-infrared spectrums, and the ENDVI calculated and its discrimination performance compared to a range of more traditional vegetation indices. In order to validate the results of analysis, ground quadrat surveys were carried out to determine the grassland communities present. Quadrat surveys identified three community types within the site; unimproved grassland, improved grassland and rush pasture. All six vegetation indices tested were able to distinguish between the broad habitat types of grassland and rush pasture; whilst only three could differentiate vegetation at a community level. The Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI) was the most effective index when differentiating grasslands at the community level. The mechanisms behind the improved performance of the ENDVI are discussed and recommendations are made for areas of future research and study. © 2017 Strong et al.

The machine vision challenge is to generate accurate urban maps from existing data with minimal manual annotation. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that takes GPS registered LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) point clouds and street view images as inputs and creates semantic labels for the 3D points clouds using a hybrid of rule-based parsing and learning-based labelling that combine point cloud and photometric features. The rule-based parsing boosts segmentation of simple and large structures such as street surfaces and building facades that span almost 75% of the point cloud data. For more complex structures, such as cars, trees and pedestrians, we adopt boosted decision trees that exploit both structure (LiDAR) and photometric (street view) features. We provide qualitative examples of our methodology in 3D visualization where we construct parametric graphical models from labelled data and in 2D image segmentation where 3D labels are back projected to the street view images.

In contrast to monocular SLAM, scale definition and 3-D information are issues that can be more easily dealt with in stereo cameras. Air-SSLAM starts from computing keypoints and the correspondent descriptors over the pair of images, using good features-to-track and rotated-binary robust-independent elementary features, respectively. Then a map is created by matching each pair of right and left frames. The long-term map maintenance is continuously performed by analyzing the quality of each matching, as well as by inserting new keypoints into uncharted areas of the environment. Three main contributions can be highlighted in our method: 1) a novel method to match keypoints efficiently; 2) three quality indicators with the aim of speeding up the mapping process; and 3) map maintenance with uniform distribution performed by image zones.

Methods Susceptibility test was carried out using Kirby-Bauer method or automated systems. Results A total of 4 229 clinical isolates were isolated from January to December 2015, including 2 688 (63.6%) gram negative and 1 541 (36.4%) gram positive bacteria. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) accounted for 47.2% and 76.4%, respectively. The methicillin-resistant strains have much higher resistance rates to beta-lactams and other antimicrobial agents than methicillin-susceptible strains. Majority (94.0%) of MRSA strains were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 83.1% MRCNS strains were susceptible to rifampin. No staphylococcal isolates were found resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin or linezolid. E. faecalis strains showed much lower resistance rate to most of the drugs tested (except chloramphenicol) than E. faecium. No enterococcal isolates were found resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. ESBLs were produced in 52.6% of E. coli and 39.7% of Klebsiella (K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca) strains. ESBLs-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains had higher resistance rates to common antimicrobial agents than non-ESBLs-producing strain. Enterobacteriaceae isolates were highly susceptible to carbapenems, (<4% resistant). Acinetobacter spp. strains showed high resistance to imipenem (69.2% resistant) and meropenem (71.2% resistant).

An arrhythmia is an abnormal heartbeat rhythm which can be life-threatening. Atrial fibrillation (Afib), atrial flutter (Afl), and ventricular fibrillation (Vfib) are the recurring life-threatening arrhythmias that affect the elderly population. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is the principal diagnostic tool employed to record and interpret ECG signals. These signals contain information about the different types of arrhythmias. However, due to the complexity and non-linearity of ECG signals, it is difficult to manually analyze these signals. Moreover, the interpretation of ECG signals is subjective and might vary between the experts. Hence, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system is proposed. The CAD system will ensure that the assessment of ECG signals is objective and accurate. In this work, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) technique to automatically detect the different ECG segments. Our algorithm consists of an eleven-layer deep CNN with the output layer of four neurons, each representing the normal (Nsr), Afib, Afl, and Vfib ECG class. In this work, we have used ECG signals of two seconds and five seconds’ durations without QRS detection. We achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 92.50%, 98.09%, and 93.13% respectively for two seconds of ECG segments. We obtained an accuracy of 94.90%, the sensitivity of 99.13%, and specificity of 81.44% for five seconds of ECG duration. This proposed algorithm can serve as an adjunct tool to assist clinicians in confirming their diagnosis. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The association between transfusion performed using a liberal hemoglobin (Hb) trigger—defined as an intraoperative Hb level of ≥10 g/dL, a postoperative level of ≥8 g/dL, or a whole hospital nadir between 8 and 10 g/dL—and perioperative morbidity and cost in spine surgery patients is unknown and thus was investigated in this study. Purpose This study aimed to describe the perioperative outcomes and economic cost associated with liberal Hb trigger transfusion among spine surgery patients. Study Design/Setting This is a retrospective study. Patient Sample The surgical billing database at our institution was queried for inpatients discharged between 2008 and 2015 after the following procedures: atlantoaxial fusion, anterior cervical fusion, posterior cervical fusion, anterior lumbar fusion, posterior lumbar fusion, lateral lumbar fusion, other procedures, and tumor-related surgeries. In total, 6,931 patients were included for analysis. Outcome Measures The primary outcome was composite morbidity, which was composed of (1) infection (sepsis, surgical-site infection, Clostridium difficile infection, or drug-resistant infection); (2) thrombotic event (pulmonary embolus, deep venous thrombosis, or disseminated intravascular coagulation); (3) kidney injury; (4) respiratory event; and (5) ischemic event (transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident). Materials and Methods Data on intraoperative transfusion were obtained from an automated, prospectively collected anesthesia data management system. Data on postoperative hospital transfusion were obtained through a Web-based intelligence portal. Based on previous research, we analyzed the data using three definitions of a liberal transfusion trigger in patients who underwent red blood cell transfusion: a liberal intraoperative Hb trigger as a nadir Hb level of 10 g/dL or greater, a liberal postoperative Hb trigger as a nadir Hb level of 8 g/dL or greater, or a whole hospital nadir Hb level of 8–10 g/dL. Variables analyzed included in-hospital morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and total costs associated with a liberal transfusion strategy. Results Among patients with a whole hospital stay nadir Hb between 8 and 10 g/dL, transfused patients demonstrated a longer in-hospital stay (median [interquartile range], 6 [5–9] vs. 4 [3–6] days; p<.0001) and a higher perioperative morbidity (n=145 [11.5%] vs. n=74 [6.1%], p<.0001) than those not transfused. Even after adjusting for age, gender, race, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, estimated blood loss, baseline Hb value, and surgery type, logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with a nadir Hb of 8–10 g/dL who were transfused had an independently higher risk of perioperative morbidity (odds ratio=2.11, 95% confidence interval, 1.44-3.09; p<.0001). Estimated additional costs associated with liberal trigger use, defined as a transfusion occurring in patients with a whole hospital stay nadir Hb of 8–10 g/dL, ranged from $202,675 to $700,151 annually. Conclusions Transfusion using a liberal trigger is associated with increased morbidity, even after controlling for possible confounders. Our results suggest that modification of transfusion practice may be a potential area for improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This estimation problem is fundamental for the operation of autonomous robots that are often required to manipulate and grasp objects whose pose is a priori unknown. The nature of tactile measurements, the strict time requirements for real-time operation, and the multimodality of the involved probability distributions pose remarkable challenges and call for advanced nonlinear filtering techniques. Following a Bayesian approach, this paper proposes a novel and effective algorithm, named memory unscented particle filter (MUPF), which solves 6-DOF localization recursively in real time by only exploiting contact point measurements. The MUPF combines a modified particle filter that incorporates a sliding memory of past measurements to better handle multimodal distributions, along with the unscented Kalman filter that moves the particles toward regions of the search space that are more likely with the measurements. The performance of the proposed MUPF algorithm has been assessed both in simulation and on a real robotic system equipped with tactile sensors (i.e., the iCub humanoid robot). The experiments show that the algorithm provides accurate and reliable localization even with a low number of particles and, hence, is compatible with real-time requirements. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we have pointed out that Huang et al.’s scheme is insecure against off-line password guessing attack, insider attack and forgery attack. Beside these, inefficient password update phase can lead to denial of service. To remove these security loopholes, we have proposed an efficient RSA-cryptosystem based remote user authentication scheme using smart card. Security (formal and informal) analysis shows that the proposed scheme provides better security tradeoff than Huang et al.’s scheme. Further, we have simulated our proposed scheme for the formal security verification using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications tool to confirm that the proposed scheme is secure against passive and active attacks. Performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme provides lower computational and communication cost than Huang et al.’s scheme as well as other related competitive existing schemes. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Users of those systems should be assured that the difference between an unknown true position and a system-derived position estimate is bounded with an extremely high degree of confidence. One of the major concerns for meeting this requirement, known as integrity, is ionosphere-induced error or discontinuity of GNSS signals significant enough to threaten the safety of users. The potentially hazardous ionospheric anomalies of interest in this article are ionospheric spatial decorrelation and ionospheric scintillation under disturbed conditions. As the demand of safety-critical navigation applications increases with the rapid growth of the autonomous vehicle sector, ionospheric monitoring and mitigation techniques become more important to support such systems. © 2017 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Although the transaction messages of AFC systems are mostly transferred in plaintext, which is obviously insecure, system operators do not need to pay much attention to this issue, since the AFC network is well isolated from public network (e.g., the Internet). Nevertheless, in recent years, the advent of Near Field Communication (NFC)-equipped smartphones has bridged the gap between the AFC network and the Internet through Host-based Card Emulation (HCE). Motivated by this fact, we design and practice a novel paradigm of attack on modern distance-based pricing AFC systems, enabling users to pay much less than actually required. Our constructed attack has two important properties: 1) it is invisible to AFC system operators because the attack never causes any inconsistency in the backend database of the operators; and 2) it can be scalable to large number of users (e.g., 10,000) by maintaining a moderate-sized AFC card pool (e.g., containing 150 cards). Based upon this constructed attack, we developed an HCE app, named LessPay. Our real-world experiments on LessPay demonstrate not only the feasibility of our attack (with 97.6% success rate), but also its low-overhead in terms of bandwidth and computation. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In the market, there are commercial systems carrying out pre-Analytical tests on biological specimens. An example is provided by the WASPLab, by COPAN Italia S.p.A., which monitors bacterial growth on Petri dishes that contain the samples, by taking and processing images of one dish at a time in a completely automated way. In this paper, we propose a newly monitoring sensor system for all the Petri dishes at the same time for the detection of bacterial growth with the aim of integrating it directly in the WASPLab. It could permit to obtain quantitative information about bacterial activity in real time directly inside the incubator, offering a more rapid and complete diagnosis response and avoiding the movement of the samples. In addition, the user can set measurement parameters according to his/her needs. This allows the system reaching a great level of flexibility. We tested our solution in two ways. First, we analyzed the behavior of the proposed solution comparing the output signals with the data obtained using an impedance analyzer (HP4194A) as reference. We obtained an average deviation equal to 0.768 Ω in magnitude and 0.059 ° in phase angle. Second, we carried out a 24-hour test to monitor the activity of Staphylococcus Aureus AT C 6538 in a climate chamber. We found that our system succeeded in observing bacterial growth, with an early detection time of 4 hours.

Typically, these are obtained by auxiliary sensors directly providing the reference angles (e.g., nose-boom vanes) or by analytically reconstructing them using calibrated airspeed measurements and inertial data. This paper proposes a novel approach in which the reference data for the flow angles calibration are obtained by inertial measurements only. The methodology, aiming to lower the development costs of advanced aircrafts, is developed and validated with reference to the triple-probe air-data system of a Piaggio Aerospace Medium Altitude Long Endurance Unmanned Aerial System. Specific flight tests are carried out for the calibration process, by defining maneuvers that reduce flight time and facilitate the calibration itself. The technique is made of two steps: first, the aloft wind speed is estimated, and the angle-of-attack and sideslip angles are reconstructed; next, the reference data are used to define the calibration polynomials via least-mean squares approximation. The approach effectiveness is presented and discussed with reference to flight tests with three different configurations of flaps extension, by comparing the calibrated results with the data coming from highaccuracy nose-boom vanes.

The UGV sends GPS data corrections to the UAV on the basis of the distance from the UAV to the UGV as measured by scaling of a standard image pattern stuck on the UGV. Geolocation of both UGV and UAV are performed through the use of the extended Kalman filter integrating GPS aided INS. The positioning error is reduced by a factor of 2.3 in simulation studies and a factor of 1.6 in experiment when 3 GPS sensors are used on the UGV. This is better than what one can get through pure averaging of the GPS sensors in the presence of noise in measuring the UAV-UGV distance.

Heritage in Tangancícuaro, Michoacán, Mexico. Symptoms consisted of brown cankers and dieback on canes, accompanied by reddening and wilting of foliage, at an incidence of 5%. Internal symptoms included a brown discoloration of vascular tissues. A total of 30 stem pieces (∼20 cm in length) were collected from 15 diseased plants. Sixty colonies grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25°C developed a white, aerial mycelium that became olivaceous gray at the surface after 5 days. Pycnidia were produced after 2 to 3 weeks on autoclaved pine needles placed on water agar and were solitary or aggregated, dark brown to black, uniloculate, and 320 to 417 μm in diameter. Conidiophores were hyaline, cylindrical, smooth, thin walled, and septate. Conidia were hyaline, fusiform, base subtruncate to bluntly rounded, smooth, thin walled, aseptate, and (13-) 16 to 19 (-21) × (4-) 4.5 to 5.5 (-6) μm (n = 100). These morphological characters were consistent with the description of Neofusicoccum algeriense reported by Berraf-Tebbal et al. (2014). The isolate was deposited in the Culture Collection of Phytopathogenic Fungi of the Department of Agricultural Parasitology at the Chapingo Autonomous University under accession number UACH-138. For accurate identification of this isolate, internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), β-tubulin gene (BT2), and the translation elongation factor 1-α gene (EF1-α) were amplified using universal primers ITS5/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), Bt2a/Bt2b (Glass and Donaldson 1995), and EF1-728F/EF1-986R (Carbone and Kohn 1999), and sequenced. BLAST queries of the sequences shared 99% identity with the ex-type isolate of N. algeriense for BT2 (KX505915) and EF1-α (KJ657715), and 100% with Neofusicoccum sp. for ITS (KX505905). Additionally, maximum likelihood analysis and Bayesian inference using multilocus alignment (ITS, BT2, and EF1-α) placed the isolate in the same clade with ex-type isolate of N. algeriense. Sequences were deposited as GenBank accession nos. KY609176 (ITS), KY609175 (BT2), and KY609174 (EF1-α). The pathogenicity of the isolate of N. algeriense was confirmed on 25 6-month-old red raspberry plants (cv. Heritage). Canes (70 cm long) were wounded (1.5 cm long, 2 mm deep) at 30 cm above ground level using a scalpel. A colonized 8-mm agar plug from a 7-day-old colony growing on PDA was placed on every wound and wrapped with Parafilm. Five red raspberry control plants received only noncolonized PDA plugs. All plants were covered with plastic bags for 72 h and were maintained in a greenhouse at 25°C. The experiment was repeated twice. After 20 days, all inoculated canes developed cankers, internal necrosis of wood, and dieback. No symptoms were observed on the control plants. The pathogen was reisolated from 100% of the inoculated stems, and microscopic examination showed that it was identical morphologically to that originally observed. To our knowledge, this is the first report of N. algeriense causing dieback of red raspberry in Mexico. This pathogen has been reported causing grapevine trunk disease in Algeria (Berraf-Tebbal et al. 2014), and associated with Eucalyptus globulus plantations in Portugal (Barradas et al. 2016). This disease is an emerging threat to red raspberry production in Mexico and must be taken into consideration in future studies on effective management practices. © 2017, American Phytopathological Society.

This technology is used for a wide range of applications including medical sciences, military, industrial manufacturing, electronics, holography, spectroscopy, astronomy and much more. Military operations often demand a secure and timely transmission of a massive amount of information from one place to another. Until now, the military has relied on the radio spectrum for effective communication, which is vulnerable to security threats and susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI). Also, this spectrum is hard-pressed to meet the current bandwidth requirement for high-resolution images, on-air video conferencing and real-time data transfer. Therefore, the focus has shifted to visible and infrared spectrum using laser technology which is capable of providing secure data transfer because of its immunity to EMI. The probability of intercepting a laser signal is very low due to its narrow beam divergence and coherent optical beam, making the laser a suitable candidate for secure military tactical operations. Besides the communication aspect, the highly directive nature of a laser beam is also used as a directed energy laser weapon. These highly powerful and light weighted directed energy laser weapons are very cost-effective countermeasures for airborne threats. Furthermore, laser sensors are deployed in the battlefield or in space for tracking the path of a wide range of military vehicles like missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, fighter aircraft, warships, submarines, and so on. Advancements in space operations and laser technology have offered synergistic possibilities of using lasers from space-based platforms during military operations. In this paper, we are providing our readers with a comprehensive study of laser applications, used by the military, to carry out tactical operations on the ground or space-based platforms. Also, an intensive investigation on the development of laser technology for sensors, range-finders and target designators that are used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance is presented in the paper. The advancement of laser communication for military purposes and its current state of the art is reviewed as well as some recent scientific developments in the area of high-energy directed laser weapons are discussed, which have revolutionized military battlefields.

The novelty of the algorithm is its capability to control the vehicle to avoid obstacles at high speed taking into account dynamical safety constraints through a simultaneous optimization of reference speed and steering angle without a priori knowledge about the environment and without a reference trajectory to follow. Previous work in this specific context optimized only the steering command. In this paper, obstacles are detected using a planar light detection and ranging sensor. A multi-phase optimal control problem is then formulated to simultaneously optimize the reference speed and steering angle within the detection range. Vehicle acceleration capability as a function of speed, as well as stability and handling concerns such as preventing wheel lift-off, are included as constraints in the optimization problem, whereas the cost function is formulated to navigate the vehicle as quickly as possible with smooth control commands. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of safely exploiting the dynamic limits of the vehicle while navigating the vehicle through sensed obstacles of different sizes and numbers. It is also shown that the proposed variable speed formulation can significantly improve performance by allowing navigation of obstacle fields that would otherwise not be cleared with steering control alone. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Accurately modeling traffic, therefore, is critically important for autonomous driving simulation on threat assessment, trajectory planning, etc. Traditionally when modeling traffic, the motion of traffic vehicles is often considered to be deterministic and modeled based on its governing physics. However, the sensed or perceived motion of traffic vehicles can be full of errors or inaccuracy due to the inaccurate and/or incomplete sensing information. In addition, it is naturally true that any future trajectories are unknown. This paper proposes a novel modeling method on traffic considering its motion uncertainties, based on Gaussian process (GP). A probability distribution function is employed to represent traffic vehicles' future trajectories, which are further classified based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) into typical motion trajectories. Then the GP-based motion model is built from the typical motion trajectories. With this model, any potential trajectories of traffic vehicles can be simulated by sampling the GP conditional distribution. The experiment has been performed in a high-fidelity driving simulator with a full-motion base. The results have demonstrated that the proposed GP-based model can faithfully represent the uncertainties of traffic vehicles motion, thus, is suitable for the high-fidelity simulation of autonomous driving systems.

Rapid identification of this pathogen may accelerate treatment and reduce mortality in the event of a bioterrorism attack. We developed a rapid and sensitive assay to detect B. anthracis bacteremia using a system that is suitable for point-of-care testing. A filter-based cartridge that included both sample processing and PCR amplification functions was loaded with all reagents needed for sample processing and multiplex nested PCR. The assay limit of detection (LOD) and dynamic range were determined by spiking B. anthracis DNA into individual PCR mixtures and B. anthracis CFU into human blood. One-milliliter blood samples were added to the filter-based detection cartridge and tested for B. anthracis on a GeneXpert instrument. Assay specificity was determined by testing blood spiked with non-anthrax bacterial isolates or by testing blood samples drawn from patients with concurrent non-B. anthracis bacteremia or nonbacteremic controls. The assay LODs were 5 genome equivalents per reaction and 10 CFU/ml blood for both the B. anthracis Sterne and V1B strains. There was a 6-log10 dynamic range. Assay specificity was 100% for tests of non-B. anthracis bacterial isolates and patient blood samples. Assay time was less than 90 min. This automated system suitable for point-ofcare detection rapidly identifies B. anthracis directly from blood with high sensitivity.

It is the most prominent heart disease around the globe, and its prevalence increases with age factors. Accurate and timely identification and treatment of MI help to prevent from series of dreadful ischemic heart diseases such as heart attack and heart failure. However, the manual interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) for diagnosis of MI is tedious task for physicians. Hence, automated classification is very useful for diagnosis of MI condition. Our study presents an approach for automated diagnosis of MI condition using ECG beats. In this methodology, non-linearity in ECG is finely captured using higher-order statistics (HOS), and then, dimensionality is reduced. Confidence interval of features is verified using Student’s t-test (probability (p)-value <0.05). Decision Tree (DT) as the base classifier following different ensemble classifiers, viz. Adaboost (ADB), Bagging (BGG), Rotation Forest (ROF) and Random Forest (RAF) are subjected for diagnosis of normal sinus rhythm (NSR) against MI conditions. Among these, ROF is diagnosed with 99.51 ± 0.31 % accuracy, 98.82 ± 1.04 % sensitivity and 99.83 ± 0.15 % specificity. In this system, higher specificity rate defines precision in diagnosis of True Negative (TN) condition.

In this paper, we present an Auto Security Development Framework (ASDF) to build trustworthy and highly secure auto information and entertainment services. The ASDF enables developers to consider security issues at all the auto car communications layers and integrate security algorithms with the functions and services offered in each layer rather than considering security in an ad-hoc and after thought manner.

In this paper the aerodynamic characteristics of the prototype in the longitudinal direction are presented in terms of lift coefficient, drag coefficient, and pitching moment coefficient obtained from wind tunnel tests. The tests are conducted on a 1/4 scaled half model aircraft placed in UiTM Low Speed Tunnel at wind speed of 20 m/s, 25 m/s, 30 m/s, 35 m/s and 40 m/s representing Reynolds number in the order of 105. For each wind speed, the angle of attack is varied from -10° to 64° to observe the full capability of the aircraft. Visualisation using thread tufts is also executed to see the flow pattern on the surface of the aircraft at certain angles. The results show that the maximum lift coefficient is around 0.65 at 28° angle of attack, the minimum drag coefficient is below 0.03 at zero angle of attack, and the maximum lift-to-drag ratio is about 20 at 3° angle of attack. The pitching moment curve indicates a static stability with negative slope between -7° to 10° angle of attack. Visualisation shows the flow separation progress on the surface of canard, wing and fuselage. © 2017 Faculty of Mechanical Engineering.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Intrinsically a combinatorial problem, secure state estimation has been traditionally addressed either by brute force search, suffering from scalability issues, or via convex relaxations, using algorithms that can terminate in polynomial time but are not necessarily sound. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that uses a satisfiability modulo theory approach to harness the complexity of secure state estimation. We leverage results from formal methods over real numbers to provide guarantees on the soundness and completeness of our algorithm. Moreover, we discuss its scalability properties, by providing upper bounds on the runtime performance. Numerical simulations support our arguments by showing an order of magnitude decrease in execution time with respect to alternative techniques.

This approach, in which the left and right views are encoded with different levels of quality, relies on the perceptual theory of binocular suppression. However, to ensure comfortable 3D viewing, the just-noticeable level of asymmetry, i.e., the maximum quality gap between views, has to be carefully defined. Both subjectively and empirically fixed thresholds of asymmetry demonstrated either the maladjustment to content or dependency to the experimental design. This paper describes a new nonuniform asymmetric stereoscopic video coding method adaptively adjusting the level of asymmetry for each region of the image based on its perceptual significance. The proposed method uses a fully automated model that dynamically determines the best bounds of asymmetry for which the 3D viewing experience will not be altered. This is achieved by exploiting several human-visual-system-inspired models, namely, the binocular just-noticeable difference, and the visual saliency map and depth information. The simulation results show that the proposed method results in bit rate saving of up to 26% and provides better 3D visual quality compared with state-of-the-art asymmetric coding methods. © 2017 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

During a spoofing attack, authentic signals are contaminated by spoofing signals. We demonstrate that all spoofing signals can be eliminated by projecting the received signal onto the orthogonal null space of the spoofing signals. Moreover, two types of receiver structures are designed: A centralized structure that has the ability to suppress cross-correlation interference and a distributed structure with lower computational complexity and lower projection power losses.

We hypothesize that bradycardias are a result of transient temporal destabilization of the cardiac autonomic control system and that fluctuations in the heart rate signal might contain information that precedes bradycardia. We investigate infant heart rate fluctuations with a novel application of point process theory. Methods: In ten preterm infants, we estimate instantaneous linear measures of the heart rate signal, use these measures to extract statistical features of bradycardia, and propose a simplistic framework for prediction of bradycardia. Results: We present the performance of a prediction algorithm using instantaneous linear measures (mean area under the curve = 0.79 ± 0.018) for over 440 bradycardia events. The algorithm achieves an average forecast time of 116 s prior to bradycardia onset (FPR = 0.15). Our analysis reveals that increased variance in the heart rate signal is a precursor of severe bradycardia. This increase in variance is associated with an increase in power from low content dynamics in the LF band (0.04-0.2 Hz) and lower multiscale entropy values prior to bradycardia. Conclusion: Point process analysis of the heartbeat time series reveals instantaneous measures that can be used to predict infant bradycardia prior to onset. Significance: Our findings are relevant to risk stratification, predictive monitoring, and implementation of preventative strategies for reducing morbidity and mortality associated with bradycardia in neonatal intensive care units. © 2017 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, most existing methods have limitations in deployment cost, privacy exposure, and inconvenience for residents. To cope with the limitations, this paper presents a new indoor ADL recognition system especially for OPH. To minimize the deployment cost as well as the intrusions to user and house, we exploit an IoT-based environment-sensing device, called Autonomous Sensor Box (SensorBox) which can autonomously measure 7 kinds of environment attributes. We apply machine-learning techniques to the collected data, and predicts 7 kinds of ADLs. We conduct an experiment within an actual apartment of a single user.

Apart from flying these helicopters at a super-low altitude and low speed, using an efficient and optimum rotor blade ensures a uniform and deep penetration of pesticide and fertilizers over a specified area. Accordingly, this work attempts to optimize the rotor blade of an AUH by using coupling statistics and several numerical techniques, including design of experiments, response surface method, and computational fluid dynamics. The experiments are designed using the central composite design method and by selecting the geometric variables that affect the aerodynamic performance of the rotor blade, including the root chord, tip chord, and angle of attack. The angle at the root and tip is optimized in order for the resulting twist to produce a uniform blade loading, achieve maximum lift, and minimize the required hover power. The required aerodynamic forces and limited availability of engine power are identified as constraints. The blade is optimized only when the helicopter is hovering at a persistent rotational speed, and the hover efficiency of the rotor blade with an optimal twist distribution is significantly higher than the baseline. © 2017, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This scheme uses 4 agencies, namely, security, routing, underwater gateway, and vehicle, which are embedded with static and mobile agents. (1) Agents in security agency of a node discover secured neighbors by using the direction of arrival estimation and authentication, (2) agents in routing agency of a node establish secured routes from source to surface gateway, (3) agents in Underwater Gateway Agency communicate with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and underwater nodes for key distribution, and (4) vehicle traversing agency in AUV coordinates with Underwater Gateway Agency for changing AUVs traversal to cover the isolated network area.

Distributed agreement protocols can play a key role to establish a common view on context parameters and to coordinate joint actions. Due to the harsh environmental conditions in some of these scenarios and their safety critical nature such protocols need to tolerate arbitrary faults and even malicious attacks.This paper presents a framework for Byzantine fault tolerant agreement for small-sized groups of autonomous, wirelessly connected systems. It focuses, besides providing support for general purpose value agreement, on the agreement of distributed sensor readings. The latter enables to establish a joint view on context conditions, thereby building the basis for joint coordinated actions. As classical Byzantine fault tolerant agreement protocols require 3t + 1 participants to tolerate t faulty nodes, we also consider a hybrid fault model by utilizing a trusted subsystem, which can only be subject to crashes. The latter reduces the required group size for agreement to 2t + 1 nodes and reduces the message complexity of the protocol, which is essential for the targeted scenarios. The experiment results show that the trusted subsystem can effectively increase the efficiency. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, full exploitation of the potential of point cloud data for efficient and automatic object recognition remains elusive. Recently, feature-based methods have become very popular in object recognition on account of their good performance in capturing object details. Compared with global features describing the whole shape of the object, local features recording the fractional details are more discriminative and are applicable for object classes with considerable similarity. In this paper, we propose a two-step classification approach based on point feature histograms and the bag-of-features method for automatic recognition of similar objects in mobile lidar point clouds. Lamp post, street light and traffic sign are grouped as one category in the first-step classification for their inter similarity compared with tree and vehicle. A finer classification of the lamp post, street light and traffic sign based on the result of the first-step classification is implemented in the second step.

In VFM, low-fidelity modeling's (LF) role is to capture the trend of objectives while the high-fidelity modeling's (HF) role is to revise the accuracy of LF. LF and HF are fused through bridge function (BF) and then finish the approximation for true model. This paper adopts VFM to predict autonomous underwater vehicle's (AUV) hydrodynamic parameters (drag, lift and torque coefficients) on certain velocity and angle of attack, in which LF, HF are built using RBF and BF is built using Kriging. Crossover operator of genetic algorithm produces candidate sample set and the sample with maximum error between VFM and HF will be chosen as newly added sample. Finally, VFM is established with all samples. The results show that compared to HF, VFM can describe precisely the change of hydrodynamic parameters in design space.

Specifically, one active attacker who introduces errors, in addition to one or many passive attackers who amplify the error, may, by the modification of a single parameter, induce oscillatory traffic jams that cause delay, driver discomfort, excess energy expenditure, and increased risk of accidents that could result in serious injury or death. We determine the conditions under which an attacker(s) is able to violate the primary design criterion of automated vehicle streams, known as string stability, to guarantee system instability. Furthermore, we prove that once the stream has been destabilized it will continually deviate from the desired state, even in the absence of additional input to the system-i.e. the jammed condition will self-perpetuate. Through a comparison with a behavioral human driver model, this work demonstrates that automated vehicle systems are more vulnerable to disruption than their non-automated counterparts. The postulated attack is demonstrated on a scaled system and identification of attackers is discussed. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Official reports stated that around 15000 tons of heavy fuel oil spilled in sea water. The spill threatened the maritime and human life and caused severe environmental disasters. On an international scale, the European Space Agency (ESA) stated that more than 4.5 million tons of oil is the estimate of the annual spill worldwide. Therefore, it is really crucial to have an oil spill detection system that is able to specify the spill area and to provide statistical information about the situation.

Sensing information can be collected by using existing network infrastructures, but also by adopting small, cheap and configurable aerial vehicles, namely drones. Our work focusses on studying how to optimize their adoption for smart city applications designed to gather sensing data from user's devices roaming on the ground. To this purpose, we used HUMsim, a tool which generates realistic human traces, to mimic pedestrian mobility. From this dataset, we extract some sociality features that we exploit to plan a social-aware drone trajectory with the goal of maximizing the opportunities of interaction between drone and devices. Our experiments compare social-aware and social-oblivious trajectories showing that knowing the way people move and interact boosts the amount of retrievable data. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Besides the numerous benefits of global network expansion, secure communication and authentication among the comprising elements of the global network is also posing great challenges. Recently, Huang et al. proposed a key agreement scheme in order to facilitate user authenticity using elliptic curve cryptography. Huang et al. further emphasized the scheme is secure. Nevertheless, comprehensive analysis in this paper, demonstrates that Huang et al. scheme has correctness issues and is prone to impersonation/forgery attack. Then an improved scheme is presented to tenacity the said glitches existent in Huang et al.’s scheme. The security analysis of proposed scheme is substantiated in random oracle model. Furthermore, a simulation of proposed scheme is carried out by automated formal tool ProVerif. The performance and security assessments show that the scheme presented in this paper withstand impersonation attack and offers adequate security while reducing significant computation cost as compared with Huang et al.’s scheme.

Traditionally, visual features such as spectrogram were often extracted for human operators to identify the micro-Doppler signature (mDS) of UAVs, i.e. sinusoidal modulation. In this paper, the authors aim to design a system for machine automatic classification of UAVs from other targets, particularly from birds as both UAVs and birds are small and slow-moving radar targets. Most existing mDS representations such as spectrogram, cepstrogram and cadence velocity diagram discard the phase spectrum, and only make use of the magnitude spectrum. What's more, people often take the logarithm of the spectrum to enlarge the weak mDS but without sufficient care, as noise may be enlarged at the same time. The authors thus propose a regularized 2-D complex-log-Fourier transform to address these problems. Furthermore, the authors propose an object-oriented dimension-reduction technique: subspace reliability analysis, which directly removes the unreliable feature dimensions of two class-conditional covariance matrices in two separate subspaces. On the benchmark dataset, the proposed approach demonstrates better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches. More specifically, the proposed approach significantly reduces the equal error rate of the second best approach, cadence velocity diagram, from 6.68% to 3.27%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

The autonomous emergency braking (AEB) is one of important vehicle intelligent safety technologies to avoid or mitigate collision. The AEB system applies the vehicle brakes when a collision is eminent in spite of any reaction by the driver. In some technologies, the system forewarns the driver with an acoustic signal when a collision is still avoidable, but subsequently applies the brakes automatically if the driver fails to respond. This paper presents the development and implementation of a rear-end collision avoidance system based on hierarchical control framework which consists of threat assessment layer, wheel slip ratio control layer and integrated-electro-hydraulic brake (IEHB) actuator control layer. The threat assessment layer continuously calculates threat metrics associated with collision avoidance by braking control. The tire slip ratio control layer with radial basis function (RBF) neural network control based on robust compensation term (RCT) is designed to obtain a desired braking torque, which enabled the controlled vehicle to generate the highest possible deceleration. As for the I-EHB actuator control layer, a resembling pulse width modulation (PWM) control method is adopted to convert the regulation information of the upper controller into the PMSM torque, the valve status (open / closed), and the hydraulic pump status (enabled / disabled). Finally, simulation test is conducted via co-simulation platform of MATLAB/Simulink and AMESim under scenarios of the active emergency braking process on high adhesion coefficient road and low adhesion coefficient road. The results show that the proposed AEB system control scheme is verified. Copyright © 2017 SAE International.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Platooning is a method of guiding a group of vehicles whereby a lead vehicle determines the speed/velocity of the vehicles that follow. A cooperative following strategy is then employed by the followers to maintain a desired separation between themselves. In this way a group of vehicles acts as a single unit, which has been shown to have many safety and efficiency benefits. Existing work, however, demonstrates that a disruptive member of a platoon is capable of causing the rest of the platoon to increase its total energy expenditure, or even destabilizing the platoon, which could result in catastrophic accidents. Knowledge about the position and velocity of each vehicle can help deter such attacks by attributing the disruption to the specific vehicle causing it.One way to achieve this is to assume that the lead vehicle is trusted and equipped with a camera so as to watch over the platoon and identify deviations from reported positions/velocities. As platoons often move in a straight line, it might be impossible for the leader to obtain a direct view of all the vehicles in the platoon. Under a broad range of circumstances, however, a direct view of the vehicle or the shadows of the vehicles are visible to the leader. In this work we investigate whether the differential distance between shadows, as viewed through a monocular camera, can reveal that the distance between two vehicles has changed over time, and thus serve as a mechanism to verify positions claims. When a direct view of the vehicle is not achievable, the use of shadows to detect the relative positions of vehicles under a variety of weather and daylight conditions are considered. Our analysis finds that shadow analysis can be used in sequential images to detect practical changes in the distance between two vehicles for visible shadows in non-light-of-sightscenarios. We also present the analysis to efficiently use the technique as the position of the Sun changes through out the day for a given site location. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Manually crafting software controllers for these vehicles is difficult, but there has been some success in using deep neural networks generated usingmachine-learning. However, deep neural networks are opaque to human engineers, rendering their correctness very difficult to provemanually; and existing automated techniques, which were not designed to operate on neural networks, fail to scale to large systems. This paper focuses on proving the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks, i.e. proving that small perturbations to a correctly-classified input to the network cannot cause it to be misclassified. We describe some of our recent and ongoing work on verifying the adversarial robustness of networks, and discuss some of the open questions we have encountered and how they might be addressed.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

It makes use of the homography matrix between two images of a planar scene as feedback information while the system dynamics are exploited in a cascade manner in a control design: An outer-loop control defines a reference setpoint based on the homography matrix and an inner-loop control ensures the stabilization of the setpoint by assigning the thrust and torque controls. Unlike conventional solutions that only consider the system kinematics, the proposed control scheme is novel in considering the full system dynamics (incorporating all degrees of freedom, nonlinearities, and couplings, as well as interactions with the surrounding fluid) and in not requiring information of the relative depth and normal vector of the observed scene. Augmented with integral corrections, the proposed controller is robust with respect to model uncertainties and disturbances. The almost global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is demonstrated, which is the largest domain of attraction one can achieve by means of continuous feedback control. Simulation results illustrating these properties on a realistic AUV model subjected to a sea current are presented and finally experimental results on a real AUV are reported. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In order to exploit this result for variety improvement in the Sugar Research Australia breeding program, three different Tc measurement systems were assessed for their accuracy, genetic correlation of measured Tc with cane yield (tonnes cane per hectare, TCH) and trait (Tc) and heritability. The methods include manual ground-level Tc measurements taken at 3-6 month crop age, aerial screening using UAV-assisted infra-red and optical imagery and continuous real-time absolute Tc measurements using ArduCrop infra-red radiometers. Significant genetic variation for Tc among genotypes was detected with all three methods, with aerial screening and ArduCrop being more accurate and useful than manual groundlevel measurements. Both UAV-aided and ArduCrop-based Tc measurements showed high heritability and high negative genetic correlation under variable moisture conditions. Results of field experiments suggest that aerial Tc measurements taken under the appropriate conditions will be an effective, rapid screening method for selecting superior, water-efficient and high-yielding clones from large breeding trials. © 2016 Informa Plc.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Historic evolution of health care has led to significant healthcare sector fragmentation, resulting in systemic inefficiencies and suboptimal resource exploitation. To attain a sustainable healthcare model, fundamental, system-wide improvements that effectively network, and ensure fulfilment of potential synergies between sectors, and include and facilitate coherent strategic planning and organisation of healthcare infrastructure are needed. Critically, they must be specifically designed to sustainably achieve peak performance within the current policy environment for cost-control, and efficiency and quality improvement for service delivery. We propose creation of a new healthcare cluster, to be embedded in existing healthcare systems. It consists of (i) local 24/7 walk-in virtually autonomous do-it-yourself Digital Medical Centres performing routine diagnosis, monitoring, prevention, treatment and standardized documentation and health outcome assessment/reporting, which are online interfaced with (ii) regional 24/7 eClinician Centres providing on-demand clinical supervision/assistance to Digital Medical Centre patients. Both of these are, in turn, online interfaced with (iii) the National Clinical Informatics Centre, which houses the national patient data centre (cloud) and data analysis units that conduct patient- and population-level, personalized and predictive(-medicine) intervention optimization analyses. The National Clinical Informatics Centre also interfaces with biomedical research and prioritizes and accelerates the translation of new discoveries into clinical practice. The associated Health Policy Innovation and Evaluation Centre rapidly integrates new findings with health policy/regulatory discussions. This new cluster would synergistically link all health system components in a circular format, enable not only access by all arms of the health service to latest patient data, but also automatic algorithm analysis and prediction of clinical development of individual patients, reduce bureaucratic burden on medical professionals by enabling a greater level of focus of their expertise on non-routine medical tasks, lead to automatic translation of aggregate patient data/new knowledge into medical practice, and orient future evolution of health systems towards greater cohesion/integration and hence efficiency. A central plank of the proposed concept is increased emphasis on reduction of disease incidence and severity, to diminish both patient suffering and treatment costs. This will be achieved at the individual and population levels, through (i) significantly improved access to medical services, (ii) stronger focus on primary and secondary prevention and early treatment measures, and disease susceptibility prediction via personalized medicine, involving inter alia genome analysis at birth and periodic analysis of microbiomes and biomarkers, and integration with other patient health and epidemiology parameters, (iii) improved surveillance and (iv) intervention outcome benchmarking. The dMCs will become drivers of innovation and integrative evolution in health systems, of disease reduction and efficiency gains, and thus major contributors to development of sustainability of health care. © 2017 The Authors.

With the combined drivers of climate change and human activities, eutrophication has expanded from warm shallow lakes to cold-water lakes in relatively high latitude regions and has raised greater concerns over lake aquatic ecosystem health. A two-year field study was carried out to investigate water quality, phytoplankton characteristics and eutrophication status in a typical alpine glacial lake of Tianchi, a scenic area and an important drinking water source in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China, in 2014 and 2015. Clear seasonal and annual variations of nutrients and organic pollutants were found especially during rainy seasons. For the phytoplankton community, Bacillariophyta held the dominant position in terms of both species and biomass throughout the year, suggesting the dominant characteristics of diatoms in the phytoplankton structure in such a high-altitude cold-water lake. This was quite different from plain and warm lakes troubled with cyanobacterial blooming. Moreover, the dominant abundance of Cyclotella sp. in Tianchi might suggest regional warming caused by climate change, which might have profound effects on the local ecosystems and hydrological cycle. Based on water quality parameters, a comprehensive trophic level index TLI (Σ) was calculated to estimate the current status of eutrophication, and the results inferred emerging eutrophication in Tianchi. Results from Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and correlation analysis of phytoplankton genera and physico-chemical variables of water indicated that abiotic factors significantly influenced the phytoplankton community and its succession in Tianchi Lake. These abiotic factors could explain 77.82% of the total variance, and ammonium was identified as the most discriminant variable, which could explain 41% of the total variance followed by TP (29%). An estimation of annual nutrient loadings to Tianchi was made, and the results indicated that about 212.97 t of total nitrogen and 32.14 t of total phosphorus were transported into Tianchi Lake annually. Human socio-economic activities (runoff caused by historical overgrazing and increasing tourism) were identified as the most important contributors to Tianchi nutrient loadings. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In addition to infrastructure investments, Changi Airport has also been investing in technology to improve the customers' experience and enhance operations efficiency. Examples of these are data analytics and cloud solutions, robotics, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, internet of things and many more. However, the deployment of new technologies alone will not be sufficient to keep Changi ahead, as IT systems and applications become more readily available and commoditised.

The attack exploits vulnerabilities in web browsers and their extensions for unnoticeably downloading malicious software. Often, the victim is sent through a long chain of redirection operations in order to take down the offending pages. Concretely, the attack is triggered when a user visits a benign webpage that is compromised by the attacker (called landing page) and is inserted some malicious code inside. The user is then automatically redirected to an actual page that installs malware on the user's computer (called distribution page) without his/her consent or knowledge. While there is a large body of works targeting on detection of drive-by download attack, there is little attention on the redirection which is a crucial characteristic of the attack. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an approach to the classification of landing and distribution domains which are important components forming the head and tail of a redirection chain in the attack. The methodology in our approach is to use machine learning for text mining on the registered information of the domains called whois.

The characteristics of the realistic wing kinematics are presented. The results show that the non-dimensional rotating speed is a linear function of non-dimensional flapping frequency regardless of the initial angles of attack. Moreover, the effects of wing kinematics on aerodynamic force production and the underlying mechanism are analyzed.

The localization capability has been added on top of an existing network, without imposing constraints on its structure/operation. The approach is based on the inclusion of timing information within acoustic messages through which it is possible to know the time of an acoustic transmission in relation to its reception. Exploiting such information at the network application level makes it possible to create an interrogation scheme similar to that of a long baseline. The advantage is that the nodes/autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) themselves become the transponders of a network baseline, and hence there is no need for dedicated instrumentation. The paper reports at sea results obtained from the COLLAB–NGAS14 experimental campaign. During the sea trial, the approach was implemented within an operational network in different configurations to support the navigation of the two Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation Ocean Explorer (CMRE OEX) vehicles. The obtained results demonstrate that it is possible to support AUV navigation without constraining the network design and with a minimum communication overhead. Alternative solutions (e.g., synchronized clocks or two-way-travel-time interrogations) might provide higher precision or accuracy, but they come at the cost of impacting on the network design and/or on the interrogation strategies. Results are discussed, and the performance achieved at sea demonstrates the viability to use the system in real, large-scale operations involving multiple AUVs.

It has been shown that reducing inter-vehicle separations to less than one car length results in the most benefits for the whole platoon; however, this poses a number of challenges. In particular, it becomes difficult to guarantee a collision-free braking in an emergency situation considering that individual vehicles may have different braking capacities in real-life settings - due to, for example, different load conditions, etc. Although control-theoretic approaches can be used to design a platoon's cruise operation, emergency braking leads to saturation, i.e., the maximum possible braking force is applied so as to stop the platoon in the shortest possible time and needs to be designed separately. In this paper, we address this issue and introduce a cyber-physical approach that guarantees a collision-free braking in emergency situations. The proposed approach exploits space buffers contained in between vehicles and can be configured to reduce stopping distance and platoon length, while maximizing aerodynamic benefits. We evaluate our approach based on realistic simulations with vehicle dynamics models typically used in the automotive industry for hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) testing. The effects of communication loss during platoon operation are also considered and fail-safe mechanisms are proposed and investigated. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Its great practical importance is mainly due to surveillance tasks of unmanned aerial vehicles. The problem constitutes a combination of the well-studied Dubins traveling salesman problem and the flight path planning problem. We present heuristic algorithms that are based on different strategies of extending a tour by inserting new landmarks. Each insert operation comprises the optimization of overflight directions for the given sequence of landmarks. Path finding between landmarks is done by a discrete routing model. It allows arbitrary flight directions and turn angles as well as maneuvers of different strengths, thus fully exploiting the flight capabilities of the aircraft. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated for agile and less agile aerial vehicles, using randomly generated scenarios with obstacles of different size and number. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This paper aims to overcome the shortcomings of the wolf pack algorithm (WPA), such as slow rate of convergence and low convergence precision, by improving the three intelligent behaviors of the WPA, namely, scouting, summoning, and beleaguering. To improve the scouting behavior, interactive scouting is proposed to increase the interactivity among wolf pack. Furthermore, to improve the summoning behavior, a prey-based adaptive step model is established to improve the searching ability. Finally, calculation rules of new beleaguering behavior are designed, which enhance the local fine search ability considerably. A fast path planning method based on dubins path was proposed, which applied the dubins path planning to meet angle control constraint and tunes the turning radius to meet control constraint. The dubins path planning method based on the modified WPA is proposed by establishing the underwater environment threat model under the condition of autonomous underwater vehicle constraint. The path between the path points is the shortest, the threat is minimal, and the energy consumption is the least without the consideration of ocean current. Simulation results show that the modified WPA has a high rate of convergence and good local search capability in the high-precision, high-dimensional, and multi-peak function; moreover, it does not converge prematurely. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Traditionally, different sensing techniques are exploited with sonar being the most often used to extract depth information and to avoid obstacles. However, little has been published on complete control systems that utilize robotic vision for such underwater applications. This paper provides a proof of concept regarding a series of experiments investigating the use of stereo vision for underwater obstacle avoidance and position estimation. The test platform has been a ROV equipped with two industrial cameras and external light sources. Methods for underwater calibration, disparity map and 3D point cloud processing have been used, to obtain more reliable information about obstacles in front of the ROV. Results from laboratory research work and from field experiments demonstrate that underwater obstacle avoidance with stereo cameras is possible and can increase the autonomous capabilities of ROVs by providing appropriate information for navigation, path planning, safer missions and environment awareness. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
"An eHealth intervention to promote physical activity and social network of single, chronically impaired older adults: Adaptation of an existing intervention using intervention mapping","2017","JMIR Research Protocols","10.2196/resprot.8093","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042296709&doi=10.2196%2fresprot.8093&partnerID=40&md5=66440724306356ecac48051a3a08a58b","Background: Especially for single older adults with chronic diseases, physical inactivity and a poor social network are regarded as serious threats to their health and independence. The Active Plus intervention is an automated computer-tailored eHealth intervention that has been proven effective to promote physical activity (PA) in the general population of adults older than 50 years. Objective: The aim of this study was to report on the methods and results of the systematic adaptation of Active Plus to the wishes and needs of the subgroup of single people older than 65 years who have one or more chronic diseases, as this specific target population may encounter specific challenges regarding PA and social network. Methods: The Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol was used to systematically adapt the existing intervention to optimally suit this specific target population. A literature study was performed, and quantitative as well as qualitative data were derived from health care professionals (by questionnaires, n=10) and the target population (by focus group interviews, n=14), which were then systematically integrated into the adapted intervention. Results: As the health problems and the targeted behavior are largely the same in the original and adapted intervention, the outcome of the needs assessment was that the performance objectives remained the same. As found in the literature study and in data derived from health professionals and focus groups, the relative importance and operationalization of the relevant psychosocial determinants related to these objectives are different from the original intervention, resulting in a refinement of the change objectives to optimally fit the specific target population. This refinement also resulted in changes in the practical applications, program components, intervention materials, and the evaluation and implementation strategy for the subgroup of single, chronically impaired older adults. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the adaptation of an existing intervention is an intensive process in which adopting the IM protocol is an invaluable tool. The study provides a broad insight in adapting interventions aimed at single older adults with a chronic disease. It is concluded that even when the new target population is a sizable segment of the original target population, the adapted intervention still needs considerable changes to optimally fit the needs and situational differences of the narrower target population. © 2017 JMIR Publications Inc.

While exploiting various mapping techniques to build an inner representation of the environment, one of the most famous remaining is occupancy grid mapping. It has been applied to all domains in a 2D/3D fashion for localization, mapping, navigation, and safe path traversal. Until now generally active range measuring sensors like LiDAR or SONAR are exploited to build those maps. With this work the authors want to overcome these barriers by presenting an occupancy mapping framework offering a generic sensor interface. The interface handles occupancy grids as inverse sensor models, which may represent knowledge on different semantical decision levels and therefore build up a semantic grid map stack. The framework offers buffered memory management for efficient storing and shifting and further services for accessing the 2D map stack in different cell-wise pre-fused and topometric ways. Within the framework, two novel techniques operating especially with occupancy grids are presented: First, a novel odds based interpolation filter is introduced, which scales grid maps in a Bayesian way. Second, a Supercell Extracted via Variance-Driven Sampling (SEVDS) algorithm is presented which, abstracts the semantical occupancy grid stack to a topometric map. While this work focuses on the framework's introduction, it is extended by the evaluation of SEVDS against state-of-the-art superpixel approaches to prove its applicability. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Despite they are commonly and efficiently used for this purpose, the recent literature about navigation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) demonstrates that they can represent a valuable support for these systems. Measurements of the AUV position can be exploited as observations within the onboard navigation filter to limit the drift of the state estimation error, unavoidable drawback in case of dead reckoning based approaches. This way, the AUVs can indeed be involved in longterm missions without the necessity of periodic surfacing to get GPS signal for estimation error reset. The paper presents some deductions derived by a considerable set of acoustic position measurements obtained through an EvoLogics S2CR 18/34 USBL modem used in two different configurations (fixed to a tripod on the bottom and floating on the surface). Different results were obtained in the two cases. The proposed analysis of the results will be a solid base for the optimization of the configuration of an USBL-aided navigation system for AUVs that the authors plan to implement and test in the coming future.

Speech and deictic (pointing) gestures were combined to instruct the car about desired interventions which include spatial references to the current environment (e.g., ""stop over [pointing] there"" or ""take [pointing] this parking lot""). In this way, advantages from both modalities were exploited: Speech allows for selecting from many maneuvres and functions in the car (e.g., stop, park), whereas deictic gestures provide a natural and intuitive way of indicating spatial discourse referents used in these interventions (e.g., near this tree, that parking lot). The speech and pointing gesture input was compared to speech and touch-based input in a user study with 38 participants. The touch-based input was selected as a baseline due to its widespread use in in-car touch screens. The evaluation showed that speech and pointing gestures are perceived more natural, intuitive and less cognitively demanding compared to speech and touch and are thus recommended as NCSSs intervention technique for autonomous driving. © 2017 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The black hole attack is an attack vector that can significantly reduce the availability of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) and prevent communication between vehicles entirely. We propose a solution to help secure these networks against this vulnerability by detecting the attack and removing the malicious node from the network.

One critical aspect to enable the use of such vehicles is the coordination/planning system, whose task complexity increases with the number of vehicles and the communications constraints that arise due to their small size and large distances. In this work, we propose a control architecture for a platoon of relay UAVs that are independent of the coordination system. The platoon task consists in interconnecting the communication link between the possibly mobile command station and a UAV in a mission. The relays are actively driven to deploy, create a network and maintain a desired Quality-of-Service (QoS) level, defined in this paper. We present an architecture that is composed by a waypoint generator based on the network QoS and a Time Coordinated Path Following (TCPF) controller with a method to reduce the frequency of information exchange between the relay UAVs, through the use of a self-triggered control strategy. Exploiting this architecture, it is possible to plan a mission operation for a UAV without the need of considering vehicle-to-command-station communication constraints that will be satisfied by the introduction of the relay-UAVs platoon. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the developed strategy. The self-triggered approach results in significant reduction of information exchange between the relay UAVs, while maintaining the user desired network QoS. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

All these effects have negative impact on the maneuverability, stall behavior, range and general operational capabilities of UAVs. Additionally, these results were used in a flight simulator in order to allow the simulation of UAV flights in icing conditions and to study the impact of icing on energy consumption and autopilot responses. Results from the flight simulator show higher angles of attack and higher energy consumption when flying in icing conditions.

In this paper, a transfer learning approach to GOP based mispronunciation detection when applying maximum F1-score criterion (MFC) training to deep neural network (DNN)-hidden Markov model based acoustic models is proposed. Rather than train the whole network using MFC, a DNN is used, whose hidden layers are borrowed from native speech recognition with only the softmax layer trained according to the MFC objective function. As a result, significant mispronunciation detection improvement is obtained. In light of this, the two-stage transfer learning based GOP is investigated in depth. The first stage exploits the hidden layer(s) to extract phonetic-discriminating features. The second stage uses a trainable softmax layer to learn the human standard for judgment. The validation is carried out by experimenting with different mispronunciation detection architectures using acoustic models trained by different criteria. It is found that it is preferable to use frame-level cross-entropy to train the hidden layer parameters. Classifier based mispronunciation detection is further experimented with using features computed by transfer learning based GOP and it is shown that it also helps to achieve better results. © 2017 Acoustical Society of America.","Article","Final","Scopus"

SWs belong to the class of semi-autonomous mobile robots, designed to carry the user from one location to another of his/her choice. For such systems, the localization aspect is of utmost concern, since GPS signal is not available indoors and alternative sensor sets are required. This paper proposes a low- cost artificial landmark-based localization system for mobile robots operating indoor. It is based on Quick Response (QR) codes, which contain the absolute position of the landmark: a vision system recognizes the codes, estimates the relative position of the robot (i.e., displacement and orientation) w.r.t. the codes and, finally, calculates the absolute position of the robot by exploiting the information contained in the codes. The system has been experimentally validated for self-localization of a smart wheelchair, and experimental results confirm that navigation is possible when considering an high QR-code density, while QR-code low density conditions permit to reset the cumulative odometry error. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Designed to be transported via-helicopter and easily handled by a small team of scientists it is specially addressed to work under the shelf ice of Antarctica by exploiting the holes drilled in the ice by means of a special 350 mm auger; the shape of the vehicle reminds that of a torpedo contained in a 340 mm diameter. Highly automated, P2-ROV is designed to work in hovering in order to monitor the peculiar Platelet Ice and to collect biological samples. For this purpose it will be equipped with a mechanical arm with an embedded suction pump which permits to collect larvae and fish eggs of the species that live and breed in the Platelet Ice.

In the AUV recovery process, AUV approaches a cone-shaped dock, and the thrust performance of propeller is influenced obviously by the gap flow between AUV and dock. The purpose of this paper is to exploit the thrust performance of propeller during the underwater recovery process of AUV To achieve this purpose, numerical simulations are performed based on the CFD method. The geometric model of AUV with propeller and dock is built firstly, and the computational domain is divided into two major parts, stationary domain and moving domain, which is based on the dynamic mesh technique to simulate AUV motion and propeller rotation. The hybrid mesh are generated to discretize the computational domain space, and the simulations are conducted based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM).

Most of the reported techniques suffer from the disadvantages of large feature dimension, computational complexity of the features and complex classifiers which make implementation difficult and time consuming. In this paper we explore the utility of Fourier harmonic phase of the ECG data for MI identification. The phase response properties of the Fourier harmonics of the time and amplitude normalized lead II ECG beats from healthy and infarction records were analyzed to identify two clearly distinguishable features related to the changes in the phase distribution pattern. Use of heuristic threshold based classification with these extracted features could classify the healthy and the inferior infarction data from the PTB diagnostic ECG database with a high detection accuracy of 97.4% and sensitivity and specificity of 98.2% and 96.3% respectively. The robustness of the proposed technique was also validated with real ECG data collected using BIOPAC MP-45 data acquisition system. The results are clearly indicative of the potential of this novel feature space for MI identification. Largely reduced feature dimension, computational simplicity of the features and the use of simple classifier contributes to the implementation simplicity of the proposed technique justifying its use in portable devices. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This work studies the threats to trustworthy data transmission in RSNs posed by untrusted components within the RSN and external interfaces. We propose a novel scan pattern generation method that finds trustworthy access sequences to prevent sniffing and spoofing of transmitted data in the RSN. For insecure RSNs, for which such accesses do not exist, we present an automated transformation that improves the security and trustworthiness while preserving the accessibility to attached instruments. The area overhead is reduced based on results from trustworthy access pattern generation.

In particular, we propose a robust control scheme that is decomposed into a position and an attitude control modules, operating in a cascaded form, and does not depend on the explicit knowledge of the value of the model parameters. Exploiting the concepts and techniques of prescribed performance control, each module guarantees trajectory tracking with prescribed transient and steady-state response, despite the presence of external disturbances, such as wind gusts and ground effect phenomena. Additionally, a novel reformulation of the translational dynamics reveals a sufficient condition for closed-loop stability and allows us to extract the appropriate attitude commands straightforwardly. Moreover, the derived control algorithms are of low complexity and thus can be efficiently implemented on low-cost, aerial embedded systems of limited power and computational resources. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed control scheme is verified via extensive experimental studies using an autonomous small-scale helicopter. © 2017 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

"Shockable versus nonshockable life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias using dwt and nonlinear features of ECG signals","2017","Journal of Mechanics in Medicine and Biology","10.1142/S0219519417400048","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030855759&doi=10.1142%2fS0219519417400048&partnerID=40&md5=a27cc06960e415eae08409eea5e4d417","Shockable ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VFib) are the life-threatening conditions requiring immediate attention. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation are the significant immediate recommended treatments for these shockable arrhythmias to obtain the return of spontaneous circulation. However, accurate classification of these shockable VAs from nonshockable ones is the key step during defibrillation by automated external defibrillator (AED). Therefore, in this work, we have proposed a novel algorithm for an automated differentiation of shockable and nonshockable VAs from electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The ECG signals are segmented into 5, 8 and 10s. These segmented ECGs are subjected to four levels of discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). Various nonlinear features such as approximate entropy (Eax), signal energy (Îx), Fuzzy entropy (Efx), Kolmogorov Sinai entropy (Eksx), permutation entropy (Epx), Renyi entropy (Erx), sample entropy (Esx), Shannon entropy (Eshx), Tsallis entropy (Etx), wavelet entropy (Ewx), fractal dimension (FDx), Kolmogorov complexity (Ckx), largest Lyapunov exponent (ELLEx), recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) parameters (RQix), Hurst exponent (Hx), activity entropy (Eacx), Hjorth complexity (Hcx), Hjorth mobility (Hmx), modified multi scale entropy (Emmsyx) and higher order statistics (HOS) bispectrum (Biix) are obtained from the DWT coefficients. Later, these features are subjected to sequential forward feature selection (SFS) method and selected features are then ranked using seven ranking methods namely, Bhattacharyya distance, entropy, Fuzzy maximum relevancy and minimum redundancy (mRMR), receiver operating characteristic (ROC), Student's t-test, Wilcoxon and ReliefF. These ranked features are supplied independently into the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. Our proposed system achieved maximum accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of (i) 97.72%, 94.79% and 98.74% for 5s, (ii) 98.34%, 95.49% and 99.14% for 8s and (iii) 98.32%, 95.16% and 99.20% for 10s of ECG segments using only ten features. The integration of the proposed algorithm with ECG acquisition systems in the intensive care units (ICUs) can help the clinicians to decipher the shockable and nonshockable life-threatening arrhythmias accurately. Hence, doctors can use the CPR or AED immediately and increase the chance of survival during shockable life-threatening arrhythmia intervals. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, these regions have high scientific importance and require efficient ways of transferring research data from different missions and deployed equipment. For this purpose, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used as data mules, capable of flying over large distances and retrieving data from remote locations. Despite being a well-known concept, its performance has not been thoroughly evaluated in realistic settings. In this paper, such a solution is evaluated through a field-experiment, exploiting the obtained results to define and implement an emulator for intermittent links. This emulator was designed as a mission planning tool, where we further analyze the impact of different flight trajectories when retrieving data. Additionally, we study the overall performance of 4 well-known file-transferring protocols suitable for a UAV being used as a data mule. Our analysis shows that trajectories at higher altitudes, despite increasing distance between nodes, improves communication performance. Moreover, the obtained results demonstrate that DTN2, using the bundle protocol, outperforms FTP, Rsync, and SCP, and that all these protocols are affected by the size of the files being transferred. These results suggest that, in order for the scientific community to practically use UAVs as data mules, further studies are required, namely on how different UAV trajectories can be combined with efficient file-transferring network protocols and well organized data structures. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The possibility of accurately estimating the UUV orientation has a positive impact on it, as the most of position estimation algorithms rely on the orientation signal. Among the orientation degrees of freedom, the heading angle has the highest importance in this process. Because its determination is strongly based on the use of magnetometers, it is also the one mostly affect by environmental unpredictable disturbances. In the recent past, the authors worked on a complementary filter capable of detecting and ignoring the magnetometers samples affected by disturbances. This way the navigation system of the vehicle can always exploit a reliable orientation information. In order to allow the UUV working under strongly disturbed conditions (e.g. inspections of modern wrecks), in this paper the bases for a heading estimation strategy that could completely avoid the use of magnetometers is proposed. The only involved devices are positioning sensors (Global Positioning System - GPS on the surface or Ultra-Short BaseLine USBL system underwater) velocity sensor (Doppler Velocity Log - DVL) and gyroscopes. The results of an observability analysis are provided highlighting that the heading degree of freedom results observable except for few trajectories along which a real vehicle reasonably never travels. Experimental results are provided as a first validation of the proposed approach. MARTA AUV was controlled to complete a mission on an area free of magnetic disturbances; the outcome of the proposed algorithm is compared with the one of the onboard orientation estimation algorithm that could exploit also the magnetometers signal. The slightly difference between the two estimations is a first encouraging result towards its on-line application. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The review is motivated by the increasing use of small UAVs for inspecting critical infrastructures such as the electric utility transmission and distribution grid, which could be a target for terrorism. The paper presents a modified taxonomy to organize cyber attacks on UAVs and exploiting threats by Attack Vector and Target. It shows that, by Attack Vector, there has been one physical attack and ten remote attacks. By Target, there have been six attacks on GPS (two jamming, four spoofing), two attacks on the control communications stream (a deauthentication attack and a zero-day vulnerabilities attack), and two attacks on data communications stream (two intercepting the data feed, zero executing a video replay attack). The paper also divides and discusses the findings by large or small UAVs, over or under 25 kg, but concentrates on small UAVs. The survey concludes that UAV-related research to counter cybersecurity threats focuses on GPS Jamming and Spoofing, but ignores attacks on the controls and data communications stream. The gap in research on attacks on the data communications stream is concerning, as an operator can see a UAV flying off course due to a control stream attack but has no way of detecting a video replay attack (substitution of a video feed). © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

It is essential to detect and capture landslide changes regularly. Traditional methods for monitoring landslides are time-consuming, costly, dangerous, and the quality and quantity of the data is sometimes unable to meet the necessary requirements of geotechnical projects. This motivates the development of more automatic and efficient remote sensing approaches for landslide progression evaluation. Automatic change detection involving low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle image-based point clouds, although proven, is relatively unexplored, and little research has been done in terms of accounting for volumetric changes. In this study, a methodology for automatically deriving change displacement rates, in a horizontal direction based on comparisons between extracted landslide scarps from multiple time periods, has been developed. Compared with the iterative closest projected point (ICPP) registration method, the developed method takes full advantage of automated geometric measuring, leading to fast processing. The proposed approach easily processes a large number of images from different epochs and enables the creation of registered image-based point clouds without the use of extensive ground control point information or further processing such as interpretation and image correlation. The produced results are promising for use in the field of landslide research. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The process is referred to as dynamic soaring and there are two methods for its implementation, namely, sustainable climbing and the Rayleigh cycle. In this study, the criterion for sustainable climbing was determined, and a bio-inspired method for implementing the Rayleigh cycle in a shear wind was developed. The determined sustainable climbing criterion promises to facilitate the development of an unpowered aircraft and the choice of a more appropriate soaring environment, as was demonstrated in this study. The criterion consists of three factors, namely, the environment, aerodynamics, and wing loading. We develop an intuitive explanation of the Raleigh cycle and analyze the energy mechanics of utilizing a wind gradient in unpowered flight. The energy harvest boundary and extreme power point were determined and used to design a simple bio-inspired guidance strategy for implementing the Rayleigh cycle. The proposed strategy, which involves the tuning of a single parameter, can be easily implemented in real-time applications. In the results and discussions, the effects of each factor on climbing performance are examined and the sensitivity of the aircraft factor is discussed using five examples. Experimental MATLAB simulations of the proposed strategy and the comparison of the results with those of Gauss Pseudospectral Optimization Software confirm the feasibility of the proposed strategy. © 2017 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

By exchanging information vehicles can become aware of each other and prevent dangerous situations that can lead to crashes either by early warning drivers or by automatic vehicle control, a solution particularly appealing for self-driving cars. While research on vehicular safety mainly focuses on vehicle-to-vehicle safety, we can exploit communication to implement applications aimed at protecting vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians or cyclists. In this paper, we start by exploiting a probability framework for estimating the likelihood of collision between a vehicles approaching an intersection and a cyclist, in light of the feasibility of communication between the two. On top of this framework, we design a simple application that, under certain conditions, informs the car driver (assumed to have to yield precedence) of the possible collision. We model the reaction of the driver to the warning and analyze possible benefits and drawbacks of such an application.

There are extensive benchmarks on this topic and it has been shown to be a challenging problem when applied on real use-case scenarios. In purely image-based pedestrian detection approaches, the state-of-the-art results have been achieved with convolutional neural networks (CNN) and surprisingly few detection frameworks have been built upon multi-cue approaches. In this work, we develop a new pedestrian detector for autonomous vehicles that exploits LiDAR data, in addition to visual information. In the proposed approach, LiDAR data is utilized to generate region proposals by processing the three dimensional point cloud that it provides. These candidate regions are then further processed by a state-of-the-art CNN classifier that we have fine-tuned for pedestrian detection. We have extensively evaluated the proposed detection process on the KITTI dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed LiDAR space clustering approach provides a very efficient way of generating region proposals leading to higher recall rates and fewer misses for pedestrian detection.

The UAV equipped GPS is conducted as the detection target of networked radar. The geodetic coordinates of UAV and networked radar is measured by differential GPS positioning technology. Using the coordinate transformation, the UAV coordinates is obtained in sphere coordinate system whose origin is the radar.

However, recent research on DNNs has indicated ever-increasing concern on the robustness to adversarial examples, especially for security-critical tasks such as traffic sign identification for autonomous driving. Studies have unveiled the vulnerability of a well-trained DNN by demonstrating the ability of generating barely noticeable (to both human and machines) adversarial images that lead to misclassification. Furthermore, researchers have shown that these adversarial images are highly transferable by simply training and attacking a substitute model built upon the target model, known as a black-box attack to DNNs. Similar to the setting of training substitute models, in this paper we propose an effective black-box attack that also only has access to the input (images) and the output (confidence scores) of a targeted DNN. However, different from leveraging attack transferability from substitute models, we propose zeroth order optimization (ZOO) based attacks to directly estimate the gradients of the targeted DNN for generating adversarial examples. We use zeroth order stochastic coordinate descent along with dimension reduction, hierarchical attack and importance sampling techniques to efficiently attack black-box models. By exploiting zeroth order optimization, improved attacks to the targeted DNN can be accomplished, sparing the need for training substitute models and avoiding the loss in attack transferability. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that the proposed ZOO attack is as effective as the state-of-the-art white-box attack (e.g., Carlini and Wagner's attack) and significantly outperforms existing black-box attacks via substitute models. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Thus, there is a need to characterize GNSS signal degradations and assess the effects of interfering sources on the performance of avionics GNSS receivers and augmentation systems used for an increasing number of mission-essential and safety-critical aviation tasks (e.g., experimental flight testing, flight inspection/certification of ground-based radio navigation aids, wide area navigation and precision approach). GNSS signal deteriorations typically occur due to antenna obscuration caused by natural and man-made obstructions present in the environment (e.g., elevated terrain and tall buildings when flying at low altitude) or by the aircraft itself during manoeuvring (e.g., aircraft wings and empennage masking the on-board GNSS antenna), ionospheric scintillation, Doppler shift, multipath, jamming and spurious satellite transmissions. Anyone of these phenomena can result in partial to total loss of tracking and possible tracking errors, depending on the severity of the effect and the receiver characteristics. After designing GNSS performance threats, the various augmentation strategies adopted in the Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management and Avionics (CNS + A) context are addressed in detail. GNSS augmentation can take many forms but all strategies share the same fundamental principle of providing supplementary information whose objective is improving the performance and/or trustworthiness of the system. Hence it is of paramount importance to consider the synergies offered by different augmentation strategies including Space Based Augmentation System (SBAS), Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS), Aircraft Based Augmentation System (ABAS) and Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). Furthermore, by employing multi-GNSS constellations and multi-sensor data fusion techniques, improvements in availability and continuity can be obtained. SBAS is designed to improve GNSS system integrity and accuracy for aircraft navigation and landing, while an alternative approach to GNSS augmentation is to transmit integrity and differential correction messages from ground-based augmentation systems (GBAS). In addition to existing space and ground based augmentation systems, GNSS augmentation may take the form of additional information being provided by other on-board avionics systems, such as in ABAS. As these on-board systems normally operate via separate principles than GNSS, they are not subject to the same sources of error or interference. Using suitable data link and data processing technologies on the ground, a certified ABAS capability could be a core element of a future GNSS Space-Ground-Aircraft Augmentation Network (SGAAN). Although current augmentation systems can provide significant improvement of GNSS navigation performance, a properly designed and flight-certified SGAAN could play a key role in trusted autonomous system and cyber-physical system applications such as UAS Sense-and-Avoid (SAA). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Review","Final","Scopus"

UAS are being used in various applications ranging from remote sensing[1] to disaster response[2] to package delivery[3]. As drones rapidly fill the airspace, there are several threats that the system can encounter. These threats include mid-air collisions, loss of remote command connection, security breach of the drone's software system and critical damage to the hardware. To ensure the integrity of the drone in flight, an interconnected UAS architecture, having a fully functional system capable of responding to these situations, is required. This paper presents a system meeting these requirements. An interconnected UAS system of systems is proposed that includes systems for onboard GPS, obstacle avoidance central control and safety response. It focuses on the coordination level that the UAS systems will need to have amongst themselves. It proposes a control system to ensure effective monitoring of UAS. The UAS system architecture is comprised of eleven systems that are essential for a safe flight. In addition, the control system includes five different systems that are involved in the decision-making process. The importance and operation of these systems are discussed in detail. The proposed UAS software architecture is capable of performing autonomous self-control. It has decision making modules that can receive data from various sensors and integrate it to provide efficient route planning and data management. The software systems monitor the area surrounding the UAV to facilitate routing and decision making. The software architecture includes self-awareness to respond to situations such as adverse climatic conditions that impact the flight capabilities of the UAS. The proposed UAS system also includes hardware to monitor and update the list of obstacles in its path. This requires the UAS to be equipped with sensors for obstacle determination and a software system that accepts the inputs from these sensors, makes decisions and performs actions, promptly. An emergency response system is included to ensure that the drone will land safely in an appropriate location, if its systems are compromised. This response system is capable of deciding the severity of the situation and sends commands to the flight control system regarding the recovery steps that should be taken. The proposed system architecture incorporates cybersecurity in its design framework so that it is equipped to handle potential hackers that might try to gain access to onboard navigation controls and reroute the UAS for personal gain or another agenda. If the system senses a threat, it launches the emergency response system. The proposed UAS software architecture includes a maintenance and diagnostics system that coordinates and monitors drone activities. It performs functions ranging from monitoring the health of the hardware systems to uploading error reports to the central server. The system transmits error reports to the control unit which further processes the data to determine the source of the error and resolve the issue. In UAS systems, a computerized framework takes input from at least one sensor, and uses a pre-characterized set of guidelines to make decisions [4].

Although they can be used for the betterment of the society, they can also be used by malicious entities to conduct physical and cyber attacks to infrastructure, private/public property, and people. Even for legitimate use-cases of small UASs, air traffic management (ATM) for UASs becomes of critical importance for maintaining safe and collusion-free operation. Therefore, various ways to detect, track, and interdict potentially unauthorized drones carries critical importance for surveillance and ATM applications. In this paper, we will review techniques that rely on ambient radio frequency signals (emitted from UASs), radars, acoustic sensors, and computer vision techniques for detection of malicious UASs. We will present some early experimental and simulation results on radar-based range estimation of UASs, and receding horizon tracking of UASs. Subsequently, we will overview common techniques that are considered for interdiction of UASs. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Even the best current precise localization system based on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can not always reach this level of precision, especially in an urban environment, where the signal is disturbed by surrounding buildings and artifacts. Laser range finder and stereo vision have been successfully used for obstacle detection, mapping and localization to solve the autonomous driving problem. Unfortunately, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDARs) are very expensive sensors and stereo vision requires powerful dedicated hardware to process the cameras information. In this context, this article presents a low-cost architecture of sensors and data fusion algorithm capable of autonomous driving in narrow two-way roads. Our approach exploits a combination of a short-range visual lane marking detector and a dead reckoning system to build a long and precise perception of the lane markings in the vehicle’s backwards. This information is used to localize the vehicle in a map, that also contains the reference trajectory for autonomous driving. Experimental results show the successful application of the proposed system on a real autonomous driving situation. © 2017 by the authors.

"Common Carotid Artery Lumen Segmentation from Cardiac Cycle-Resolved Cine Fast Spin Echo Magnetic Resonance Imaging","2017","Proceedings - 30th Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images, SIBGRAPI 2017","10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2017.65","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040581255&doi=10.1109%2fSIBGRAPI.2017.65&partnerID=40&md5=07b54906a13039aeff2a2aae1ec87fbd","Atherosclerosis is a disease responsible for millions of deaths each year, primarily due to heart attack and stroke. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a non-invasive method that can be used to analyze the carotid artery and detect signs of atherosclerosis. Most MR methods acquire high contrast, static images. These methods, however, are sensitive to artifacts from cardiac motion, produce time-averaged images, and do not allow for carotid distensibility analysis. Carotid distensibility is an important, systematic measure of vascular health. Cine fast spin echo (FSE) is a new MR imaging that can obtain dynamic MR data (i.e., cardiac phase-resolved datasets). Dynamic imaging, however, comes at the cost of lower spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, making these data potentially more difficult to segment. This paper introduces a semi-automated segmentation method that segments the common carotid artery (CCA) lumen across the cardiac cycle from dynamic MR images. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first proposed technique for segmenting cardiac cycle-resolved cine FSE images. It combines a priori knowledge about the size and shape of the CCA, with the max-tree data structure, the tie-zone watershed transform (using identified internal and external markers) and supervised classification, to segment the carotid artery wall-lumen boundary. The user has to select only a seed point (centred in the carotid artery lumen). Technique performance was assessed using forty-five cine FSE data sets, each consisting of images reconstructed at sixteen temporal bins across the cardiac cycle. The automatic segmentation results were compared against the consensus of three different manual segmentation results. Our technique achieved an average Dice coefficient, sensitivity and false positive rate of 0.928±0.031 (mean ± standard deviation), 0.915 ± 0.037 and 0.056 ± 0.049, respectively. Our method achieved higher agreement versus the consensus of the three manual segmentations than the individual manual segmentations versus the consensus. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

They require end users to perform: (1) checksum comparison to detect traditional data-based man-in-the-middle (data MITM) attacks, and, optionally, (2) speaker verification to detect sophisticated voice-based man-in-the-middle (voice MITM) attacks. However, research shows that both tasks are prone to human errors making Crypto Phones highly vulnerable to MITM attacks, especially to data MITM given the prominence of these attacks. Further, human errors under benign settings undermine usability since legitimate calls would often need to be rejected. We introduce Closed Captioning Crypto Phones (CCCP), that remove the human user from the loop of checksum comparison by utilizing speech transcription. CCCP simply requires the user to announce the checksum to the other party-the system automatically transcribes the spoken checksum and performs the comparison. Automating checksum comparisons offers many key advantages over traditional designs: (1) the chances of data MITM due to human errors and ""click-through"" could be highly reduced (even eliminated); (2) longer checksums can be utilized, which increases the protocol security against data MITM; (3) users' cognitive burden is reduced due to the need to perform only a single task, thereby lowering the potential of human errors. As a main component of CCCP, we first design and implement an automated checksum comparison tool based on standard Speech to Text engines. To evaluate the security and usability benefits of CCCP, we then design and conduct an online user study that mimics a realistic VoIP scenario, and collect and transcribe a comprehensive data set spoken by a wide variety of speakers in real-life conditions. Our study results demonstrate that, by using our automated checksum comparison, CCCP can completely resist data MITM, while significantly reducing human errors in the benign case compared to the traditional approach. They also show that CCCP may help reduce the likelihood of voice MITM. Finally, we discuss how CCCP can be improved by designing specialized transcribers and carefully selected checksum dictionaries, and how it can be integrated with existing Crypto Phones to bolster their security and usability. © 2017 author(s).","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This bacterium is transmitted by Amblyomma ticks and is present in sub-Saharan Africa, islands in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean, where it represents a threat to the American mainland. Methods: An automated DNA extraction method was adapted for Amblyomma ticks and a new qPCR targeting the pCS20 region was developed to improve E. ruminantium screening capacity and diagnosis. The first step in the preparation of tick samples, before extraction, was not automated but was considerably improved by using a Tissue Lyser. The new pCS20 Sol1 qPCR and a previously published pCS20 Cow qPCR were evaluated with the OIE standard pCS20 nested PCR. Results: pCS20 Sol1 qPCR was found to be more specific than the nested PCR, with a 5-fold increase in sensitivity (3 copies/reaction vs 15 copies/reaction), was less prone to contamination and less time-consuming. As pCS20 Sol1 qPCR did not detect Rickettsia, Anasplasma and Babesia species or closely related species such as Panola Mountain Ehrlichia, E. chaffeensis and E. canis, its specificity was also better than Cow qPCR. In parallel, a tick 16S qPCR was developed for the quality control of DNA extraction that confirmed the good reproducibility of the automated extraction. The whole method, including the automated DNA extraction and pCS20 Sol1 qPCR, was shown to be sensitive, specific and highly reproducible with the same limit of detection as the combined manual DNA extraction and nested PCR, i.e. 6 copies/reaction. Finally, 96 samples can be tested in one day compared to the four days required for manual DNA extraction and nested PCR. Conclusions: The adaptation of an automated DNA extraction using a DNA/RNA viral extraction kit for tick samples and the development of a new qPCR increased the accuracy of E. ruminantium epidemiological studies, as well as the diagnostic capabilities and turn-over time for surveillance of heartwater. This new method paves the way for large-scale screening of other bacteria and viruses in ticks as well as genetic characterization of ticks and tick-pathogen coevolution studies. © 2017 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

Here, we used automated image-based tracking to characterize the exploratory (voluntary) speed of 173 invertebrates comprising 57 species across six taxonomic groups (Arachnida, Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Entognatha, Insecta, Malacostraca) and four feeding types (carnivore, detritivore, herbivore, omnivore). Across all individuals, exploratory speed (mm/s) scaled with body mass (g) following a power-law relationship with a scaling exponent of 0.19 ± 0.04 (mean ± SE) and an intercept of 14.33 ± 1.2. These parameters varied substantially with taxonomic group and feeding type. For the first time, we provide general empirically derived allometric scaling relationships of exploratory speed across broad taxonomic groups of invertebrates. As exploratory speed drives key components of species interactions, such as encounter and attack rates, or competition, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of individual movement in population and community level processes. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America","Article","Final","Scopus"

The remainder of the paper addresses a computational problem not amenable to closed-form solution; namely, the hard real-time (~57 usec) synthesis of a desired waveform through the adaptive modification of a carrier wave. This effectively increases the signal to noise ratio - ensuring better UAV communications. Here, the modulation of the primary waveform is under user control and is of strictly positive amplitude. The primary waveform induces a secondary waveform having delayed leading and trailing edges and expanded rise and fall times. There is, in general, a direct relation between the period of the primary waveform and the amplitude of the secondary waveform. The relation between the primary and secondary waveforms may be characterized by trigonometric functions or even interpolating polynomials. However, response time will be minimized where the primary waveforms are discretized and stored in the form of array-based cases. The tertiary (target) wave may be any periodic trigonometric function, but is taken to be a simple sine wave without loss of generality. The task of the adaptive program is to minimize ||s(t) - g(t)||2, where f(t) Æ g(t) and f(t) is the primary waveform at time t, g(t) is the secondary waveform at time t, and s(t) is the tertiary waveform at time t. A computationally efficient algorithm is provided for solving this task in real time. Moreover, an evolutionary program (EP) is provided for automatic case acquisition.

Session key establishment between the sensor node and the user is also required for secure communication. In this paper, we perform the security analysis of A.K.Das's user authentication scheme (given in 2015), Choi et al.'s scheme (given in 2016), and Park et al.'s scheme (given in 2016). The security analysis shows that their schemes are vulnerable to various attacks like user impersonation attack, sensor node impersonation attack and attacks based on legitimate users. Based on the cryptanalysis of these existing protocols, we propose a secure and efficient authenticated session key establishment protocol which ensures various security features and overcomes the drawbacks of existing protocols. The formal and informal security analysis indicates that the proposed protocol withstands the various security vulnerabilities involved in WSNs. The automated validation using AVISPA and Scyther tool ensures the absence of security attacks in our scheme. The logical verification using the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic confirms the correctness of the proposed protocol.

In this study, the damage of UAVs by high power electromagnetic pulse are analyzed, and the target vulnerability of UAVs under the electromagnetic pulse source is analyzed. According to the damage effect, the damage level of the high frequency electromagnetic pulse to UAVs is divided into three levels, namely the interference level, the damage level and the failure level, and the main targets of electromagnetic pulse are analyzed. The results show that the most vulnerable parts of the UAVs are the receiver and the electronic governor. Therefore, in future research and practical application, it is necessary to study the damage and destruction of the electromagnetic pulse to the receiver and the electronic governor.

It is important for the opponent to identify the tactical information about the enemy's reconnaissance radar. It has a great influence on the war. Scanning cycle of the monitoring radar is an important parameter for the counterreconnaissance of the hostile radar source in the electronic countermeasure. Since the pulse Doppler (PD) radar is one of the most widely used type in modern reconnaissance radar domains, this paper focuses on scanning cycle estimation of the reconnaissance radar (PD radar) using a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We propose an effective method to reconstruct the main-beam pattern (MBP) curve of the radar antenna based on the norm approximation algorithm, and then the reconstructed MBP curve of the radar antenna is exploited to estimate the scanning cycle of the reconnaissance radar. By hovering the UAV at the same place, the scanning cycle of the reconnaissance radar can be estimated according to the reconstructed MBP curve. In the simulation section, we check the validity and robustness of the proposed method through the performance comparison with the Cramer-Rao lower bound. © 2017 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Since their equilibrium is often threatened by human activities and high vulnerability of the coastal environment, dunes require increasing attention and specific monitoring. Located between the mainland and the sea, dunes are unique residue habitats for some plant and animal species. In particular, their vegetation is important because it has a consolidation function and promotes the vertical dune accretion. A georeferenced vegetation classification can be useful to define the advancements or erosion stage of the dune, usually based only on the geometric reconstruction. The proposed study aims to compare the classifications performed with some combinations of two of the last generation sensors and traditional image processing techniques. High spectral resolution satellite image (WorldView-2) and a multispectral orthophoto, obtained from data acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle, were used. Objects and pixel algorithms were applied and the results were compared by a statistical test. Using the same bands, the findings show that both data are suitable for monitoring the evolutionary dune status.

The effect results to inadequate services delivered by the public emergency agencies, and unnecessary traffic congestion to other road users at intersection points. In this paper we present an effective reinforced road traffic control policy that reduces the waiting time of emergency vehicles at road intersection points, and also reduce the travel time of other vehicles. The work involved simulation of traffic control at an intersection using a multi-agent system development framework (JADE) and an agent-based traffic simulator (SUMO). In order to exploit the full potential of SUMO, a third tool (TraSMAPI) was used to connect JADE and SUMO and also, to provide a higher abstraction of SUMO. In this way, the simulation is not restricted to only what SUMO can offer, but also permits us to control and manipulate the behaviour of the simulation runs. The result shows that intelligent traffic control fulfils its objectives by significantly reducing the travel time of emergency vehicles or other normal vehicles. It is shown in the paper that intelligent traffic control is at least 96% better in reducing the waiting time of emergency vehicles at intersections than nonintelligent fixed traffic control. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, most ATM Machines are prone to security risk, security breach, even though every ATM is equipped with CCTV installation. Some of security risk involves at ATM centre includes damaging ATM machine and decamping with cash, damaging CCTV camera to erase the identity of who involved in the crime, installing skimmer machine to capture debit card details and PIN number to create fake debit card, attacking ATM users and looting their valuable money withdrawn from ATM machine, murdering security guard for the purpose of looting ATM, withdrawing money by using fake ATM card. ATM crime is on the raise in the recent years due to its remote location. To enhance ATM security and to protect ATM centre form untoward incidents, new form of security framework needs to be identified.

For efficient detection of unusual activity in the ATM premises, this paper proposes a new mechanism of different window size to capture action rich frame that helps us to identify unusual activity and alert anticrime cell to avert ATM crime. This paper also proposes idea of recognizing unusual sounds such as breaking ATM machine with rod, screaming sound of customer, bursting sound of pistol within ATM centre which generates high decibels than decibels generated by normal human conversation and alert bank personal about ongoing crime that helps to catch culprit red handed.

Based on the initial concept of Barry Sharpless in 2001, the copper(I)-catalyzed azide/alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction has triggered a plethora of chemical concepts for linking molecules and building blocks under ambient conditions, forming the basis for applications in autonomous cross-linking materials. Self-healing systems on the other hand are often based on mild cross-linking chemistries that are able to react either autonomously or upon an external trigger. In the ideal case, self-healing takes place efficiently at low temperatures, independent of the substrate(s) used, by forming strong and stable networks, binding to the newly generated (cracked) interfaces to restore the original material properties. The use of the CuAAC in self-healing systems, most of all the careful design of copper-based catalysts linked to additives as well as the chemical diversity of substrates, has led to an enormous potential of applications of this singular reaction. The implementation of click-based strategies in self-healing systems therefore is highly attractive, as here chemical (and physical) concepts of molecular reactivity, molecular design, and even metal catalysis are connected to aspects of materials science. In this Account, we will show how CuAAC reactions of multivalent components can be used as a tool for self-healing materials, achieving cross-linking at low temperatures (exploiting concepts of autocatalysis or internal chelation within the bulk CuAAC and systematic optimization of the efficiency of the used Cu(I) catalysts). Encapsulation strategies to separate the click components by micro- and nanoencapsulation are required in this context. Consequently, the examples reported here describe chemical concepts to realize more efficient and faster click reactions in self-healing polymeric materials. Thus, enhanced chain diffusion in (hyper)branched polymers, autocatalysis, or internal chelation concepts enable efficient click cross-linking already at 5 °C with a simultaneously reduced amount of Cu(I) catalyst and increased reaction rates, culminating in the first reported self-healing system based on click cycloaddition reactions. Via tailor-made nanocarbon/Cu(I) catalysts we can further improve the click cross-linking reaction in view of efficiency and kinetics, leading to the generation of self-healing graphene-based epoxy nanocomposites. Additionally, we have designed special CuAAC click methods for chemical reporting and visualization systems based on the detection of ruptured capsules via a fluorogenic click reaction, which can be combined with CuAAC cross-linking reactions to obtain simultaneous stress detection and self-healing within polymeric materials. In a similar concept, we have prepared polymeric Cu(I)-biscarbene complexes to detect (mechanical) stress within self-healing polymeric materials via a triggered fluorogenic reaction, thus using a destructive force for a constructive chemical response. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

These challenges can be addressed through a flexible and agile control of DC networks, which is also coordinated, i.e., orchestrated, with the management of computing resources to improve the usage of DC resources while effectively meeting user demands. In this regard, the Software-Defined Network (SDN) paradigm can play a key role thanks to automated and multi-granular network control operations and to a more effective interworking with applications (e.g., cloud management platforms). This paper presents an SDN-based orchestrator able to coordinate the provision of both cloud and network services while jointly arranging VMs and delivery path allocations based on the current load. This approach assures a proper network resource utilization as well as the convey of VM data across the DC network with better than best-effort quality. A prototype is presented with focus on the software design and on the orchestration strategies exploiting measurement-based load estimation mechanisms. The orchestrator has been thoroughly evaluated through a comprehensive set of experiments carried out using a cloud DC testbed. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed SDN-based orchestration approach and the impact of the orchestration strategies on the DC resource utilization.

Modern hospitals are well equipped to deal with such a situation; however, an ambulance may get stuck in traffic and it may take responders time to reach locations deep within a building. Each year between 180,000 and 400,000 people die due to cardiac arrest. However, it is possible to reduce this number. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have regularly been used for remote sensing and aerial imagery collection, but the technology exists to allow the use of drones to respond to medical emergencies. To ensure that drones can reach the victim and provide medical aid, a framework for reacting to emergency circumstances, is required. This paper proposes a system-of-systems-based framework that is capable of responding to one of the most acute medical emergencies, a heart attack. The proposed architecture consists of twelve systems that work in coordination to ensure that the drone can achieve safe flight and provide medical aid. An autonomous command and control system is discussed. This system also allows manual control from a remote location to perform complex work using the robotic arm. The proposed system also includes a robotic arm that uses visual feedback to assist the individual suffering from cardiac arrest. The image recognition system uses depth image sensing techniques to locate appropriate points where defibrillator pads can be administered. Before placing defibrillator pads on the person's chest, the system has to detect if the person is suffering from ventricular fibrillation. The robotic arm system supports this by performing a pre-examination using on-board sensors. On-board software, contained within the automatic external defibrillator unit, is designed to recognize if the person is suffering from ventricular fibrillation. To support autonomous flight, the path planning system uses on-board GPS to track its movement and reach its destination. Once inside a building, the system can be guided using video imagery to ensure that it reaches the desired location. It uses visible light imagery and ultrasonic sensor data to avoid obstacles in its path. The UAV's actuation system receives information from the path planning system and the command unit and controls the drone's hardware systems, which includes motors, IMU sensors for flight stability and the robotic arm. An emergency response system is incorporated to guarantee that the drone will be able to land securely in a suitable area, if it malfunctions. This system is capable of identifying the seriousness of the failure. It sends command to the drone's control unit to perform response and recovery operations. The proposed framework also considers cybersecurity needs so that it is prepared to deal with potential attackers that may attempt to access locally available route controls and reroute the UAS to satisfy unauthorized objectives. It incorporates strong encryption for passwords and other credentials, a firewall, and a limited intrusion detection system. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Consequently, an unprecedented number of drone videos (or aerial videos) are recorded and consumed.

However, due to the rich sensor instrumentations of drones, aerial videos can be geo-tagged (e.g., GPS locations, drone rotation angles) at the acquisition time, providing an opportunity for efficient management of aerial videos by exploiting their corresponding spatial structures. Each aerial video frame can thus be represented as its spatial coverage, termed aerial Field-Of-View (aerial-FOV). This effectively converts a challenging aerial video management problem into a spatial database problem on aerial-FOVs. In this paper, we focus on efficient indexing and querying of aerial-FOVs. Unfortunately, aerial-FOVs are shaped in irregular quadrilaterals, and this renders existing spatial indexes inefficient to index aerial-FOVs. Therefore, we propose a new index structure called TetraR-tree that effectively captures the geometric property of aerial-FOVs. Based on the TetraR-tree, we develop two novel search strategies to efficiently process point and range queries on aerial-FOVs. Our experiments using both real-world and large synthetic video datasets (over 30 years’ worth of videos) demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of our proposed indexing and querying algorithms. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This effort considers the ongoing research effort regarding wind features characterization and trajectory generation. The investigation of GC methods is contextualized for long duration missions of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). These are often hampered by the platform characteristics with cost and weight stringent restrictions. Therefore, innovative ways of increasing flight duration are necessary to fulfill the safety and reliability requirements for such missions fulfilling the cost and weight constraints. Atmospheric Energy Harvesting has been studied as an alternative for flight duration enhancement. The guidance and control strategies have been focused in the dynamic soaring case, in which the trajectories require precise tracking for energy gain. This gain depends on the tracking ability of the autopilot which motivates this analysis. As a conclusion to this analysis, two methodologies are chosen as candidates for GC, one based on pure differential geometry techniques to formulate simple error equations, and the other that uses adaptive control strategies based on vector field theory to formulate error equations and a Lyapunov function ensuring asymptotic stability with complex curve shapes and wind disturbances. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Rather than focus on a particular component of the AV, like adaptive cruise control, the toolchain models the end-to-end dynamics of the AV in a formal way suitable for testing and verification. First, a domain-specific language capable of describing the scenarios that occur in the day-to-day operation of an AV is defined. The language allows the description and composition of traffic participants (e.g., other vehicles and traffic control devices), and the specification of formal correctness requirements. A scenario described in this language is an executable that can be processed by a specification-guided automated test generator (bug hunting), and by an exhaustive reachability tool. The toolchain allows the user to exploit and integrate the strengths of both testing and reachability, in a way not possible when each is run alone. Finally, given a particular execution of the scenario that violates the requirements, a visualization tool can display this counter-example and generate labeled sensor data. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on three autonomous driving scenarios drawn from a collection of 36 scenarios that account for over 95% of accidents nationwide. These case studies demonstrate robustness-guided verification heuristics to reduce analysis time, counterexample visualization for identifying controller bugs in both the discrete decision logic and low-level analog (continuous) dynamics, and identification of modeling errors (e.g., traffic behaviors) that lead to unrealistic environment behavior. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Since the first development of targeting agents from hybridoma's, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been employed to inhibit tumor growth and proliferation directly or to deliver effector molecules to tumor cells. However, the full potential of such a delivery strategy is hampered by the size of mAbs, which will obstruct the targeted delivery system to access the tumor tissue. By serendipity, a new kind of functional homodimeric antibody format was discovered in camelidae, known as heavy-chain antibodies (HCAbs). The cloning of the variable domain of HCAbs produces an attractive minimal-sized alternative for mAbs, referred to as VHH or nanobodies (Nbs). Apart from their dimensions in the single digit nanometer range, the unique characteristics of Nbs combine a high stability and solubility, low immunogenicity and excellent affinity and specificity against all possible targets including tumor markers. This stimulated the development of tumor-targeted therapeutic strategies. Some autonomous Nbs have been shown to act as antagonistic drugs, but more importantly, the targeting capacity of Nbs has been exploited to create drug delivery systems. Obviously, Nb-based targeted cancer therapy is mainly focused toward extracellular tumor markers, since the membrane barrier prevents antibodies to reach the most promising intracellular tumor markers. Potential strategies, such as lentiviral vectors and bacterial type 3 secretion system,are proposed to deliver target-specific Nbs into tumor cells and to block tumor markers intracellularly. Simultaneously, Nbs have also been employed for in vivo molecular imaging to diagnose diseased tissues and to monitor the treatment effects. Here, we review the state of the art and focus on recent developments with Nbs as targeting moieties for drug delivery systems in cancer therapy and cancer imaging. © 2017 Hu, Liu and Muyldermans.","Review","Final","Scopus"

Pedestrian detection is a highly researched topic with mature methods, but most datasets focus on common scenes of people engaged in typical walking poses on sidewalks. But performance is most crucial for dangerous scenarios, such as children playing in the street or people using bicycles/skateboards in unexpected ways. Such ""inthe-tail"" data is notoriously hard to observe, making both training and testing difficult. To analyze this problem, we have collected a novel annotated dataset of dangerous scenarios called the Precarious Pedestrian dataset. Even given a dedicated collection effort, it is relatively small by contemporary standards (∼ 1000 images). To allow for large-scale data-driven learning, we explore the use of synthetic data generated by a game engine. A significant challenge is selected the right ""priors"" or parameters for synthesis: we would like realistic data with poses and object configurations that mimic true Precarious Pedestrians. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we generate a massive amount of synthetic data and train a discriminative classifier to select a realistic subset, which we deem the Adversarial Imposters. We demonstrate that this simple pipeline allows one to synthesize realistic training data by making use of rendering/animation engines within a GAN framework. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that such data can be used to rank algorithms, suggesting that Adversarial Imposters can also be used for ""in-the-tail"" validation at test-time, a notoriously difficult challenge for real-world deployment. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

These nodules possess high economic potential as they are rich in minerals such as manganese, nickel, copper and rare earth elements. Quantification of nodule coverage is important for economic feasibility studies and planning of effective exploitation strategies. Traditional methods for nodule quantification are highly labour and time intensive as they rely on freefall box corer measurements and/or image processing of seabed photographs. Using sidescan sonar data and geotagged photographs collected from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in our region of interest at CCFZ, we propose a novel technique based on artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate PMN abundance using texture variations from sidescan sonar data. Compared to an optical camera, the sidescan sonar provides a much larger area of coverage, which in effect can drastically increase the area surveyed by an AUV in a given amount of time. Till date, this is the first known published work to elaborate on a data-driven approach in estimating PMN abundance using sidescan sonar backscatter data. Our network yielded a test accuracy of 84%, which shows that it can be used as an effective tool in estimating nodule abundance from sidescan sonar.

Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) are now used extensively in offshore and military operations for complex inspection tasks where Dynamic Positioning (DP) software is used to reduce operator workload and provide stability to the platform in-mission. Developments in sophisticated control systems for ROVs have equipped the vehicles to be able to precisely navigate dangerous and hard to reach environments. This makes them an ideal platform for Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) operations. The move by EOD operations towards man-portable platforms is placing further demand on the dynamic positioning software to provide the required control stability. Meanwhile the requirement for autonomy capabilities to execute complex aspect of the tasks continues to rise. ROV DP software must not only enable precise, hands off navigation, but to accomplish intervention tasks, it must provide the additional control and stability to the joint vehicle-manipulator system that will be interacting with the target. To move from purely inspection based activities to active intervention, the ability of the system to effectively control of manipulators is vital. While these tasks are commonplace in the commercial industry using large work class ROV's, mounting small, electric, low power, high strength manipulator arms onto smaller form factor ROVs raises research challenges around control and the modelling of the dynamics between the vehicle and arm. SeeByte has developed sophisticated coupled control algorithms to control both manipulator and ROV as one system. This control architecture has now been built upon and demonstrated, adding autonomy capabilities to complex parts of the EOD mission, allowing the vehicle to automatically search, approach, inspect and terminal home onto possible mine-like threats. This paper will present techniques to stabilize small ROV systems to carry out intervention tasks while maintaining control of the vehicle. © 2017 Marine Technology Society.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Unidentified metabolites frequently emerge in the results of association studies linking metabolite levels to, for example, clinical phenotypes. For further analyses these unknown metabolites must be identified. Current approaches utilize chemical information, such as spectral details and fragmentation characteristics to determine components of unknown metabolites. Here, we propose a systems biology model exploiting the internal correlation structure of metabolite levels in combination with existing biochemical and genetic information to characterize properties of unknown molecules. Levels of 758 metabolites (439 known, 319 unknown) in human blood samples of 2279 subjects were measured using a non-targeted metabolomics platform (LC–MS and GC–MS). We reconstructed the structure of biochemical pathways that are imprinted in these metabolomics data by building an empirical network model based on 1040 significant partial correlations between metabolites. We further added associations of these metabolites to 134 genes from genome-wide association studies as well as reactions and functional relations to genes from the public database Recon 2 to the network model. From the local neighborhood in the network, we were able to predict the pathway annotation of 180 unknown metabolites. Furthermore, we classified 100 pairs of known and unknown and 45 pairs of unknown metabolites to 21 types of reactions based on their mass differences. As a proof of concept, we then looked further into the special case of predicted dehydrogenation reactions leading us to the selection of 39 candidate molecules for 5 unknown metabolites. Finally, we could verify 2 of those candidates by applying LC–MS analyses of commercially available candidate substances. The formerly unknown metabolites X-13891 and X-13069 were shown to be 2-dodecendioic acid and 9-tetradecenoic acid, respectively. Our data-driven approach based on measured metabolite levels and genetic associations as well as information from public resources can be used alone or together with methods utilizing spectral patterns as a complementary, automated and powerful method to characterize unknown metabolites. © 2017","Article","Final","Scopus"

A prime example are the networks of financial markets which-in contrast to popular perception-are largely all-electronic and decentralized with no top-down real-time controller. This prototypical system generates complex subsecond dynamics that emerge from a decentralized network comprising heterogeneous hardware and software components, communications links, and a diverse ecology of trading algorithms that operate and compete within this all-electronics environment. Indeed, these same technological and economic drivers are likely to generate a similarly competitive all-electronic ecology in a variety of future cyberphysical domains such as e-commerce, defense and the transportation system, including the likely appearance of large numbers of autonomous vehicles on the streets of many cities. Hence there is an urgent need to deepen our understanding of stability, safety and security across a wide range of ultrafast, large, decentralized all-electronic systems-in short, society will eventually need to understand what extreme behaviors can occur, why, and what might be the impact of both intentional and unintentional system perturbations. Here we set out a framework for addressing this issue, using a generic model of heterogeneous, adaptive, autonomous components where each has a realistic limit on the amount of information and processing power available to it. We focus on the specific impact of delayed information, possibly through an accidental shift in the latency of information transmission, or an intentional attack from the outside. While much remains to be done in terms of developing formal mathematical results for this system, our preliminary results indicate the type of impact that can occur and the structure of a mathematical theory which may eventually describe it. © 2017 by the authors.

This kind of wings experience large geometric deformation in flight, and the linear structure model based on small deformation hypothesis is no longer applicable. Therefore, it is necessary to build the structure model which can simulate geometric nonlinearity. Based on the Newtonian method, the dynamic equations for the geometric non-linear structure model are derived, which can be mutually validated by and complemented with the method based on Hamilton's principle derived by Hodges. To simulate the aerodynamics of flexible wings more precisely, a model for three-dimensional unsteady aerodynamics, which can consider large deformation of the wing, is built. Based on the nonlinear structure model and the unsteady aerodynamic model, the nonlinear aeroelastic model is built through loose coupling. The precision of the aeroelastic model is verified through tests. The results show that the flutter speed of flexible wings is sensitive to the free-stream angles of attack and span-wise length. When the free-stream speeds exceed the flutter speed, the wing's vibrations are stable Limited Cycle Oscillations (LCO) rather than divergence. However, as the free-stream speeds continues increasing, the wing's vibrations converge again and the damping turned to be positive. © 2017, Press of Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.

Currently available solutions rely upon exploiting electronic signals emitted from the UAS.

We examine frequency analysis of pixel fluctuation over time to exploit the temporal frequency signature present in imagery data of UAS. This signature is present for autonomous or controlled multirotor UAS and allows for lower pixels-on-target detection. The methodology also acts as a method of assessment due to the distinct frequency signatures of UAS when examined against the standard nuisance alarms such as birds or non-UAS electronic signal emitters.

However, recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial manipulations at testing time. Specifically, suppose we have a testing example, whose label can be correctly predicted by a DNN classifier. An attacker can add a small carefully crafted noise to the testing example such that the DNN classifier predicts an incorrect label, where the crafted testing example is called adversarial example. Such attacks are called evasion attacks. Evasion attacks are one of the biggest challenges for deploying DNNs in safety and security critical applications such as self-driving cars. In this work, we develop new DNNs that are robust to stateof-the-Art evasion attacks. Our key observation is that adversarial examples are close to the classification boundary. Therefore, we propose region-based classification to be robust to adversarial examples. Specifically, for a benign/adversarial testing example, we ensemble information in a hypercube centered at the example to predict its label. In contrast, traditional classifiers are point-based classification, i.e., given a testing example, the classifier predicts its label based on the testing example alone. Our evaluation results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our region-based classification can significantly mitigate evasion attacks without sacrificing classification accuracy on benign examples. Specifically, our region-based classification achieves the same classification accuracy on testing benign examples as point-based classification, but our region-based classification is significantly more robust than point-based classification to state-of-The-Art evasion attacks.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Collision avoidance requires trajectory prediction and the performance of a collision avoidance system can be improved by extending the prediction horizon. We describe an algorithm that predicts the trajectory of a small, fixed-wing UAS using an estimate of its orientation. First, a computer vision algorithm locates specific feature points of the threat aircraft in an image. Next, the POSIT algorithm uses these feature points to estimate the pose (position and attitude) of the threat. A sequence of pose estimates is then used to predict the trajectory of the threat aircraft in order to avoid a collision. To assess the algorithm's performance, the predictions are compared with predictions based solely on position estimates for a variety of encounter scenarios. Simulation and experimental results indicate that trajectory prediction using orientation estimates provides quicker response to a change in the threat aircraft trajectory and better prediction and avoidance performance. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

For instance, through V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) and V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) communication, intelligent intersections allow more fine-grained control of vehicle crossings and significantly enhance traffic efficiency. However, the performance and safety of these VANET-based systems could be seriously impaired by communication delays and packet losses, which may be caused by network congestion or by malicious attacks that target communication timing behavior. In this paper, we quantitatively model and analyze some of the timing and security issues in transportation networks with VANET-based intelligent intersections. In particular, we demonstrate how communication delays may affect the performance and safety of a single intersection and of multiple interconnected intersections, and present our delay-tolerant intersection management protocols.

Their translational potential is, however, limited by the reduced size of mouse limbs which requires a much higher resolution to evaluate their articular cartilage compared to clinical imaging tools. In experimental models, this tissue has been predominantly assessed by time-consuming histopathology using standardized semi-quantitative scoring systems. This study aimed to develop a novel imaging method for 3-dimensional (3D) histology of mouse articular cartilage, using a robotic system—termed here “3D histocutter”—which automatically sections tissue samples and serially acquires fluorescence microscopy images of each section. Tibiae dissected from C57Bl/6 mice, either naïve or OA-induced by surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM), were imaged using the 3D histocutter by exploiting tissue autofluorescence. Accuracy of 3D imaging was validated by ex vivo contrast-enhanced micro-CT and sensitivity to lesion detection compared with conventional histology. Reconstructions of tibiae obtained from 3D histocutter serial sections showed an excellent agreement with contrast-enhanced micro-CT reconstructions. Furthermore, osteoarthritic features, including articular cartilage loss and osteophytes, were also visualized. An in-house developed software allowed to automatically evaluate articular cartilage morphology, eliminating the subjectivity associated to semi-quantitative scoring and considerably increasing analysis throughput. The novelty of this methodology is, not only the increased throughput in imaging and evaluating mouse articular cartilage morphology starting from conventionally embedded samples, but also the ability to add the third dimension to conventional histomorphometry which might be useful to improve disease assessment in the model. © 2017 The Authors Microscopy Research and Technique Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Owing to the limited bandwidth of the feedback channel, it is impractical to feed back perfect CSI or the transmit precoding (TPC) matrix to be used by the transmitter. This issue has been studied for over a decade now and it is addressed by feeding the TPC codeword index back to the transmitter. In this paper, we derive the conditions to be satisfied by the transmit and receive codebooks (TCBs and RCBs) for achieving full transmit and receive diversity gains. Furthermore, based on the conditions derived, we propose several RCBs by exploiting the properties of circulant matrices constructed with the aid of Cyclotomic polynomials. The proposed RCBs are shown to offer several benefits when employed in full-duplex (FD) spatial modulation (SM) systems, which include: 1) reduced hardware complexity of the self-interference (SI) cancellation circuitry, 2) robustness to SI, 3) maintain the diversity gain in the face of strong line-of-sight (LoS) channels. Furthermore, we study the performance of the proposed RCBs in an emerging drone communication scenario where several drones act as FD relays. Our simulation results show that the proposed RCBs indeed do attain the diversity gains predicted by our theoretical results. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Most of the MUAV-based applications require time-limited access to the spectrum to complete data transmission due to limited battery capacity of the flying units. These characteristics are the origin of two challenges in MUAV-based communications: 1) efficient-energy management and 2) opportunistic spectrum access. This paper proposes an energy-efficient solution to minimize the MUAV's flying and communication energies while integrating cognitive radio technology. A non-convex optimization problem exploiting the mobility of MUAVs is developed for the underlay operating mode where the data rate threshold of the spectrum's owner has to be respected. The objective is to determine a joint optimized 3-D location and transmit power control solution by which the secondary MUAV can complete its transmission. A deterministic algorithm based on the Weber formulation is proposed to solve the optimization problem. The performances of the deterministic approach are compared to those of a meta-heuristic algorithm, namely particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). Selected numerical results illustrate the behavior of the MUAV versus various system parameters. It is shown that the proposed solution achieves very close results to those of the PSO in spite of their different conceptional constructions. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Design Observational cross-sectional study. Setting Private practices and a university clinic in Germany in 2012. Participants 649 outpatients from private practices and 2158 outpatients from 10 departments of a university clinic. Outcome measures Completion of AD, familiarity with AD, sources of information about AD (consultation), prior experiences (with own life-threatening disease and family members in need of care), motives in favour of or against completion of AD, sociodemographic data. Results Determinants of completion of AD did not differ between outpatients from private practices versus university clinic outpatients. Prior experience with severe disease led to a significantly higher rate of completion of AD (33%/36% with vs 24%/24% without prior experience). Participants with completion of AD had more often received legal than medical consultation before completion, but participants without completion of AD are rather aiming for medical consultation. The motives in favour of or against completion of AD indicated inconsistent patterns. Conclusions Determinants of completion of AD are comparable in outpatients from private practices and outpatients from a university clinic. Generalisations from university clinic samples towards a broader context thus seem to be legitimate. Only one-third of patients with prior experience with own life-threatening diseases or family members in need of care had completed an AD as expression of their autonomous volition. The participants' motives for or against completion of AD indicate that ADs are considered a kind of negative autonomy' as instruments to prevent particular forms of therapy. Interactive, repeated and situation-based AD discussions might reach a higher percentage of patients and concurrently enable personal volitions and thereby strengthen individual positive autonomy'. © Article author(s) 2017.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Since 2014, several innovative projects have been developed and implemented in the region to demonstrate and train indigenous communities in the use of small drones for territorial mapping and monitoring.

However, the analysis and planning of this maneuver have received a little attention in the literature so far. In this work, we decompose the cable-suspended load lifting into three simpler discrete states or modes: Setup, Pull, and Raise. Each of these states represents the dynamics of the quadrotor-load system at particular regimes during the maneuver. Furthermore, we define a hybrid system based on these states and show that it is a differentially-flat hybrid system. Exploiting this property, we generate a trajectory by using a series of waypoints associated with each mode.

The mathematic model of coalition formation is built on basis of the minimum attacking time and the minimum coalition size with satisfying resources and simultaneous strikes requirements. A communication protocol based on maximum number of hops is developed to determine the potential coalition members in dynamic network. A multistage sub-optimal coalition formation algorithm (MSOCFA) with polynomial time is established. The performances of MSOCFA and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms are compared in terms of complexity, mission performance and computational time. A complex scenario is deployed to illustrate how the coalitions are formed and validate the feasibility of the MSOCFA. The effect of communication constraints (hop delay and max-hops) on mission performance is studied. The results show that it is beneficial to determine potential coalition members in a wide and deep range over the network in the presence of less delay.

In this paper, we propose a system structure composed of a central agent and three layers: unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) layer, multi-robot layer and sensor network layer. The UAVs act as moving sensors and conveyors in the air. They provide the overall rough monitoring data from the air and transport robots to the emergency occurring places. The robots on the ground are responsible for obtaining detailed monitoring data and dealing with the emergencies. The sensor networks keep monitoring the environment and assist robots and UAVs in the range to complete their tasks.

Since UAVs extensively utilize autonomous behavior, it is important to develop an autopilot system that is robust to potential cyber-attack. In this work, we present a biometric system to encrypt communication between a UAV and a computerized base station. This is accomplished by generating a key derived from the Beta component of a user's EEG. When communication with a UAV is attacked, a safety mechanism directs the UAV to a safe 'home' location.

We propose a rendezvous control strategy, which divides the rendezvous process into two parts: The loose formation rendezvous and the close formation rendezvous. In the first stage, UAVs are supposed to reach the specific target locations simultaneously and form a loose formation. A distributed control strategy based on first-order consensus algorithm is presented to achieve this goal. Then the second stage is designed based on the second-order consensus algorithm to complete the transition from the loose formation to the close formation. This process needs the speeds and heading angles of UAVs to reach an agreement. Besides, control algorithms with a virtual leader are proposed, by which the formation states can reach a specific value. Finally, simulation results show that the control algorithms are capable of realizing the mission rendezvous of multi-UAV and the consistence of UAVs' final states, which verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the designed control strategy. © 2017, Editorial Department of Transactions of NUAA.

The objective of this study was to estimate the range of injury risks to humans due to UAS impact. Three commercially-available UAS models that varied in mass (1.2–11 kg) were evaluated to estimate the range of risk associated with UAS-human interaction. Live flight and falling impact tests were conducted using an instrumented Hybrid III test dummy. On average, live flight tests were observed to be less severe than falling impact tests. The maximum risk of AIS 3+ injury associated with live flight tests was 11.6%, while several falling impact tests estimated risks exceeding 50%. Risk of injury was observed to increase with increasing UAS mass, and the larger models tested are not safe for operations over people in their current form. However, there is likely a subset of smaller UAS models that are safe to operate over people. Further, designs which redirect the UAS away from the head or deform upon impact transfer less energy and generate lower risk. These data represent a necessary impact testing foundation for future UAS regulations on operations over people. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

Intentional sources include weapons of mass destruction, and they can inflict serious amount of damage. CBRN non-intentional sources can go from disease outbreaks or even incidents, such as a nuclear accident. The interest for unmanned vehicles is growing more and more, either in military or civilian applications. In this scenario, they can be applied, especially Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The response to CBRN releases should follow several steps, such as reconnaissance of the affected area, detection of the agent, sampling, decontamination, victim screening, medical evacuation, identification of the type of agent and medical treatment. Therefore, UAVs can be an important asset in this scenario, as they bring many advantages, such as the access to inhospitable or inaccessible spaces, incorporation of sensors that can be used to identify the agent, and many other factors that increase the speed of the task, reducing at the same time the risk to personnel.

Specifically, the work is focused on the effectiveness of the Kestrel simulation tools in replicating the aerodynamic coefficient data from wind tunnel experiments of a generic lambda wing configuration with four trailing edge control surfaces. Simulation conditions correspond to the angles of attack in range of −5∘ to 10∘ at assumed cruise Mach number of 0.7. These simulations include a clean configuration with no control surface deflection and when inboard/outboard control surfaces are deflected −10∘, −5∘, 5∘, and 10∘. Single and overset grids are used to simulate the control surface deflections. Predicted aerodynamic data are collected in form of look-up tables and are run in a Matlab/Simulink program to determine stability and control properties of the vehicle. The vehicle stability and control characteristics are then compared with the results of running experimental coefficient values through the same program. The results show that numerical predictions of the test case considered depend heavily on the geometry details and numerical setup, e.g. turbulence modeling, grid refinement, integration scheme, time step, etc. and therefore do not match experimental data at all tested conditions. In addition, the stability and control investigation of the vehicle using these data confirms that the differences between simulations and measurements could lead to significant changes in the evaluation of vehicle's stability and control characteristics. The simulation predictions of this work, therefore, cannot fully replace the need for experiments to determine the vehicle's stability and control, however they help to provide insight into flow physics and to direct/make best use of wind tunnel experiments. © 2017","Article","Final","Scopus"

Due to the openness and mobility of such networks, even without knowing the context of the exchanged data or linking traffic to the identities of involved sensors, criminals are able to gain useful information about the severe conditions of patients and carry effective undetectable physical attacks. Therefore, confidentiality and mutual authentication services are essential for WBANs, and the transmission must be anonymous and unlinkable as well. Given the limitations of the resources available for these sensors, a lightweight anonymous mutual authentication and key agreement scheme for centralized two-hop WBANs is proposed in this paper, which allows sensor nodes attached to the patient's body to authenticate with the local server/hub node and establish a session key in an anonymous and unlinkable manner. The security of our scheme is proved by rigorous formal proof using BAN logic and also through informal analysis. Besides, the security of our scheme is evaluated by using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) as well.

It is optimized to minimize the average altitude avoiding detection by enemy radars and to minimize fuel consumption improving range. The software developed is tested on four different 3D terrains.

We indicate that any IoS-based application strongly requires a composition framework that supports for the automation of all the phases of the composition life cycle, from requirements derivation, to synthesis, deployment and execution. Our solution to this ambitious problem is an AI planning-based composition framework that features abstract composition requirements and context-awareness. In the proposed approach most human-dependent tasks can be accomplished at design time and the few human intervention required at run time do not affect the system execution.

Less focus is put into how to ensure that this transition happens in a safe way that we can put trust in. The verification of the extreme dependability requirements connected to safety is expected to be one of the largest challenges to overcome in the commercialization of autonomous vehicles. Using traditional statistical methods to validate complete vehicle safety would require the vehicle to cover extreme distances to show that collisions occur rare enough. However, recent research has shown the possibility of using near-collisions in order to estimate the frequency of actual collisions using Extreme Value Theory. To use this method, there is a need for a measure related to the closeness of a collision. This paper shows that the choice of this threat measure has a significant impact on the inferences drawn from the data. With the right measure, this method can be used to validate the safety of a vehicle.

As vehicles typically afford limited processing resources, proposed solutions are rule-based or lightweight machine learning techniques. We argue that this limitation can be lifted with computational offloading commonly used for resource-constrained mobile devices. The increased processing resources available in this manner allow access to more advanced techniques. Using as case study a small four-wheel robotic land vehicle, we demonstrate the practicality and benefits of offloading the continuous task of intrusion detection that is based on deep learning. This approach achieves high accuracy much more consistently than with standard machine learning techniques and is not limited to a single type of attack or the in-vehicle CAN bus as previous work. As input, it uses data captured in real-time that relate to both cyber and physical processes, which it feeds as time series data to a neural network architecture. We use both a deep multilayer perceptron and recurrent neural network architecture, with the latter benefitting from a long-short term memory hidden layer, which proves very useful for learning the temporal context of different attacks. We employ denial of service, command injection and malware as examples of cyber attacks that are meaningful for a robotic vehicle. The practicality of computation offloading depends on the resources afforded onboard and remotely, and the reliability of the communication means between them. Using detection latency as the criterion, we have developed a mathematical model to determine when computation offloading is beneficial given parameters related to the operation of the network and the processing demands of the deep learning model. The more reliable the network and the greater the processing demands, the greater the reduction in detection latency achieved through offloading. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Background: Discourses of ageing readily construct people in residential aged care as postsexual, vulnerable and at risk of sexual exploitation, and therefore, expressions of intimacy and sexuality may be responded to as deviant and inherently risky. Staff may manage decision-making tacitly, without recourse to policies and education. Design: The proof-of-concept study used a discursive methodology, identifying discourses that shape diverse meanings of intimacy, sexuality and ageing. Data analysis involved thematic analysis. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four participants in 2015 as part of a mixed-methods study. This article reports on the qualitative data. Results: Four themes were identified in the data analysis: mediated intimate relationships and everyday ethics; self-referential morality; knowing the person then and now; and juggling ethical priorities. Data indicated that participants used their personal moral compass to inform their decision-making, without any related policies and applied ethics and communication education. As a result, staff described moral uncertainty and moral distress. Staff indicated that there were tensions in terms of the role of proxy decision-makers, as there were situations where staff believed they were more aware of residents’ current wishes and cognitive capabilities than family members. Conclusions: Staff, families and residents routinely address intimacy and sexuality in aged care. Ethically informed education and policies may enhance the role of staff as advocates, ensuring older people living in RAC are as at home and autonomous as possible. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Our method uses a coarse estimate of the scene geometry to plan camera trajectories that: (1) cover the scene as thoroughly as possible; (2) encourage observations of scene geometry from a diverse set of viewing angles; (3) avoid obstacles; and (4) respect a user-specified flight time budget. Our method relies on a mathematical model of scene coverage that exhibits an intuitive diminishing returns property known as submodularity. We leverage this property extensively to design a trajectory planning algorithm that reasons globally about the non-additive coverage reward obtained across a trajectory, jointly with the cost of traveling between views.

However, conventional vision-based approaches have several limitations due to full image scanning, always-on operation, various different types of traffic lights, and complex driving environments. In particular, it might be impossible to recognize a relevant traffic light among multiple traffic lights at multiple intersections. To overcome such limitations, we propose an effective architecture that integrates a vision system with an accurate positioning system and an extended digital map. The recognition process is divided into four stages and we suggest an extended methodology for each stage. These stages are: ROI generation, detection, classification, and tracking. The 3D positions of traffic lights and slope information obtained from an extended digital map enable ROIs to be generated accurately, even on slanted roads, while independent design and implementation of individual recognition modules for detection and classification allow for selection according to the type of traffic light face. Such a modular architecture gives the system simplicity, flexibility, and maintainable algorithms. In addition, adaptive tracking that exploits the distance to traffic lights allows for seamless state estimation through smooth data association when measurements change from long to short ranges. Evaluation of the proposed system occurred at six test sites and utilized two different types of traffic lights, seven states, sloped roads, and various environmental complexities. The experimental results show that the proposed system can recognize traffic lights with 98.68% precision, 92.73% recall, and 95.52% accuracy in the 10.02–81.21 m range. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an intelligent device that relies on information communication and flight control systems to achieve autonomous flight. Consequently, its security is extremely important. This study proposes a new state estimation method that uses innovation sequences based on an extended Kalman filter for the detection of data attacks on a UAV. Our method can identify data attacks on tensors and control commands. First, a cyber-physical system model for a UAV is established, and the state estimation algorithm and data attack model are introduced. Then, a scalar detection statistic is constructed for data attack detection using innovation sequences, and the minus infinity norm method is introduced to reduce the false detection of data attacks while the aircraft is being maneuvered. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed detection method can effectively detect various threat patterns under a variety of circumstances for unmanned control systems. © 2017, Editorial Department of Control Theory & Applications South China University of Technology.

Current image acquisition techniques are able to resolve those tiling patterns to allow quantitative analyses. The resulting image data, however, may contain an enormous number of elements. This renders manual image analysis infeasible, in particular when statistical analysis is to be conducted, requiring a larger number of image data to be analyzed. As a consequence, the analysis process needs to be automated to a large degree. In this paper, we describe a multi-step image segmentation pipeline for the automated segmentation of the calcified cartilage into individual tesserae from computed tomography images of skeletal elements of stingrays. Methods: Besides applying state-of-the-art algorithms like anisotropic diffusion smoothing, local thresholding for foreground segmentation, distance map calculation, and hierarchical watershed, we exploit a graph-based representation for fast correction of the segmentation. In addition, we propose a new distance map that is computed only in the plane that locally best approximates the calcified cartilage. This distance map drastically improves the separation of individual tesserae. We apply our segmentation pipeline to hyomandibulae from three individuals of the round stingray (Urobatis halleri), varying both in age and size. Results: Each of the hyomandibula datasets contains approximately 3000 tesserae. To evaluate the quality of the automated segmentation, four expert users manually generated ground truth segmentations of small parts of one hyomandibula. These ground truth segmentations allowed us to compare the segmentation quality w.r.t. individual tesserae. Additionally, to investigate the segmentation quality of whole skeletal elements, landmarks were manually placed on all tesserae and their positions were then compared to the segmented tesserae. With the proposed segmentation pipeline, we sped up the processing of a single skeletal element from days or weeks to a few hours. © 2017 Knotel et al.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Due to the limited capability of any sensor perception system, it is highly desirable that an autonomous driving vehicle could use not only information from onboard sensors (say, radar/camera/lidar) but also from remote (network) information via inter-vehicle communication systems. The collaborative information from cooperative/non-cooperative remote vehicles (along with the onboard sensor data) could substantially improve the vehicle decision making process and push autonomous driving to be safer and more reliable. Inter-vehicle communication technologies are at the stage of development for market introduction, after years of research and standardization. In this paper, we setup a dedicated short range communication (DSRC) system to provide a low-latency inter-vehicle wireless communication channel. The task is to build a record linkage between the onboard sensor data and the corresponding DSRC-transmitted remote vehicle information when both sets belong to the same object, for the purpose of enhancing host vehicle environment perceiving capability and reliability. This is a typical data association problem. The challenges mainly lie in the inherent uncertain nature of the observation data and the practical issues that information often suffers from delays and drops. We propose a track-based association approach using an interacting multiple model estimator with a sequential multiple hypothesis test (denoted as IMM-SMHT) as an ubiquitous solution to handle different situations in complicated driving scenarios. To fully exploit the potential of such a system, only position information (from the DSRC channel and onboard radar system) is used for the object matching purpose-we try to use the least amount of information to achieve a high association accuracy; additional information can be used but not currently considered. We aim to provide a real world solution, and therefore, a prototype vehicle system is built with practical consideration on market availability, cost, and sensor limitations. We design meaningful use cases for creating functionality modules from a systematic point of view. The inter-vehicle information fusion system based on the track fusion approach using the IMM-SMHT is tested in real traffic on the U.S. roads and shows promising object matching performance of significant practical feasibility. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, conventional control methods using joysticks prohibit novices from getting used to maneuvering quadrotors in short time. In this paper, we suggest the use of a wearable device, such as a smart watch, as a new remote-controller for a quadrotor. The user's command is recognized as gestures using the 9-DoF inertial measurement unit (IMU) of a wearable device through a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. Our implementation also makes it possible to align the heading of a quadrotor with the heading of the user. Our implementation allows nine different gestures and the trained RNN is used for real-time gesture recognition for controlling a micro quadrotor. The proposed system exploits available sensors in a wearable device and a quadrotor as much as possible to make the gesture-based control intuitive.

In the era of precision medicine and with the advent of powerful imaging and proteomics technologies, there is an opportunity to better understand drug resistance by exploiting these techniques to provide new knowledge on drug- target interactions. Here, we contribute to this endeavor by reporting on the development of an 18F-labeled carboplatin derivative (18F-FCP) that has the potential to image drug uptake and retention, including intratumoral distribution, by PET. Methods: Fluorinated carboplatin (19F-FCP) was synthesized using 19F-labeled 2-(5-fluoro-pentyl)-2-methyl malonic acid (19F-FPMA) as the labeling agent to coordinate with the cisplatin-aqua complex. It was then used to treat cell lines and compared with cisplatin and carboplatin at different concentrations. Manual radiosynthesis and characterization of 18F-FCP were performed using 18F-FPMA for coordination with the cisplatin-aqua complex. Automated radiosynthesis of 18F-FCP was optimized on the basis of manual synthesis procedures. The stability of 18F-FCP was verified using high-performance liquid chromatography. 18F-FCP was evaluated using ex vivo biodistribution and in vivo PET imaging in non-tumor-bearing animals as well as in KB-3-1 and COLO-205 tumor xenograft-bearing nude mice. Results: In vitro cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that 19F-FCP has an antitumor activity profile similar to that of the parent drug carboplatin. In vivo plasma and urine stability analysis showed intact 18F-FCP at 24 h after injection. PET imaging and biodistribution studies showed fast clearance from blood and major accumulation in the kidneys, indicating substantial renal clearance of 18F-FCP. Using 18F-FCP PET, we could image and identify the intratumor drug profile. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that 19F-FCP, like carboplatin, retains antitumor activity in various cell lines. 18F-FCP could be a useful imaging tool for measuring the intratumor drug distribution. This strategy of using a new therapeutic carboplatin derivative to quantify and track platinum drugs in tumors using PET has the potential to translate into a clinically useful imaging tool for individual patients.

Although the applications of UAS in commercial industries are virtually endless, there are many issues regarding their operations that need to be considered before these valuable pieces of equipment are allowed for widespread civil use. Currently, UAS operations in the public domain are guided and controlled by the FAA Part 107 rules after overwhelming public pressure caused by the earlier 333 exemption. In order to approach such larger issues, this paper will exploit the use of value models, which will help to quantify how the different environmental and operational scenarios play a role in UAS operations based on the task being performed. The primary aim of this research is to use the attributes from key factors of the UAS such as the autonomy levels (AL) and technology readiness levels (TRL) along with their operating scenario factors, such as the environmental complexity and task complexity, based on the operating environment in which a UAS performs its task. To analyze the performance of autonomous UAS in different operational scenarios, the physical characteristics and class of a UAS may be linked to its AL and TRL. Using these parameters, the risks faced by the UAS in a particular mission are quantified and a value is assigned to the abstract entities involved. Although there are many critical questions with respect to good practices to be followed by UAS operators in order to obtain valuable data and information on the structures being scanned and monitored, there are many other challenges with regards to large scale operations of UAS such as the ethical, legal and societal implications that have to be addressed. © 2017 by the authors.

The modeling uncertainties of the investigated AUV are composed of inaccurate hydrodynamic coefficients and unknown environmental disturbances. For this uncertain system, a nonlinear control law integrating line-of-sight (LOS) guidance with fuzzy sliding mode control (FSMC) algorithm is designed to guarantee global κ -exponentially convergence of path following errors. The LOS guidance in the Serret-Frenet frame is adopted to guide the under-actuated AUV to move towards the curved variable-depth path. The sliding mode control algorithm ensures the stability and the robustness of the designed control law in the presence of multiple uncertainties. The fuzzy logic algorithm is integrated to adjust sliding mode gain in order to weaken chattering. In addition, the angle of attack is considered in the design of dynamics control law to ensure that the under-actuated AUV follows the predefined path with a given resultant speed.

In particular, a novel framework for optimizing the performance of such UAV-based wireless systems in terms of the average number of bits (data service) transmitted to users as well as the UAVs' hover duration (i.e., flight time) is proposed. In the considered model, UAVs hover over a given geographical area to serve ground users that are distributed within the area based on an arbitrary spatial distribution function. In this case, two practical scenarios are considered. In the first scenario, based on the maximum possible hover times of UAVs, the average data service delivered to the users under a fair resource allocation scheme is maximized by finding the optimal cell partitions associated to the UAVs. Using the powerful mathematical framework of optimal transport theory, this cell partitioning problem is proved to be equivalent to a convex optimization problem. Subsequently, a gradient-based algorithm is proposed for optimally partitioning the geographical area based on the users' distribution, hover times, and locations of the UAVs. In the second scenario, given the load requirements of ground users, the minimum average hover time that the UAVs need for completely servicing their ground users is derived. To this end, first, an optimal bandwidth allocation scheme for serving the users is proposed. Then, given this optimal bandwidth allocation, optimal cell partitions associated with the UAVs are derived by exploiting the optimal transport theory. Simulation results show that our proposed cell partitioning approach leads to a significantly higher fairness among the users compared with the classical weighted Voronoi diagram. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the average hover time of the UAVs can be reduced by 64% by adopting the proposed optimal bandwidth allocation scheme as well as the optimal cell partitioning approach. In addition, our results reveal an inherent tradeoff between the hover time of UAVs and bandwidth efficiency while serving the ground users. © 2017 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To alleviate the difficulties being experienced by operators and pilots, researchers are focusing on the lack of lift and are trying to enhance lift by improving rotor airfoil. In this study, with the objective of enhancing the rotor performance of agricultural unmanned helicopters, the performance of basic airfoils was evaluated in a wind tunnel and via computational fluid dynamics simulation. The lift and power characteristics of rotor blades were also evaluated. As airfoil design steps to improve the lift of unmanned helicopter, the characteristics of lift, drag, and power were analyzed via wind tunnel tests for the 400 mm section models of two airfoils, specifically a thick airfoil (V1505A) with blunt nose and a thin airfoil (V2008B) with drooping nose. The V1505A airfoil is appropriate for the inboard region, which requires stable aerodynamics at a high angle of attack. On the other hand, the V2008B airfoil is ideal for the outboard region of the rotor because it has a relatively high dynamic efficiency.

However, cylindrical designs are not required for non-pressurized enclosures. Non-cylindrical designs may provide benefits to developers including allowing a wider variety of materials for construction, greater separation between instruments or equipment, and a greater separation between the center of gravity and the center of buoyancy, which will enhance stability. The work described here proposes a bio-inspired design where novel materials are used in construction and the benefits of a non-cylindrical shape are exploited. This novel design was used to produce a human-powered submersible (Trigonus) for the 14th International Submarine Races (ISR). The design was inspired by the boxfishes (Teleostei: Ostraciidae), which have been studied extensively for their hydrodynamic properties. This family of fishes have been reported to have low-drag coefficients and enhanced stability [1 but see 2] and have inspired the design of the Mercedes-Benz Bionic concept car [3]. Additionally, the fish have relatively flat sides, which can be replicated without complicated fabrication or materials, enabling simple production with inexpensive materials. The specific species used for the design described here is the Buffalo trunkfish (Lactophrys trigonus) which has a triangular cross-section with two ventral keels and one dorsal keel. Trigonus is a human powered submersible that consists of a central frame for a modular component system with a separate hull designed to provide relatively low-drag and improved stability. The hull surrounds the frame and is attached at the ends. The hull is constructed using a novel technique where pieces of corrugated plastic are stitched together to form a triangular monocoque hull. The triangular shape of the hull mimics Lactophrys trigonus in attempt to exploit the fish's low-drag high-stability hydrodynamic properties. The monocoque constructions provides the necessary stiffness to resist deformation when underway. Preliminary testing was conducted to evaluate the performance of the submersible.

These systems have been used extensively in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and will continue to be equally relevant - if not more so - as the United States' strategic focus shifts towards the Asia-Pacific region and the high-end warfare this strategy requires. The Department of Defense's vision for unmanned systems is to integrate these systems into the Joint force for a number of reasons, but especially to reduce the risk to human life in high threat areas, to deliver persistent surveillance over areas of interest, and to provide options to warfighters that derive from the inherent advantages of unmanned technologies - especially their ability to operate autonomously. The U.S. Navy has been on the forefront of UxS development. The 28th CNO Strategic Studies Group (SSG) spent one year examining this issue, and its report spurred increased interest in - and emphasis on - unmanned systems Navy-wide. Leveraging the SSG's work, recent Navy focus has emphasized the need to enhance UxS command and control (C2) capabilities to allow one sailor to control multiple systems in an attempt to lower Total Ownership Costs (TOC) of unmanned systems. This link between increased autonomy and decreased TOC has become an important theme in Navy UxS development. One of the most pressing challenges for the DoD is to reduce the prohibitively burdensome manpower requirements currently necessary to operate unmanned systems. Military manpower makes up the largest part of the total ownership cost of systems across all the Services. But how expensive is military manpower? To better understand this compelling need to reduce these manpower requirements, it is important to understand the costs of manpower to the U.S. military writ large. With the prospect of future flat or declining military budgets, the rapidly rising costs of military manpower, and the increased DoD emphasis on total ownership costs, the mandate to move beyond the 'many operators, one-joystick, one-vehicle' paradigm for UxS that has existed during the past decades for most unmanned systems is clear and compelling. But this drive for autonomy begs the question as to what this imperative to increase autonomy comports and what, if any, downside occurs if we push UxS autonomy too far. Is there an unacceptable 'dark side' to too much autonomy? There are concerns regarding the extant of autonomy military systems ought to have. Unless or until these concerns are addressed, these systems may never reach their full potential. While we accept advances in other aspects of UxS improvements such as propulsion, payload, stealth, speed, endurance and other attributes, we are still coming to grips with how much autonomy is enough and how much may be too much. This is arguably the most important issue we need to address with unmanned systems over the next decade. Unmanned systems become more autonomous in direct proportion to their ability to sense the environment and adapt to it. This capability enables unmanned systems to achieve enhanced speed in decision making and allows friendly forces to act within an adversary's OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act) loop. But while we need unmanned systems to operate inside the enemy's OODA loop, are we ready for them to operate without our decision-making, to operate inside our OODA loops? The Defense Science Board report, The Role of Autonomy in DoD Systems, put it this way: Instead of viewing autonomy as an intrinsic property of unmanned systems in isolation, the design and operation of unmanned systems needs to be considered in terms of human-systems collaboration. A key challenge facing unmanned systems developers is the move from a hardware-oriented, vehicle-centric development and acquisition process to one that emphasizes the primacy of software in creating autonomy. Unless or until these issues are addressed, the full potential naval unmanned systems may never be realized. © 2017 Marine Technology Society.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To exploit the excessive energy, energy harvesting at user terminals is a viable option. Unfortunately, the exact gain brought by wireless power transfer (WPT) in two-way communication is currently unknown. To fill this gap, in this paper, the achievable rate region of wirelessly powered two-way communication with a fixed relay is derived. Not only this newly established result is shown to enclose the existing achievable rate region of two-way relay channel without energy harvesting but also the gain is precisely quantified. On the other hand, it is well-known that a major obstacle to WPT is the path-loss. By endowing the relay with mobility, the distances between the relay and users can be varied, thus providing a potential solution to combat pathloss at the expense of energy for transmission. To characterize the consequence brought by such a scheme, a pair of inner and outer bounds to the achievable rate region of wirelessly powered two-way communication under a mobile relay is further derived. By comparing the exact achievable rate region for the fixed relay case and the achievable rate bounds for the mobile relay case, it is possible to quantify the relative advantage of spending energy on moving versus on transmission in wirelessly powered two-way communication. © 2017 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The multiserver architecture enables the expedient authentication of subscribers on an insecure channel for the delivery of services. The users rely on a single registration of a trusted third party for the procurement of services from various servers. Recently, Chen and Lee, Moon et al, and Wang et al presented multiserver key agreement schemes that are found to be vulnerable to many attacks according to our analysis. The Chen and Lee scheme was found susceptible to impersonation attack, trace attack, stolen smart card attack exposing session key, key-compromise impersonation attack, and inefficient password modification. The Moon et al is susceptible to stolen card attack leading to further attacks, ie, identity guessing, key-compromise impersonation attack, user impersonation attack, and session keys disclosure, while Wang et al is also found to be prone to trace attack, session-specific temporary information attack, key-compromise information attack, and privileged insider attack leading to session key disclosure and user impersonation attacks. We propose an improved protocol countering the indicated weaknesses of these schemes in an equivalent cost. Our scheme demonstrates automated and security analysis on the basis of Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic and also presents the performance evaluation for related schemes.

In many areas of application like Industry 4.0 or fully automated parking, additional external sensors are available as well as pre-existing knowledge about the general building structure. This information is of significant advantage, especially in situations where the perceptive field of the mobile platform is occluded. One method to gain the required information is the probabilistic concept of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, most existing approaches generally lack the possibility to incorporate preexisting and external information. In this paper, a solution to the SLAM problem based on a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter is adopted to provide efficient means for exploiting such data. We present an approach that directly incorporates environment knowledge using a context-aware environment model, while establishing reference to a global coordinate frame allowing for a straight-forward fusion with external information sources. The evaluation is performed on real-world data obtained by a mobile platform. The qualitative analysis shows significant improvement in map quality and robustness regarding short sensor outages or reduced perception rates. Establishing a uniform reference frame and reusing data, the proposed approach clearly extends the functional range of SLAM, demonstrating substantial advantages over existing methods. © 2017 Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems - ICROS.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The proposed algorithm uses an extended Kalman filter to construct robust residuals in the presence of noise, and then uses a parametric statistical tool to identify cyberattacks. The parametric statistical tool is based on the residuals constructed by the measurement history rather than one measurement at a time in the properties of discrete-time signals and dynamic systems. This approach allows the proposed multi-sensor integration algorithm to provide quick detection and low false alarm rates for applications in dynamic systems. An example of INS/GNSS integration of autonomous navigation systems is presented to validate the proposed algorithm by using a software-in-the-loop simulation. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

One of the key parameters for a safe automated driving assistance system is precise localization of the self and surrounding vehicles. Our previous work demonstrated the use of Symmetric Measurement Equations (SME) in a Factor Graph framework and exploited the use of sensor located outside the vehicle. In this paper we present a new approach which not only performs above mentioned cooperative vehicle infrastructure localization but also uses Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC). This work goes further in the direction of a complete V2X solution not only involving the infrastructure sensor but also the neighbouring vehicles. DSRC has been increasingly incorporated in all the the modern vehicles. Better state estimation is achieved by formulating the range information from DSRC as a new DSRC Range Factor in the Factor Graph. Simulations indicate better performance over the previously proposed approach of only using SME in the Factor Graph, thereby progressing a step further towards safe automated driving assistance systems. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Not only from a business point of view, as valuable IP assets are contained within these components, but also from a safety point of view, especially when vulnerabilities lead to remotely exploitable attacks. Logical attacks in this field are abundant, but attacks using hardware centered techniques such as fault injection are underrepresented. Researchers and professionals often pay no attention in these attacks because they require physical access to the chip, ignoring that the assets obtained (e.g. firmware, keys, etc.) can be used later to prepare a remote attack.This work aims to address the lack of attention on fault injection attacks by investigating two modern microcontroller units that receive the highest safety assurance rating (ASIL-D) of the ISO 26262 automotive standard. This is done in both a theoretical characterization setup and a more realistic setup where debugging interfaces are targeted. The results obtained from these setups show that the mechanisms implemented to adhere to this maximum safety rating do not adequately protect against fault injection attacks and are therefore insufficient to ensure security by themselves #x2014; additional countermeasures are required. Each setup required approximately one week of preparation, but once the attacker finds the optimal fault injection parameters, the attack can be repeated in less than an hour. We provide some recommendations on what type of countermeasures should be considered to improve the security with respect to fault injection attacks and also provide several pointers to continue the security research in this area. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This enables computer vision tasks to be carried out directly on the focal plane in a highly efficient manner rather than using a separate general purpose computer. The strategy enables a small, agile quadrotor Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) to track the target from close range using minimal computational effort and with low power consumption. To evaluate the system we target a vehicle driven by chaotic dual-pendulum trajectories. Target proximity and the large, unpredictable accelerations of the vehicle cause challenges for the UAV in keeping it within the downward facing camera's field of view (FoV). A state observer is used to smooth out predictions of the target's location and, importantly, estimate velocity. Experimental results also demonstrate that it is possible to continue to re-acquire and follow the target during short periods of loss in target visibility. The tracking algorithm exploits the parallel nature of the visual sensor, enabling high rate image processing ahead of any communication bottleneck with the UAV controller. With the vision chip carrying out the most intense visual information processing, it is computationally trivial to compute all of the controls for tracking onboard. This work is directed toward visual agile robots that are power efficient and that ferry only useful data around the information and control pathways. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Most of the current solutions employ generic image parsing models that treat all scales and locations in the images equally and do not consider the geometry property of car-captured urban scene images. Thus, they suffer from heterogeneous object scales caused by perspective projection of cameras on actual scenes and inevitably encounter parsing failures on distant objects as well as other boundary and recognition errors. In this work, we propose a new FoveaNet model to fully exploit the perspective geometry of scene images and address the common failures of generic parsing models. FoveaNet estimates the perspective geometry of a scene image through a convolutional network which integrates supportive evidence from contextual objects within the image. Based on the perspective geometry information, FoveaNet 'undoes' the camera perspective projection - analyzing regions in the space of the actual scene, and thus provides much more reliable parsing results. Furthermore, to effectively address the recognition errors, FoveaNet introduces a new dense CRFs model that takes the perspective geometry as a prior potential. We evaluate FoveaNet on two urban scene parsing datasets, Cityspaces and CamVid, which demonstrates that FoveaNet can outperform all the well-established baselines and provide new state-of-the-art performance. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder which often goes undiagnosed and leads to serious problems like stroke, heart attacks etc. Conventional diagnosis of sleep apnea is done by continuous recording of physiological signals for 6 to 7 hrs during sleep and then manually marking the events. This process is expensive and not affordable to people in rural areas. In this work we show that detection of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can be automated using machine learning techniques. We used heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory rate variability (RRV) parameters derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory effort signals (RES) respectively as input to the support vector machine (SVM) backend classifier. In a healthy person without apnea, there would be a rhythm in the autonomic nervous system (ANS). This rhythm will change in patients with OSA, even when no sleep disorder related events are clinically visible. We use HRV and RRV features as indicators of this rhythm. Based on this, our automated system for OSA detection (ASOSAD) detects OSA without waiting for any events to happen. We used the signals in rapid eye movement (REM) state of the sleep, as the chances of occurrence of apneas are more due to complete loss of muscle tone in REM. The REM state was detected using the chin EMG signal 80% classification accuracy was obtained for the baseline system developed with time domain (TD) and frequency domain (FD) features of HRV and RRV as input. We found 10% absolute improvement in performance while using only the TD HRV features for developing the system. By analyzing the individual TD HRV and TD RRV based systems we found a complementarity in decisions. Subsequently We combined the decisions of the two systems by fusing the scores at the output of each system with weight which is calculated empirically using calibration data. For the fused system we obtained a performance improvement of 10% compared the best individual system, resulting in no error in OSA detection in REM stage. We are also exploring the possibility of developing a sleep stage independent system and the results will be reported in due course of time. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Furthermore, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are vulnerable, and subject to various passive and active attacks. So securing WSN lead up to add cryptography keys which make longer (and then more energy consumption) the packets exchanged during network running.

"UAS soaring trajectories considering the atmospheric boundary layer for oceanic long duration missions","2017","OCEANS 2017 - Anchorage","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048188083&partnerID=40&md5=3b335630a8f53341c6f33ab0a2074627","The possibility of increasing flight duration, particularly for small and micro fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), is typically hindered by the payload and size of the platform. In maritime missions, Atmospheric Energy Harvesting (AEH) near the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL), is a low-cost solution, with very promising results, that may allow drastic increases in flight duration by exploiting wind energy. The utilization of atmospheric energy is not a straightforward process. Understanding the mechanics behind the dynamic soaring process, which is the most promising form of AEH in marine applications, is key. A proper identification and characterization of the wind field is required. In addition, a smart trajectory generation and tracking module shall maximize the energy gain or to increase the flying time. The atmospheric energy represents a series of complex processes, specially when it comes to the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere in the MABL. However, the MABL has drastic gradient changes in which soaring maneuvers can be performed. This paper focuses in the study of the soaring energy transfer mechanisms, based on the the interaction between the MABL and the surface of the ocean and on observations of birds that perform swooping maneuvers. This allows the generation of energy efficient trajectories that will provide a UAS with extended time duration in an oceanic mission. The trajectory generation method considers interpolating splines that contain wind information embedded into the control points, i.e. tension, velocity and direction unitary vector, aiming to replicate the biologically-inspired Rayleigh cycle. Preliminary results in simulations are presented, showing that there are potential energy gains after executing splines that follow basic Rayleigh cycles. © 2017 Marine Technology Society.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, deciding when and where to take measurements in complex environments remains an open challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a new multiresolution mapping approach for informative path planning in terrain monitoring using UAVs. Our strategy exploits the spatial correlation encoded in a Gaussian Process model as a prior for Bayesian data fusion with probabilistic sensors. This allows us to incorporate altitude-dependent sensor models for aerial imaging and perform constant-time measurement updates. The resulting maps are used to plan information-rich trajectories in continuous 3-D space through a combination of grid search and evolutionary optimization. We evaluate our framework on the application of agricultural biomass monitoring. Extensive simulations show that our planner performs better than existing methods, with mean error reductions of up to 45% compared to traditional 'lawnmower' coverage. We demonstrate proof of concept using a multirotor to map color in different environments. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

"Prejudice against female school leadership within the context of multiple deprivations: Threats, approaches, survival; [Die aard en hantering van vooroordeel teen vroulike skoolleierskap in gedepriveerde gemeenskappe: bedreigings, benaderings, behoud]","2017","Tydskrif vir Geesteswetenskappe","10.17159/2224-7912/2017/v57n4a4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041349601&doi=10.17159%2f2224-7912%2f2017%2fv57n4a4&partnerID=40&md5=c6a420b0c84495ef0cbccc675e139d4b","Although school leadership positions are increasingly occupied by females, deep-rooted prejudice prevails regarding their competencies to act as school leaders. In this article, the focus is on the challenges facing female school leaders and the resolutions they implement in the face of ongoing prejudice within the context of a multitude of deprivations. While many studies have been conducted on the challenges and successes of female school leadership in urban and rural Western and non-Western societies, understanding female school leadership within the simultaneously occurring conditions of prejudice and multiple deprivation remains an under-researched terrain. For this study, data were collected by means of a qualitative case study approach employing individual interviews with eight female school leaders and eight members of the school management teams of eight primary schools, which serve communities where multiple deprivation is rife. The data were interpreted as research findings through the theoretical lenses of feminist theory, relational leadership theory, and multiple deprivation. The findings pertain to the various approaches female school leaders follow as survival measures to counter the threat of deep-seated prejudice against their competence to hold leadership positions. The approaches these female school leaders follow reveal the value they place on positive relationships, joint decision-making and the best possible care for vulnerable learners. Their adoption of these approaches provides a means of persuading and convincing their staff as well as the learner and parent community of their executive leadership capacities as females. Prejudice against female school leadership manifests as a deeply rooted patriarchal stereotyping of female ability. Especially prevalent in rural areas, such preconceived notions are expressed through the attitudes of members of both the internal and external school society. While some female leaders are discouraged by such prejudice, others deal with it proactively by convincing their school communities of their capacity to lead. Closely related to this attempt at winning over others is the high premium female school leaders place on building positive relationships with their staff as well as the learner and parent community. By considering the suggestions of the parent community when it comes to school improvements, a spirit of cohesive agreement develops which contributes to parents becoming more receptive to female leadership. With their conscious focus on spending enough time (quantitatively speaking) with staff during school breaks, and by considering the anonymous suggestions and complaints of learners, qualitative relationships are engendered which are based on good communication and accessibility. The fact that female leaders focus on these aspects promotes creative problemsolving and negates leadership as an exclusively male domain. Female leaders value collaborative decision-making, which they achieve by eliciting autonomous inputs from committee members. This promotes not only the taking of ownership but also a sense of belonging, which enhances stakeholder receptiveness for female leadership. To convince the community and ensure that the goals of the school are accountably realised through the assertive accommodation of joint decision-making, female school leaders invariably focus on gaining a thorough knowledge of the relevant school policies. Females make convincing leaders thanks to their disposition as caretakers. Due to their own experience of multiple deprivation as children, many of the female leaders participating in this study revealed that they understand the conditions of absolute poverty to which their learners are exposed. Since they have insight into the hopelessness of their learners' circumstances, they know the value of education as a potential source of social mobility. Their task as caretakers is closely linked to obtaining sponsorships which will expose their learners to the most holistic education possible within their own context. They realise that in order to persuade the business world to commit sponsorships, their schools must function properly to be marketed as a worthwhile product. The female leaders' empathetic approach to the wellbeing of their staff and learners inspires good performance which - with the goodwill and cooperation of the parent community - contributes to a well-functioning school. The combination of an empathetic disposition to learner well-being, their own experience of the value of education as a possible platform for social mobility, and their skills in obtaining sponsorships for the holistic schooling of their learners, engenders a positive attitude towards female leadership and serves to eradicate much of the prejudice against their competencies. The threat of prejudice against female leaders is thus countered by approaches involving the establishment of positive relationships, the application of joint decision-making processes and an empathetic focus on the circumstances inhibiting learners' progress. The dogged pursuit of these approaches results in females being viewed as convincing school leaders who provide the most holistic education possible within their context to learners - elements which serve to help female leaders to survive and thrive.","Review","Final","Scopus"

The probabilistic automaton is combined with the genetic algorithm to construct a learning system of Genetic Algorithm-Operant Conditioning Probabilistic Automaton (GA-OCPA) according to the Skinner operant conditioning. The UAVs' evasion maneuvering flight speed, rolling acceleration and climbing acceleration are taken as the learning behaviors of the system, and the probability of selection and individual fitness are calculated after each learning attempt. The optimal path can then be obtained by searching for the best behavior using the genetic algorithm. The knowledge base of the best learned behaviors is established using Incremental Hierarchical Discriminant Regression (IHDR), and the matching mapping between the threat state and path planning is then formed. The result shows the viability and applicability of the GA-OCPA learning system for UAV path planning. © 2017, Press of Chinese Journal of Aeronautics. All right reserved.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It has wide range, long duration, non-degradability, and some other features. The accumulation of heavy metals in soil will destroy the physical and chemical properties of soil, cause irreversible pollution of environment, and further threaten human health. For mining area, influenced by human exploitation, the top soil is thin and is easily affected by atmospheric dust fall. The relationship between soil heavy metals and atmospheric dust fall could reflect the sources of heavy metals pollution. Furthermore, the transport, migration and diffusion characteristics of heavy metals in the soil-atmosphere system could be revealed through the analysis of it. Existing work has mostly focused on only top soil, which might ignore the influence of dust reduction. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the pollution status of heavy metals in the surface soil and their relevance with atmospheric dust fall. With 51 surface soil samples and 51 atmospheric dust fall samples collected from Eastern Junggar coal mining area in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, the contents of 6 kinds of heavy metals (As, Cu, Cr, Hg, Pb, and Zn) in the samples were measured in the laboratory. The geo-accumulation could be used to evaluate the pollution degree of heavy metals in soil. The potential ecological risk index takes into account the difference of the background values of heavy metals and the migration and transformation of heavy metals in the environment. The descriptive statistics of heavy metals in surface soil were carried out. Secondly, the spatial distribution, geo-accumulation, and potential ecological risk index of heavy metal from surface soil and atmospheric dust fall were analyzed. The outcomes of the analysis of them were described by ArcGIS 10.1 spatial analysis with inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method. Subsequently, the correlation between surface soil and atmospheric dust fall was analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis and grey correlation analysis. Pearson correlation coefficient has been widely used to measure the linear relationship between fixed distance variables, and the value range is from -1 to 1; the greater the absolute value, the stronger the correlation. For the grey relational analysis, if the correlation degree was greater than 0.6, the 2 factors could be regard as being correlated significantly. The results showed that: 1) There were significant spatial distinctions between 6 kinds of heavy metal elements (As, Cu, Cr, Hg, Pb, and Zn) in surface soil. The pollution level of Hg was the most serious, which could be regard as the strong polar pollution, and its potential ecological risk index reached a high ecological risk. The Zn and Cu were basically in a state of no pollution, and they were at a slight ecological risk. 2) There were obvious differences in the spatial distribution of heavy metals in atmospheric dust fall. The Zn in atmospheric dust fall was in pollution with extreme intensity, while Hg was in no pollution state. 3) Pearson correlation coefficients showed that Hg and As in the atmospheric dust fall were significantly related to the As in soil, and the correlation coefficients reached 0.72 and 0.66, separately. The results of grey correlation degree showed that the relevance between heavy metal in surface soil and atmospheric dust was notable, but varied among 6 kinds of heavy metal elements. The amount of local dust was related to human production activities and local climatic factors closely, i.e., prevailing winds and precipitation. Therefore, in further research, the size of samples will be expanded, and this important factor will be used to analyze the spatial distribution, geo-accumulation, and potential ecological risk index of heavy metals, and explore the impact of dust on it. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The current goal of development of Point-of-Care (POC) medical devices is to extract the biomedical information from the blood. We examined the characteristics of blood flow in autonomous microfluidic devices with the aim to realize sensitive detection of interactions between particulate elements of the blood and the appropriately modified surfaces of the system. As a model experiment we demonstrated the fast analysis of the AB0 blood group system. We observed that the accumulation of red blood cells immobilized on the capillary wall leads to increased lateral movement of the flowing cells, resulting in the overall selective deceleration of the red blood cell flow column compared to the plasma fraction. We showed that by monitoring the flow rate characteristics in capillaries coated with blood type reagents it is possible to identify red blood cell types. Analysis of hydrodynamic effects governing blood flow by Finite Element Method based modelling supported our observations.

The proposed algorithm utilizes multiple stereo images taken from an unmanned ground vehicle and exploits geometric features specific to stalks such as vertical continuity, height, and the direction of surface normals. The described hardware and software pipeline is capable of detecting stalks for a manipulator grasp in approximately 12 seconds, and preliminary results show that hardware improvements can reduce detection time to 4 seconds.

Recently, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has received extensive interest for PSC to fill the coverage holes and establish reliable connectivity. The UAVs can be deployed as unmanned aerial base stations (UABSs) as part of a heterogeneous network (HetNet) PSC infrastructure. In this paper, we design a PSC LTE-Advanced HetNet for different path loss models and deployment mechanism for UABSs. We enhance the system-wide spectral efficiency (SE) of this PSC HetNet by apply cell range expansion (CRE) to UABSs and mitigating the inter-cell interference arising in the HetNet by applying 3GPP Release-10 enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC) and 3GPP Release-11 further-enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (FeICIC).

This paper presents a novel probabilistic symbol pattern recognition (PSPR) approach to detect CHF in subjects from their cardiac interbeat (R-R) intervals. Method PSPR discretizes each continuous R-R interval time series by mapping them onto an eight-symbol alphabet and then models the pattern transition behavior in the symbolic representation of the series. The PSPR-based analysis of the discretized series from 107 subjects (69 normal and 38 CHF subjects) yielded discernible features to distinguish normal subjects and subjects with CHF. In addition to PSPR features, we also extracted features using the time-domain heart rate variability measures such as average and standard deviation of R-R intervals. Results An ensemble of bagged decision trees was used to classify two groups resulting in a five-fold cross-validation accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of 98.1%, 100%, and 94.7%, respectively. However, a 20% holdout validation yielded an accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of 99.5%, 100%, and 98.57%, respectively.

When viewing chromatograms, some ambiguities are shown at various sites along the DNA sequences, because the program implemented in the sequencing machine and used to call bases cannot always precisely determine the right nucleotide, especially when it is represented by either a broad peak or a set of overlaying peaks. In such cases, a letter other than A, C, G, or T is recorded, most commonly N. Thus, DNA sequencing chromatograms need manual examination: checking for mis-calls and truncating the sequence when errors become too frequent. The purpose of this paper is to develop a program allowing the automatic correction of these ambiguities. This application is a Web-based program powered by Shiny and runs under R platform for an easy exploitation. As a part of the interface, we added the automatic ends clipping option, alignment against reference sequences, and BLAST. To develop and test our tool, we collected several bacterial DNA sequences from different laboratories within Institut Pasteur du Maroc and performed both manual and automatic correction. The comparison between the two methods was carried out. As a result, we note that our program, ABI base recall, accomplishes good correction with a high accuracy. Indeed, it increases the rate of identity and coverage and minimizes the number of mismatches and gaps, hence it provides solution to sequencing ambiguities and saves biologists' time and labor. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Semi-Global Matching (SGM) is a popular method of choice for solving this task which is already in use for production vehicles. Despite the enormous progress in the field and the high level of performance of modern stereo methods, one key challenge remains: robust stereo vision in automotive scenarios during rain, snow and darkness. Under these circumstances, current methods generate strong temporal noise, many disparity outliers and false positives on object level. These problems are addressed in this work by regularizing stereo vision via prior information. We formulate a temporal prior and a scene prior, which we apply to SGM in order to overcome the deficiencies. The temporal prior integrates knowledge from the previous disparity map to exploit the high temporal correlation, the scene prior exploits knowledge of a representative traffic scene. Using these priors, the object detection rate improves significantly on a driver assistance dataset of 3000 frames including bad weather while reducing the rate of erroneous object detections. We also outperform the ECCV Robust Vision Challenge 2012 winner, iSGM, on this dataset. In addition, results are presented for the KITTI dataset, even showing improvements under good weather conditions when exploiting the temporal prior. We also show that the temporal and scene priors are easy and efficient to implement on a hybrid CPU/reconfigurable hardware platform. The use of these priors can be extended to other application areas such as mobile robotics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Terrorist acts and resulting wrecks of high-speed trains will have much more serious consequences than a conventional train crash. Analysis of the capabilities of technical security systems applied to counter-terrorist protection of high-speed trains shows that there is no protection against drone terrorist attacks committed by bomb-carrying drones. Simultaneously, the special services of MI5 (United Kingdom) and the FSB (Russian Federation) have revealed information that international terrorist organizations, such as ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria), are actively investigating the possibilities of employing bomb-carrying drones as a terrorist tool. The aim of this study is to investigate the problem of protection of high speed trains against terrorist acts accomplished by such new terrorist tools as bomb-carrying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), commonly known as drones. To resolve the problem, we have developed a system for protecting high-speed trains against unmanned aerial vehicles. The operative principle of this system is based on the suppression of radio channels controlling drones. Radio channels controlling drones can be suppressed by radio interference generated by a technical security system. Such a system can be applied to the protection of high speed trains operating in France, Japan, Russia, China, the USA and other countries against terrorist attacks by bomb-carrying unmanned aerial vehicles. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed and applied to the real-time path planning of UAV based on the analysis of particle swarm optimization. The Chaos strategy prevents particles from getting into a local optimal, and Dijkstra algorithm improves the quality of the path. In static mode, the experimental comparison between paths generated by classical particle algorithm and improved particle swarm algorithm proves that improvement strategy is effective. Path planning algorithms based on PSO, RRT (Rapidly-exploring random tree) and BLP (Bi-level programming) is compared in real-time mode to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of PSO based path planning algorithm. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This issue is aggravated in constrained IoT devices equipped with minimal hardware resources. Current security and privacy implementations need to be redesigned and implemented maintaining its level of assurance, aiming for this family of devices. To cope with this issue, this paper proposes the first novel attempt to leverage anonymous credential systems (ACSs) to preserve the privacy of autonomous IoT constrained devices. Concretely, we have designed a solution to integrate IBM's identity mixer into constrained IoT ecosystems, endowing the IoT with ACSs' privacy-preserving capabilities. The solution has been designed, implemented, and evaluated, proving its feasibility. © 2018 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Based on the fact that human body radiation falls around 9.3pm, thermal images have distinctive advantages in pedestrian detection at nighttime. With the recent success of CNNs in vision community, how to properly explore information in color and thermal images in CNNs-based methods attracts attention of researchers. The contributions of this paper are twofold: First, multiple multispectral pedestrian detectors based on the Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework have been developed. Second, the performance of different pixel-level image fusion methods in multispectral CNN-based pedestrian detectors is evaluated. Extensive results based on KAIST multispectral pedestrian benchmark show that good pixel-level image fusion methods are complementary to both early-fusion and late-fusion CNN architectures at nighttime. The combination of image fusion and late-fusion CNN architectures can more properly exploit the multispectral information and achieve the best detection performance. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
"AUV thrust allocation with variable constraints","2017","Advances in Systems Science and Applications","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040739663&partnerID=40&md5=d07f027010daaf4c68e0044ca808d400","Modern multipurpose Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) represent the next generation of robotic systems with new technological tasks faced by researchers. One method of extending the functionality of the vehicle is installing tunnel thrusters in addition to the stern propulsion system. Thereby the vehicle becomes able to undertake both survey-style missions and low speed interactions with the environment. But the efficiency of the tunnel thruster depends strongly on the vehicle’s velocity, due to hydrodynamic aspects. The usual solution to this problem uses different control models and thrust allocation methods for these types of mission. A unified approach to thrust allocation is presented in this paper. The approach is based on solving the allocation problem by quadratic programming with variable constraints, depending on the velocity of the AUV and the thrusters’ angle of attack. The well-known implementation of active set method was used to model the proposed allocation method. © 2017 ASSA.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In order to protect themselves and their subscribers, ISPs invest in typical protection systems like IDS, IPS, or Firewalls, that are designed for perimeter-based operation. Even though these expensive systems are efficient to protect confined environments, they do not allow ISPs to anticipate cyber-attacks. At most, ISPs might only react to them as soon as possible to maintain network services for legitimate traffic. Based on what prior DIDS approaches have lacked, our approach relies on BGP protocol to interconnect distributed intrusion detection elements, each of which cooperating by sending information about a potential threatening flow that traverses its Autonomous System (AS). We present the architecture of our approach as well as the analytic model based on Dempster-Shafer's combination rule. The results show significant improvement in terms of reliability of the combined information, that enables better countermeasures decisions. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, data of some special or dangerous testing environment may not be accessible, or may only be accessible at certain times. So, using generative adversarial networks to learn the real traffic scene and generate a new scene is an effective way of solving the problem. In this paper, a framework of deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) was used to generate new traffic scene images and videos. Firstly, 300 sets of videos and images of overtaking scenes were selected as training data. A generator with convolutional neural network was used to generate samples. Then the training data and the generated samples were trained in a two-class discriminator that provides the probabilities of the samples that come from the generated sample and the training data respectively. Then the generator was updated by back propagation algorithm. Afterward, a new sample was generated and trained in the discriminator again. Repeated several times, a serial of generated samples were generated, the probability distribution of which is basically the same as the training data. The experiments show that this method can effectively generate realistic traffic scene images and videos. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

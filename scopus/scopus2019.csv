The problem is difficult, as these are large, complex systems which operate in uncertain environments, requiring data-driven machine-learning components. However, learning techniques such as Deep Neural Networks, widely used today, are inherently unpredictable and lack the theoretical foundations to provide strong assurance guarantees. We present a compositional approach for the scalable, formal verification of autonomous systems that contain Deep Neural Network components. The approach uses assume-guarantee reasoning whereby contracts, encoding the input–output behavior of individual components, allow the designer to model and incorporate the behavior of the learning-enabled components working side-by-side with the other components. We illustrate the approach on an example taken from the autonomous vehicles domain. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"
"The transition to HPC-based vehicle architectures: Cyber security implications","2019","VDI-Berichte","10.51202/9783181023570-431","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106002685&doi=10.51202%2f9783181023570-431&partnerID=40&md5=1e6e60a642a96ed8c7b922cff83be216","As the automotive industry moves towards fully connected cars and autonomous driving, the need for strong computing power inside the vehicle is significantly increasing. Vehicles are gathering, processing, and transmitting increasingly large amounts of data. Sent from multiple sensors, such as lidar, radar, and cameras, the different data streams need to be analyzed simultaneously and in real-time. This challenge is being met with the incorporation of High- Performance Computing (HPC) in-vehicle architectures, empowering the infrastructure with the ability to execute CPU-intensive tasks. In an HPC-based vehicle architecture, there are several HPCs grouped according to functionality, safety level, and cybersecurity considerations. These centralized high-performance platforms host multiple virtual ECUs, which control the majority of the vehicle’s functionalities, on a single processing unit using a hypervisor. The virtual ECUs are based on various operating systems (like Linux, Autosar). To enable the transmission of large amounts of data over higher bandwidths, automotive Ethernet is incorporated as the communication backbone in HPCbased architectures. This change in onboard infrastructure has introduced new automotive-specific protocols and new attack vectors and has provoked the need for further innovation in protecting vehicles against cyber-attacks. For example, attackers can compromise automotive-specific protocols to launch unprecedented DoS attacks. In these attacks, an enormous amount of data is sent to a victim network node effectively neutralizing it. This was successfully demonstrated by the Argus research team during a next-generation architecture penetration test project: a virtual Adaptive Autosar-based ADAS unit was disabled by a DoS attack, disabling the advanced driver assist functionality in a way that current cyber security solutions could not identify and block. The new virtualized environment has created a new automotive attack vector in which attackers have proven their ability to break out of a virtual ECU and compromise the host hypervisor - potentially compromising all the virtual guests. This type of attack is known as Guest to Host Escape. Alternatively, HPC architecture has introduced new security design opportunities, which enable the introduction of dedicated virtual Security ECUs to the vehicle architecture, without the added costs of an additional hardware component. As a global leader in automotive cyber security, Argus’ cooperation with multiple OEMs on securing HPC-based vehicle architecture has led to the development of a comprehensive cybersecurity approach that combines host protection and network protection in multiple modular and scalable components: host-level protection on every partition, hardening hypervisor software, advanced heuristics that pinpoint malicious network traffic, a virtual security ECU concept and more. In this paper, we will elaborate on the security challenges derived from the transition to HPCbased architecture. We will explain how this industry shift will transform existing cybersecurity concepts, and we will explore innovative protection methodologies and solutions that should be introduced into the design and production of vehicles with HPC architecture. © VDI Verlag GmbH · Düsseldorf 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
"CBRNe enabled drones - The state of play and problematic future","2019","RINA, Royal Institution of Naval Architects - IMC 2019: Pacific International Maritime Conference","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084944700&partnerID=40&md5=d7e59cbf4bf36beee6f23aec5b90a3c4","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) from both foreign military and non-state actors are becoming an increasing threat to maritime vessels. The small size and manoeuvrability of UAVs has broadened their appeal, causing significant disruption to a variety of locations such as airports and aircraft carriers, as well as potentially posing direct threat to life. UAVs have ushered in an era of low-cost and easily accessible weapons that can deliver a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNe) payload from a remote location. This paper discusses this present and future threat to maritime vessels, and the mitigation strategies available. A CBRNe UAV attack can have a significant impact on a maritime vessel. Without adequate sensors to detect a UAV or the subsequent CBRNe payload, the attack could result in; loss of life, loss of the vessel and a time-consuming and costly decontamination effort. The threat posed by UAVs will only increase in the future as the technology advances and the expense declines. A safe future for military and commercial maritime vessels increasingly depends on an organisation's ability to remove or react to a CBRNe threat. The placement of suitable detectors is therefore a key element of protection, allowing for a quick response time once the threat is detected. © 2019 RINA, Royal Institution of Naval Architects - IMC 2019: Pacific International Maritime Conference.

The key element within GAUSS is the integration and exploitation of Galileo and EGNOS exceptional features in terms of accuracy, integrity and security, which will be key assets for the safety of current and future drone operations. More concretely, high accuracy, authentication, precise timing (among others) are key GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) enablers of future integrated drone operations under UTM (UAS Traffic Management) operations, which in Europe will be deployed under U-Space [1]. The U-Space concept helps control, manage and integrate all UAS in the VLL airspace to ensure the security and efficiency of UAS operations. GAUSS will enable not only safe, timely and efficient operations but also coordination among a higher number of RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) in the air with the appropriate levels of security, as it will improve anti-jamming and anti-spoofing capabilities through a multi-frequency and multi-constellation approach and Galileo authentication operations. The GAUSS system will be validated with two field trials in two different UTM real scenarios (inland and sea) with the operation of a minimum of four UTM coordinated UAS from different types (fixed and rotary wing), manoeuvrability and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) operational categories. The outcome of the project will consist of Galileo-EGNOS based technological solutions to enhance safety and security levels in both, current UAS and future UTM operations. Increased levels of efficiency, reliability, safety, and security in UAS operations are key enabling features to foster the EU UAS regulation, market development and full acceptance by the society. © 2019 FGM Events LLC.

Ten participants completed the experiment and the results showed that they perceived and responded differently to each vehicle cyberattack. Participants correctly identified the cybersecurity issue and took according action when the issue caused a noticeable visual and auditory response. Participants preferred to be clearly informed about what happened and what to do through a combination of visual, tactile, and auditory warnings.

The dual-channel generation network we proposed is on the basis of cycle-consistent adversarial network (CCAN) and has good image feature extraction ability, which can automatically extract the features of the frame in the video, and at the same time can extract the features of the previous frame generated. By joint training of adversarial loss and cycle-consistent loss, the function from infrared domain image to color domain image can be learned by unsupervised learning methods and the colorization of the infrared video can be realized.

"An Empirical Exploration of Resilience in Human-Autonomy Teams Operating Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems","2019","Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society","10.1177/1071181319631020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123278284&doi=10.1177%2f1071181319631020&partnerID=40&md5=f91a7a29e6524997a1327665c8eac58b","Project overview. Team resilience is an interactive and dynamic process that develops over time while a team maintains performance. This study aims to empirically investigate systems-level resilience in a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) System simulated task environment by examining team interaction during novel events. The approach used in the current study to measure systems-level resilience was developed by Hoffman & Hancock (2017). In their conceptual study, resilience was considered a key feature of success in emerging complex sociotechnical systems; in our case, that is applied to Human-Autonomy Teams (HATs). Hoffman and Hancock conceptualized a resilience measure dynamically by means of several components, such as the time it took the system to recognize and characterize anomalies, and the time taken to specify and achieve new goals. In their framework, there were two main sub-events which expressed resilience via time-based measures, and upon which we designed ours in this study: (1) time taken to design a new process and (2) time required to implement it (Hoffman & Hancock, 2017). Design. In this current research, there were three heterogeneous team members who used a text-based system to communicate and successfully photograph target waypoints: (1) navigator – provided information regarding a flight plan with speed and altitude restrictions of each waypoint; (2) pilot – controlled the RPA by adjusting its altitude and airspeed through negotiating with the photographer in order to take a good photo of the target waypoints; and (3) photographer – screened camera settings and sent feedback to the other team members regarding the status of target’s photograph. This study followed the Wizard of Oz paradigm wherein the navigator and photographer were seated together in one room and were told that the pilot was a synthetic agent. In actuality, the pilot was a well-trained experimenter who was working from a separate room. This ‘synthetic’ pilot used restricted vocabulary to simulate that of a computer. The main manipulations in this study consisted of three degraded conditions: (1) automation failure-role-level display failures while processing specific targets, (2) autonomy failure-autonomous agent behaved abnormally while processing specific targets (i.e., it provided misinformation to other team members or demonstrated incorrect actions), and (3) malicious cyber-attacks-the hijacking of the synthetic agent, which led to the synthetic agent providing false, detrimental information to the team about the RPA destination. Because the malicious cyber-attack only occurred once (during the final mission), we will focus on the automation and autonomy failures for this study. Each failure was imposed at a selected target waypoint and the teams had to find a solution in a limited amount of time. The time limit for each failure was related to the difficulty of the failure. Each failure was introduced at a pre-selected target waypoint for each team. Method. In this experiment, there were 22 teams, with only two participants randomly assigned to the navigator and photographer roles for each team, because the pilot was a highly-trained experimenter. The current task was comprised of ten 40-minute missions in which teams needed to take as many “good” photos as possible of ground targets while avoiding alarms and rule violations. For this study, using the RPAS paradigm, we calculated two team resilience scores (1) time taken to design a new process and (2) time required to implement it (Hoffman & Hancock, 2017). For the calculations, we used the message sent time (in seconds) for each role to express resilience in terms of the proportion of total task time (2400 seconds). As an outcome measure, we used target processing efficiency as a coordination and time-based performance score, which was based on how quickly teams were able to take a good photo of each target. Results and discussion. We found that teams were more resilient during automation failures and progressed toward targets more successfully than during autonomy failures. We see three possible explanations for this: (1) automation failures were more explicit than autonomy failures, since at least one team member interacted with other teammates; (2) autonomy failures took more time for human teammates to identify the failure, because the autonomous agent’s abnormal behavior was not as straight forward; and 3) human teammates overtrusted to the autonomous agent and lack confidence in themselves and let the failure go on. © 2019, SAGE Publications Inc.

Despite the large amount of available visual data (images, point clouds, . . .), researchers apply augmentation techniques to extend the training dataset, which improves the classification accuracy. When trying to exploit audio data for autonomous driving, two challenges immediately surfaced: firstly, the lack of available data and secondly, the absence of augmentation techniques. In this paper, we introduce a series of augmentation techniques suitable for audio data. We apply several procedures, inspired by data augmentation for image classification, that transform and distort the original data to produce similar effects on sound.

Drones systems are reliant on virtual cyber network and embedded computational system for their operation. Cyber security is meant for protecting technologies and processes. An attacker may misuse or manipulate the sensor input or functions, or he may simply disable them to cause denial of service attacks and make unwanted failsafe mechanisms. The drone has been identified as vulnerable to cyber-attacks because of their uniqueness of network and dispersed physical systems located in remote places and because of the cyber-attacks which can result in the defective operation of the control loop, denial of service, destruction and exfiltration, and information corruption. Hence, two important concerns need to be addressed for drones are cyber airworthiness safety and cyber reliability as well as security.

Limitations of the UAV's hardware and the line-of-sight link of the air-to-ground channel make UAV ground communication more vulnerable to wiretap and spoof threats. This paper tackles the secure transmission problem with physical layer security (PLS) technologies. A four-node wiretap channel with UAV-enabled relay is considered and eavesdroppers' location information is partially known that they are in a certain area with variable densities. We put forward the secrecy rate maximization problem aiming at optimizing the source/relay transmission power. The objective function and constraints are proved to be non-convex and we convert the non-convex problem to a convex one by introducing the difference-of-concave (DC) programming and slack variables. For a special case, a closed-form solution is obtained which greatly reduces the complexity of the algorithm.

Microphone array can be efficiently used for detecting, locating and tracking acoustic sources in their environment. In recent years, the current technological improvements of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have made drones more difficult to locate using optical or radio-based systems. However, the sound emitted by UAV motorization and their aerodynamic whistling can be exploited using a microphone array and an adequate real time signal processing algorithm. The purpose of this study is to characterize the acoustic signature of a drone and to estimate its 3D position using a microphone array with few sensors. Simple trajectories of the moving source are first simulated. Two methods, beamforming and goniometry, are tested to localize the source. Measurements were carried out in anechoïc conditions to characterize the acoustic signature of the drone. Additional measurements in real outdoor flight were finally made. Results obtained by the experiments are shown and the different approaches are compared to localize the drone and to track it.

While there are techniques that provide a fault analysis automation on the cipher level to some degree, it can be shown that when it comes to software implementations, there are new vulnerabilities, which cannot be found by observing the cipher design specification. This work bridges the gap by providing a fully automated way to carry out DFA on assembly implementations of symmetric block ciphers. We use a customized data flow graph to represent the program and develop a novel fault analysis methodology to capture the program behavior under faults. We establish an effective description of DFA as constraints that are passed to an SMT solver. We create a tool that takes assembly code as input, analyzes the dependencies among instructions, automatically attacks vulnerable instructions using SMT solver and outputs the attack details that recover the last round key (and possibly the earlier keys). We support our design with evaluations on lightweight ciphers SIMON, SPECK, and PRIDE, and a current NIST standard, AES. By automated assembly analysis, we were able to find new efficient DFA attacks on SPECK and PRIDE, exploiting implementation specific vulnerabilities, and previously published DFA on SIMON and AES. Moreover, we present a novel DFA on multiplication operation that has never been shown for symmetric block ciphers before. Our experimental evaluation also shows reasonable execution times that are scalable to current cipher designs and can easily outclass the manual analysis. Moreover, we present a method to check the countermeasure-protected implementations in a way that helps implementers to decide how many rounds should be protected. We note that this is the first work that automatically carries out DFA on cipher implementations without any plaintext or ciphertext information and therefore, can be generally applied to any input data to the cipher. © 2019, Ruhr-University of Bochum.

Maize crop has in the recent past been threatened by the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda, J. E Smith) which has caused considerable maize yield losses in the region. Controlling this pest requires knowledge on the time, location and extent of infestation. In addition, the insect pest's abundance and environmental conditions should be predicted as early as possible for integrated pest management to be effective. Consequently, a fall armyworm pheromone trap was deployed as a monitoring tool in the present study. The trap inspection is currently carried out manually every week. The purpose of this paper is to bring automation to the trap. We modify the trap and integrate Internet of Things technologies which include a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ micro-computer, Atmel 8-bit AVR microcontroller, 3G cellular modem and various sensors powered with an off-grid solar photovoltaic system to capture real-time fall armyworm moth images, environmental conditions and provide real-time indications of the pest occurrences. The environmental conditions include Geographical Positioning System coordinates, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction. The captured images together with environmental conditions are uploaded to the cloud server where the image is classified instantly using Google's pre-trained InceptionV3 Machine Learning model. Intended users view captured data including prediction accuracy via a web application.

"Does Team Interaction Exploration Support Resilience in Human Autonomy Teaming?","2019","Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society","10.1177/1071181319631492","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111880937&doi=10.1177%2f1071181319631492&partnerID=40&md5=1824b44e6012969ea6db9904bd990062","Project overview. As a team explores interactions, they may find opportunities to expand and refine teamwork over time. This can have consequences for team effectiveness in normal and unexpected situations (Woods, 2018). Understanding the role of exploratory team interactions may be relevant for human-autonomy team (HAT) resilience in the face of synthetic agent rigidity and lack of anticipation (Demir et al, 2019). Team interaction exploration was defined as team interactions with qualities (e.g. content, communication medium) unique to a team’s interaction history (Cooke et al., 2013; Hills et al., 2015). This study examines the relationship between team interaction exploration and HAT performance in multiple remotely-piloted aerial system (RPAS) reconnaissance missions with degraded conditions. The goal of the task was to take good photos of target waypoints. In this task, three teammates are assigned to specific roles: the navigator plans the route using a digital map, the pilot (synthetic) controls the RPAS and selects target waypoints, and the photographer calibrates camera settings to take a good photo of a target waypoint. The synthetic agent was capable of routine team coordination without explicit team player qualities. Teams communicated via a text-chat interface. Seven unique degraded conditions were injected throughout ten missions. Three automation failures disrupted RPAS status information on the photographer’s or pilot’s display, and three autonomy failures disrupted the synthetic agent’s comprehension of waypoint information or caused the agent to move on to the next target before a photo was taken. Finally, a malicious cyber-attack caused the synthetic agent to fly the RPAS to an enemy occupied waypoint. Method. Forty-four participants were recruited from a large southwestern university in pairs and formed teams (22 teams) to participate in this study. These participants were either undergraduate or graduate students. This experiment consisted of ten 40-minute missions in total that were carried out over two sessions separated by one- to two-week intervals. After a baseline mission, an automation and autonomy failure was injected into each mission while the team processed target waypoints. The malicious cyber-attack occurred during the final 20-minutes of the tenth mission. This study collected a several measures including measures of team process, physiological measures, and surveys of teamwork knowledge, trust, workload, and anthropomorphism which are not considered in this study. Exploratory team interaction was operationalized as any text-message unique in content, sender, or recipient that was unrelated to routine coordination of target waypoints. Teams were grouped using k-means clustering by their target processing efficiency, number of overcome roadblocks, and mission performance. The three clusters (K = 3) were comparatively described as low- (N = 7), middle- (N = 7), and high-performing (N = 5) teams. A mixed-factor ANOVA compared the frequency of each team’s exploratory interactions by mission and cluster. Results and discussion. High-performing teams were distinguished from middle- and low-performing teams in their ability to maintain high levels of overall performance while efficiently processing targets and overcoming many roadblocks. Middle-performing teams were efficient in overcoming roadblocks but had worse mission performance. The findings indicate that 1) high-performing teams explored team interactions more than middle-performing teams, 2) there was no significant difference in exploration frequency between high- and low-performing teams, and 3) teams explored more in the first session than the second session, with the exception of the final mission. Overall, exploratory team interaction differentiated HAT performance in normal and degraded conditions and should be further examined at other levels of interaction, such as content meaning and interaction patterns. © 2019 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Aerial surveying is a sampling method that has been used to estimate wildlife abundance over large or inaccessible areas. An increasing trend in aerial surveying methodology is to use remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), also known as drones, in lieu of traditional manned aircraft systems such as planes and helicopters. Studies which used RPAS instead of manned aircraft have recently attempted to analyse imagery using automated detection methods. While there are a number of advantages to this approach, there are also potential issues in abundance estimation using this data since the errors associated with using these approaches are largely unaccounted for in established models of abundance estimation. In this paper we applied a model developed by Terletzky and Koons (2016) for fixed wing survey, to data derived from RPAS surveys that has been processed by an automated detection method for koalas. The data collected enabled ground-truthing of detections which allowed both the probability of detection and the probability of duplicate detection to be accounted for in abundance estimates, as well as a comparison between the estimates and the true number of koalas present on site. Overall, it was found that the Terletzky & Koons (2016) method resulted in artificial inflation of abundance estimates when using data collected from RPAS surveys with automated detection. This is likely to have resulted from false positive detections, which can have a considerable impact on the accuracy of automated wildlife counts. Incorporating more sources of error than the probability of detection and duplicate detection appears to be essential to improving abundance estimation for these novel survey methods. An exploration of additional covariates that could affect detection in RPAS-derived thermal imaging due the unique constraints of these technologies should be considered in future model development.

"Defeating UAVs through novel HPEM effectors","2019","Proceedings - 31st International Symposium on Ballistics, BALLISTICS 2019","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085923483&partnerID=40&md5=620e1b48e59ff1f3a40a3947906aaf91","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are sophisticated, autonomous, low-cost systems that may become a threat when supplemented with energetic charges or improvised explosive devices (IED) as deadly payloads. While single UAVs may be defeated through air defense systems or new laser effectors, a swarm of them may, however, saturate such systems, especially when they fly coordinated attack patterns. Another encouraging concept generates either omni-directional, near-distance or directed, far-distance electromagnetic effects consisting of an explosively driven flux compression generator (FCG), an electrical opening switch, and the subsequent shaping of the electrical pulse into a high frequency (HF) radio signal transmitted by an antenna. This enables a promising compact design approach for integration into mobile effectors such as missiles or shoulder-launched munitions defeating swarms of UAVs as well as other electronic systems, devices, and components. FCG prototypes, a test setup and diagnostics including a Rogowski probe for current measurements were developed for proof-of-principle trials with iutput currents measured of several hundreds of kA. This complies to a current amplification factor of approx. 30 also predicted through a system simulation. In other subcomponent tests, a continuous and a pulsed microwave generator were used for generating radio signals transmitted by a horn antenna. The effectiveness of the emitted signal is eventually evaluated against commercially available UAVs like a Phantom 4. These vulnerability tests were performed at an anechoic chamber with parameters varied including antenna distance and direction to the target as well as pulse and idle times of the interference signal. These experimental results were also used for verifying simulation models created with LTspice. © 2019 by International Ballistics Society All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In particular, we investigate existing software analyzers and verifiers, which implement fuzzing and bounded model checking (BMC) techniques, to detect memory safety and concurrency errors. We also investigate fragility aspects related to the UAV communication link. All UAV components (e.g., position, velocity, and attitude control) heavily depend on the communication link. Our preliminary results show that fuzzing and BMC techniques can detect various software vulnerabilities, which are of particular interest to ensure security in UAVs. We were able to perform successful cyber-attacks via penetration testing against the UAV both connection and software system. As a result, we demonstrate real cyber-threats with the possibility of exploiting further security vulnerabilities in real-world UAV software in the foreseeable future.  © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The various approaches that have been investigated to minimize infection risks from washbasin traps and drains are then discussed together with their relative advantages and disadvantages.

This remote sensing tool monitors the surrounding air space in a circle with a radius of 6-7 km with high temporal and spatial resolutions (∼100 m horizontally, scan frequency: 2 minutes). The elevation angle of the lidar's laser beam is set to a constant of 3°, which corresponds to the angle of the glide path of the landing aircraft.

In this work, we consider a scenario in which the target moves across a large geographical area by following a road network and the search is performed by a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We formulate search and tracking as a combinatorial optimization problem and prove that the objective function is submodular. We exploit this property to devise a greedy algorithm. Although this algorithm does not offer strong theoretical guarantees because of the presence of temporal constraints that limit the feasibility of the solutions, it presents remarkably good performance, especially when several UAVs are available for the mission. As the greedy algorithm suffers when resources are scarce, we investigate two alternative optimization techniques: Constraint Programming (CP) and AI planning. Both approaches struggle to cope with large problems, and so we strengthen them by leveraging the greedy algorithm. We use the greedy solution to warm start the CP model and to devise a domain-dependent heuristic for planning. Our extensive experimental evaluation studies the scalability of the different techniques and identifies the conditions under which one approach becomes preferable to the others. ©2019 AI Access Foundation.

It allows for vehicles to navigate in the correct lanes, position themselves correctly so to be able to affect future manoeuvres. For this purpose, several solutions have been developed to estimate the absolute and relative position of these in real-time. The only source available to estimate their absolute position is through the use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). To place vehicle positioning within the stringent requirements that autonomous driving demands, much effort has been made in recent years to bring to the automotive sector the advanced error correction techniques applied in other domains like aviation. These include error correction in the position computed by a GNSS receiver using PPP algorithms (Precise Point Positioning). As PPP signals can be broadcasted widely, costs can be shared and thus be low, hence the attractiveness for the automotive industry. To operate, PPP uses a feature available in most modern vehicles - that is connectivity. Cellular communications allow the downloading of correction data that is computed with the positioning information processed by a GNSS receiver. The algorithms using the PPP signals output location estimates with an accuracy of a few centimetres, which respond to the needs of autonomous driving. This paper presents state-of-the-art in positioning technologies valid for the autonomous driving requirements. It focuses on a solution to exploit the possibilities of GNSS systems based on on-board connectivity. The manner how this solution is implemented and verified in public roads as part of the ESCAPE project is detailed. The ESCAPE project, funded by the European GNSS Agency, researched around the referred technologies with the aim to develop a precise positioning system for autonomous vehicles. ESCAPE applies PPP corrections to the GNSS data processed by an advanced dual frequency multiple constellation GNSS receiver. PPP corrections are downloaded from the Internet through the cellular link that the unit provides. They are combined with vehicle odometer data and other on-board sources. The system outputs high accurate positioning, velocity and time (PVT) information together with integrity information in the form of protection levels. The latter is needed to satisfy the safety requirements of autonomous vehicles. The developed system was designed to respond to the positioning needs of autonomous vehicles, nevertheless its capabilities can be used too in different types of driving assistance systems. The advanced positioning features in the ESCAPE system can be an invaluable aid to maximize the use of regulation services such as the emergency call. The availability of precise position is an enabler for applications requiring spatial-temporal information like in the case of vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure communication technologies.

Due to operational and economic issues, it is a reasonable approach to simulate the most hazardous flight stages before proceeding to flight test. Warsaw University of Technology (WUT) developed PZL SW-4 helicopter dynamic model implemented in FLIGHTLAB environment in scope of HELIMARIS project. The model should represent actual performance and dynamics of helicopter in basic flight states (hover, cruise, climb/descent, turn, etc.). Compliance with this requirement allows to predict PZL SW-4 behavior in harsh maritime environment, especially focused on ship approach, in a reliable manner. Presented effort is complementary with analyses and laboratory tests done simultaneously by the other project subcontractor - Ship Design and Research Centre (CTO), which purpose is to obtain ship air wake and helideck motion data to be integrated in FLIGHTLAB environment. Investigation will result in definition of safe and efficient operational procedure for light maritime helicopter. The purpose of the paper is to present each particular phase of required input data preparation done by PZL-Świdnik (Original Equipment Manufacturer; OEM). Therefore, it provides necessary background for detailed control algorithms description and regulator system adjustment, performed by Warsaw University of Technology. PZL-Świdnik provided definition of mass, inertial and geometrical data set in basic helicopter configuration. This included geometry of main rotor hub, tail rotor hub, stabilizers and landing gear. Position of sensors, indicators and all relevant systems was defined. Main rotor system definition contains also damping characteristics of lag damper. Main rotor and tail rotor blades were defined in terms of necessary properties distribution (mass, inertia, chord). Aerodynamic characteristics of airfoils in entire range of section Mach number were verified and tailored in order to achieve flight test compliance. Static stiffness and strength of landing gear was obtained from stand test results, including also limits for landing conditions. Fuselage was defined in terms of aerodynamics. Due to high predicted angles of attack and sideslip in ship air wake, supplementation of already used characteristics was required. CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) ANSYS Fluent solver was employed to obtain missing data. Results were tailored to obtain compliance with existing characteristics in narrow range of inflow angles and with actual power required for flight. Fuselage aerodynamics is to be supplemented by floats once detailed configuration is available. Helicopter control system was defined in terms of kinematic ratio between controls and swashplate position. Kinematics of swashplate was supplemented by longitudinal/lateral feathering coupling and main rotor flap feathering coupling formulation. Dynamic characteristic of hydraulic actuators was also provided. PZL-Świdnik calculated vortex ring conditions envelope. Propulsion system definition was a distinct phase of dynamic model development. It included description of kinematic ratio between collective lever and engine control lever position. PZL-Świdnik provided detailed kinematics of engine controls and nominal engine control characteristics (nominal output power vs engine control lever position). Fuel system mass flow limits and tank capacity were based on PZL SW-4 Rotorcraft Flight Manual. Simultaneously, set of flight test data was prepared. Dedicated flight test program was prepared and performed. It contained measurements of state parameters relevant for dynamic identification in time domain and validation of the model. First of all, sign convention and measurement system characteristics were provided to obtain compliance and integrity with simulation results. Then, controls input signals were defined for dynamic response investigation. There were two types of inputs - long step and fast doublet. Two groups of dynamic response flight states were established: near-ground maneuvers (hover in-ground effect, hover off-ground effect, directional movements) and forward flights (level flight, climbing/descent, turns). Each contained both long step and fast doublet control input in every control channel (collective, longitudinal cyclic, lateral cyclic, pedals). General description of test helicopter configuration and external conditions were provided. Second stage of flight test was equilibrium conditions and control margins investigation. PZL-Świdnik provided detailed controls positon (swashplate pitch and roll), helicopter attitude (fuselage pitch and roll), and rotors collective angles in trimmed level flight. The same data set was prepared for autorotation. Static equilibrium conditions were compared with results obtained from own O50 FORTRAN code. The last group of static tests was in-ground controllability and maneuverability. It contains presentation of controls position vs wind azimuth. Distinct phase was a definition of static performance and dynamic characteristics of propulsion system. Static performance of RR M250-C20R/2 engine was calculated using Rolls-Royce application. Dynamic characteristic includes propulsion system time response in relevant flight states (start-up, vertical take-off, landing from high hover, entry into autorotation, recovery from autorotation). Dedicated on-ground propulsion system stability test was used for engine sub-model calibration. Initial validation of entire model was done with support of selected steady flight test data. Flight test data obtained from landings on a moving platform was used for initial definition of ship landing procedure. Approach and take-off profile were established. Data set contained state parameters measurements correlated with video recording of each particular approach. Additionally, influence of control chain dynamic stiffness and slack of the controls was assessed. Swashplate position calibrated from controls was compared with that calculated kinematically from actuator extension. MATLAB script was employed to calculate transfer function between actuators extension and swashplate position and to compare with flight measurements of actuator forces. Static slack of the controls was defined from stand tests. PZL provided also qualitative and quantitative criteria for dynamic model similarity assessment for both dynamic response and static equilibrium part. These were defined in terms of simulation results as follows: response vector signs compliance, attitude deviation from measurement at certain time from input signal beginning, controls position difference in trimmed steady flight. A vital phase of the project is PZL SW-4 autopilot sub-model development. It required detailed definition of sub-system functionality, general architecture, emergency scenarios, requirements and limitations. Autopilot sub-model should allow to perform basic flight states in whole PZL SW-4 operational envelope with Stability Augmentation System (SAS) functionality. Additional automatic flight modes will be tailored to support wide spectrum of maritime missions in both manned and unmanned configuration. The most critical phase is automatic vertical take-off and landing with sea state up to 5. Manual landing procedure will be extensively examined during simulation campaign. © Statement The authors confirm that they, and/or their company or organization, hold copyright on all of the original material included in this paper.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions, which was already shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into oncoming traffic. In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certified defense for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose the optimal action under a worst-case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. The approach is demonstrated on a Deep Q-Network policy and is shown to increase robustness to noise and adversaries in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios and a classic control task. © 2019 CoRL.

Such software adds non traceable hazards to traditional hardware and sensors failures, not to mention attacks that fool the prediction of a DNN and hampers its robustness. Formal methods from computer science are now applied to deep neural networks to assess the local and global robustness of a given DNN. Typically static analysis with Abstract Interpretation or SAT solvers approaches are applied to neural networks and leverages the important progress of formal methods over the last decades. Such approaches estimate bounds on the perturbation of the inputs and formally guarantee the same DNN prediction within these bounds. However formal methods over DNN for image perception system have only been applied to simple image attacks (2D rotation, brightness). In this work, we extend the definition of Lower and Upper Bounds to assess the robustness of a DNN perception system against more generic attacks. We propose a general method to verify object recognition systems using Abstract Interpretation theory. Another major contribution is the adaptation of Upper and Lower Bounds with the abstract intervals to support more complex attacks.

For UAS, the removal of the pilot from onboard the aircraft has eliminated the ability of the ground-based pilot in command (PIC) to use out-the-window visual information to make judgements about a potential threat of a loss of well clear with another aircraft. NASA’s Phase 1 research supported the development of a Detect and Avoid (DAA) system that supports the ground-based pilot’s ability to detect potential traffic conflicts and determine a resolution maneuver, but existing display/alerting requirements did not account for multiple UAS control (1:N). Demands for increased scalability of UAS in the NAS operations are expected to create a need for simultaneous control of UAs, and thus, a new DAA HMI design will likely be necessary. Previous research, however, has found performance degradations as the number of vehicles under operator control has increased. The purpose of the current human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation was to examine the viability of 1:N operations with the Phase 1 DAA alerting and guidance. Sixteen UAS pilots flew three scenarios with varying number of UAs under their control (1:1, 1:3, 1:5). In addition to their supervisory and sensor mission responsibilities, pilots were to utilize the DAA system to remain DAA well clear (DWC) during scripted conflicts of mixed severity. Measured response times, separation performance, mission task data, and subjective feedback were collected to assess how the multi-UAS control configuration impacted pilots’ ability to maintain DAA well clear and perform the mission tasks. Overall, the DAA system proved surprisingly adaptive to multi-UAS control for preventing losses of DAA well clear (LoDWC). The findings suggest that, while multi-UAS operators are able to maintain safe separation (DWC) from other traffic, their ability to efficiently perform missions drastically decreases with their number of controlled vehicles. Pilot feedback indicated that, for this context, the use of automation support tools for completing and managing mission tasks would be appropriate and desired, especially for ensuring efficient use of assets. Finally, human-machine interface (HMI) design considerations for multi-UAS operations are discussed. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The disruptive technologies AI is based on (as well as respective applications) are likely to influence the competition on and for various markets in due course. The handling of opportunities and threats re AI are so far still an open question-and research on the competitive effects of AI has just commenced recently. Statements about AI and the corresponding effects are thereby necessarily only of a temporary nature. From a jurisprudential point of view, it is however important to underline (not only) the framework for AI provided by competition law. On the basis of the 9th amendment of the German Act Against Restraints of Competition (ARC) 2017, German competition law seems to be-to a large extent-adequately prepared for the phenomenon of AI. Nevertheless, considering the characteristics of AI described in this paper, at least the interpretation of German (and European) competition law rules requires an ‘update’. In particular, tacit collusion as well as systematic predispositions of AI applications re market abuse and cartelization analyzed in this paper are to be pictured. Additionally, this paper stresses that further amendments to (European and German) competition law rules should be examined with respect to the liability for AI and law enforcement, whereby the respective effects on innovation and the market themselves will have to be considered carefully. Against this background, this paper argues that strict liability for AI might lead to negative effects on innovation and discusses a limited liability re public sanctions in analogy to intermediary liability concepts developed in tort law, unfair competition law and intellectual property law. Addressing the topic of a ‘legal personality’ for AI-based autonomous systems, this paper finally engages with the consequences of such a status for competition law liability. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

This uptake is not least due to the widespread availability of cheap unmanned aerial vehicles/drones, which help mitigate the challenging terrain and deliver efficient and reproducible and high-accuracy images and topographical data. These data can have unprecedented spatio-temporal coverage and includes measurements of fluvial and aquatic topography, hydraulics, geomorphology and habitat quality. SfM data also offer novel quantification of underwater archeology, structures and aquatic organisms. Studies are shifting from proof-of-concepts in topographic survey to genuine applications including grain-size mapping, bathy-metric surveys, geomorphological mapping, vegetation mapping, restoration moni-toring, habitat classification, geomorphological change detection and sediment transport path delineation. Integrating point cloud analyses and orthophoto mosaics with digital elevation models has been shown to be effective in providing novel process understanding of fluvial and aquatic systems. Underwater and through-water studies are beginning to overcome problems of accessibility, visibility and image distortion. Archival photographs and video (both above-and under-water) are being reprocessed using a SfM workflow to generate three-dimensional surfaces and objects from historical surveys, thereby extending the time period over which change can be detected. Recently, a SfM workflow has been developed to model free water surfaces with clear potential for future exploitation in hydraulics, sediment transport and river bed evolution studies. Future applications of SfM could seek to exploit the daily repeat coverage of high-resolution satellite images but must be mindful of the necessary investment in this development versus the increasing availability and coverage of spaceborne light detection and ranging.

The reason? The AI revolution is not so much about cyborgs and super-robots in the future, but rather massive changes in the here-and-now of everyday life. In The Culture of AI, Elliott explores how intelligent machines, advanced robotics, accelerating automation, big data and the Internet of Everything impact upon day-to-day life and contemporary societies. With remarkable clarity and insight, Elliott’s examination of the reordering of everyday life highlights the centrality of AI to everything we do - from receiving Amazon recommendations to requesting Uber, and from getting information from virtual personal assistants to talking with chatbots. The rise of intelligent machines transforms the global economy and threatens jobs, but equally there are other major challenges to contemporary societies - although these challenges are unfolding in complex and uneven ways across the globe. The Culture of AI explores technological innovations from industrial robots to softbots, and from self-driving cars to military drones - and along the way provides detailed treatments of: • The history of AI and the advent of the digital universe; • automated technology, jobs and employment; • the self and private life in times of accelerating machine intelligence; • AI and new forms of social interaction; • automated vehicles and new warfare; • and, the future of AI. Written by one of the world’s foremost social theorists, The Culture of AI is a major contribution to the field and a provocative reflection on one of the most urgent issues of our time. It will be essential reading to those working in a wide variety of disciplines including sociology, science and technology studies, politics, and cultural studies. © 2019 Anthony Elliott.","Book","Final","Scopus"

How the aerodynamic controls and propulsion should be coordinated to realize fuel-optimal precise landing is addressed in this paper. To this end, a model-based optimal control problem is formulated with the rocket’s angle of attack and thrust as control inputs, and constraints on the controls are included to reflect the capabilities of the vehicle. Precise landing requires the (highly nonlinear and nonconvex) problem to be solved onboard in real time. This ability of online computation is becoming increasingly desired in aerospace guidance and control for autonomous missions. Hence, this paper presents how to solve the rocket landing problem via convex optimization that has guaranteed polynomial-time complexity. Specifically, a novel methodology of handling the rocket nonlinear dynamics is introduced, and a relaxation technique used to convexify nonconvex constraints is theoretically proved to be valid. High efficiency of the proposed method, with potential for online computation, is demonstrated by numerical examples and comparisons with other methods. © 2018 by Xinfu Liu.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This paper introduces a semantics-driven automated approach for solving population health problems with descriptive statistical models. A fusion of semantic and machine learning techniques enables our semantically-targeted analytics framework to automatically discover informative subpopulations that have subpopulation-specific risk factors significantly associated with health conditions such as hypertension and type II diabetes. Based on our health analysis ontology and knowledge graphs, the semantically-targeted analysis automated architecture allows analysts to rapidly and dynamically conduct studies for different health outcomes, risk factors, cohorts, and analysis methods; it also lets the full analysis pipeline be modularly specified in a reusable domain-specific way through the usage of knowledge graph cartridges, which are application-specific fragments of the underlying knowledge graph. We evaluate the semantically-targeted analysis framework for risk analysis using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and conclude that this framework can be readily extended to solve many different learning and statistical tasks, and to exploit datasets from various domains in the future.

An important challenge is, contrary to classical systems studied so far, the great difficulty in predicting their future behaviour from initial time because, by their very structure, interactions strength between system components is shielding completely their specific individual features. Independent of clear existence of strict laws complex systems are obeying like classical systems, it is however possible today to develop methods allowing to handle dynamical properties of such systems and to master their evolution. So the methods should be imperatively adapted to representing system self organization when becoming complex. This rests upon the new paradigm of passing from classical trajectory space to more abstract trajectory manifolds associated to natural system invariants characterizing complex system dynamics. The methods are basically of qualitative nature, independent of system state space dimension and, because of its generic impreciseness, privileging robustness to compensate for not well known system parameters and functional variations. This points toward the importance of control approach for complex system study in adequate function spaces, the more as for industrial applications there is now evidence that transforming a complicated man made system into a complex one is extremely beneficial for overall performance improvement. But this last step requires larger intelligence delegation to the system requiring more autonomy for exploiting its full potential. A well-defined, meaningful and explicit control law should be set by using equivalence classes within which system dynamics are forced to stay, so that a complex system described in very general terms can behave in a prescribed way for fixed system parameters value. Along the line traced by Nature for living creatures, the delegation is expressed at lower level by a change from regular trajectory space control to task space control following system reassessment into its complex stage imposed by the high level of interactions between system constitutive components. Aspects of this situation with coordinated action on both power and information fluxes are handled in a new and explicit control structure derived from application of Fixed Point Theorem which turns out to better perform than (also explicit) extension of Popov criterion to more general nonlinear monotonically upper bounded potentials bounding system dynamics discussed here. An interesting observation is that when correctly amended as proposed here, complex systems are not as commonly believed a counterexample to reductionism so strongly influential in Science with Cartesian method supposedly only valid for complicated systems. © 2019 by author(s) and Frontier Scientific Publishing.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It does not fi t into any of the categories of supernatural beings present in the beliefs of the Andean peoples. It exists within its own, autonomous category, genetically rooted in the historical reality of the fi rst decades of the conquistadors, as well as in the indigenous mythology. It is a conceptualization and visualization of a deep cultural trauma and its psychological resolution, which provides imaging for the new, unknown existential fears. Fear of the unknown establishes the emotion helplessness, while fear of a known enemy enables development of defense strategies. In Andean millenarian myths of the period aft er the Conquista the pishtaco came into existence as a symbolic fi gure of an enemy which would disappear only aft er the awaited revitalization of the idealized Incan empire. Pishtaco has neither one single face, or even one single appearance. During the last 500 years it appeared in the costumes of a monk, a cruel Spanish hacendado, a soldier, a doctor, or anyone perceived as a “stranger” by traditional campesinos. Th e oldest visualizations, documented as early as in the XVI c., are still alive today, interconnected with the ones created later. Even today the belief in the pishtaco remains surprisingly strong. It constitutes a proof for a perfect internal structure of this belief, allowing it to adapt to the new threats. Pishtaco attacks the Indians, kills them and melts their fat, however, it does not eat it (since it is not a variation of a vampire!), but transfers it to the White Men, who use it to harden the devices they produce. Th e oldest and most common oral lore tells about adding the Indian fat to the metal alloy used to create bells. Th e newer lore tells about using this fat to power vehicles, computers, or telephones. Th e logic of this belief is based on an extremely positive valorization of fat in the traditional Andean communities, that have seen it as a substance of life and vital powers, since the earliest times. Pishtaco kills Indians and takes away their fat in order, and in this way their vital power serves the enemy. Th is belief contains universal symbolism and the metaphor of eternal confl ict between the dominated Andean peoples, and diff erent embodiments of their enemies. Pishtaco is a fi gure of fear of a threat to the physical existence, and of acculturation that leads to the destruction of the group identity. Ironically, it is also an integrating aspect for those, who believe in it, allowing to identify the enemy, and mobilizing to defense. © 2019, The Polish Society for Latin American Studies.

Such public health emergencies stemming from infectious disease outbreaks is creating a serious threat to global health security. For example, climate change and extreme weather events threaten to alter and affect geographic areas pertaining to disease vulnerability, such as greater risks of mosquito-borne diseases (dengue, malaria, yellow fever and Zika). The emergence of these disease outbreaks and their influence globally has sparked a renewed attention on global health security. In the Chatham House report ‘Preparing for High Impact, Low Probability Events’, Lee et al (2012:vii) ‘found that governments and businesses remain unprepared for such events’. Recent outbreaks characterize the ‘new normal’ and has unveiled major deficiencies in preparedness, response and recovery initiatives. For example, Ae. aegypti is one of the most significant mosquito species as it is capable of transmitting dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever viruses. Understanding the emerging threat employing landscape real time epidemiological tools may ‘experimental futuring’ and scenario planning, this paper presents novel methods to predictively understand the processes by which species colonize and adapt to human habitats with a focus on the case of a virulent disease-vectoring arthropod such as Ae. aegypti. In this paper, we introduce real time ArcGIS machine learning (ML), spectral signatures in unmanned semi-Autonomous drone aircraft platform for controlling Ae. aegypti. mosquito habitats. The multivariate real time platform regressed the spatial risk of human exposure to Ae. aegypti pathogens to forecast unknown capture point georeferenceable geolocations of elevated risk.

Adversarial intruders can hack into the system through open networks and conduct malicious attacks to cause critical damage to the entire system. In this paper, we address the problem of cyber-security for process control systems. We specifically address the problem of attacks on sensor measurements. When incorrect sensor measurements are used in feedback control loops, it can lead to incorrect actuation that can cause instabilities or degrade performance. We investigate a general-purpose solution called ""Dynamic Watermarking (DW)"" to detect tampering with sensor measurements. It is shown in [9] that this technique can be used to secure linear stochastic systems in the presence of malicious sensor nodes or compromised sensor measurements. In [10], it has been shown that DW can detect attacks on autonomous vehicles. The fundamental idea of the DW mechanism is that actuator nodes superimpose a small private excitation signal on the actuation commands, as shown in Fig. 3. This additive private excitation signal to the ""Plant"" causes a change in the measurements made Sensor Nodes, in comparison to what they would otherwise be. To detect if the sensor measurements reported are genuine, we design an ""Attack Detector"", as shown in Fig. 3, that examines if the reported sensor measurements are in conformity with the secret excitation signal. Specifically, it conducts two statistical watermark tests on the reported sensor measurements. It is proved in [9] that the Attack Detector can thereby detect malicious activity. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers. All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Predictions indicate that these technologies will also contribute to reduced traffic density through increased road efficiency and will create new business models for mobility. Highly accurate and robust positioning is a required key technology in both advanced driver assistance systems and connected automated vehicle applications. Today, there are several types of sensors used in automated vehicles such as cameras, laser scanners, ultrasonic, radar, etc. The connected and automated vehicle applications currently under development are based on the cooperation between different solutions to determine the absolute position of the vehicle on the road and relative to any obstacles. No single technology can solve this in all situations, and when combining different technologies, it is vital to understand the integrity of the available information. PRoPART [1][2], will demonstrate the developed positioning solution in a truck driving in motorway conditions. The overall objective of the project is the development and demonstration of a high availability positioning solution for connected ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) applications. PRoPART has developed and enhanced an existing RTK (Real Time Kinematic) software solution developed by Waysure by exploiting the distinguished features of Galileo signals as well as combining it with other positioning and sensor technologies. Also, the possibility to authenticate the navigation message of Galileo and other navigation satellite systems through Open Service – Navigation Message Authentication (OS-NMA), adding resistance to certain spoofing attacks, has been explored during the project. Besides the use of vehicle on board sensors, PRoPART also uses a low-cost Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging solution for redundancy and robustness in areas where the coverage of GNSS is poor (e.g. in tunnels or in urban canyons) as well as Cooperative Perception using Road Side Units. © 2019 FGM Events LLC.

Although the potential of lone actors does not look so impressive compared to large terrorist groups, “lone wolves” terrorists are not becoming less dangerous. The danger of the phenomenon is due to the particular difficulty of preventing terrorist acts carried out by lone terrorists. At the same time, existing terrorist groups (e.g. ISIS), on the one hand, use the actions of lone terrorists for their propaganda purposes, and, on the other, try to inspire potential like-minded people to act alone. Thus, the actions of lone terrorists are included in the wider context of the extremist movement (“global jihad”).

In particular, the RoboVaaS vision includes a ship hull inspection service, a quay walls inspection service, an antigrounding service, and an environmental and bathymetry data collection service. In this paper, we present a study of the underwater environmental data collection service, performed by a low-cost autonomous vehicle equipped with a very low-cost acoustic modem and moving within a network of submerged acoustic sensor nodes. To this end, an underwater acoustic network composed by both static and moving nodes has been implemented and simulated with the DESERT Underwater Framework, where the performance of the smartPORT Acoustic Underwater Modem have been mapped in the form of lookup tables. The performance of the modem has been measured near the Port of Hamburg, where the RoboVaaS concept will be demonstrated with a real field evaluation. © 2019, I.A.C.M, Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas.

"Two-Stage Kalman Filter for Estimation of Wind Speed and UAV States by using GPS, IMU and Air Data System","2019","WSEAS Transactions on Electronics","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147467487&partnerID=40&md5=cefbcbd84edde08f3d0fb780a7ff9120","In this study, an estimation algorithm based on a two-stage Kalman filter (TSKF) was developed for wind speed and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) motion parameters. In the first stage, the wind speed estimation algorithm is developed by the usage of GPS measurements and dynamic pressure measurements. For this purpose, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) was designed. The wind speed is estimated by the EKF using GPS and pitot tube measurements. Here, the wind speed components and pitot scale factor are considered as state vector variables. As there is no information of the state dynamics, dynamic equations are expressed in this case by random walk process. In the second stage, the estimation of the state parameters of the UAV dynamic model was made based on the Air Data System (ADS) and IMU measurements by using the Linear Kalman filter (LKF). The second stage filter uses ADS pitot tube, angle of attack and side sleep angle measurements, IMU attitude angle and velocity measurements, and the first stage EKF estimates of the wind speed values. © 2019 World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

A precise and targeted weed control would bring about positive consequences from both environmental and economic perspectives. Given the small spectral differences between crop species, VNIR hyperspectral data can be a powerful tool to perform an effective weed monitoring and identification when high spatial and spectral resolution data is available (i.e. UAV platforms). This work explores the spectral differences between crops and weeds to evaluate the ability of UAV hyperspectral data to separate maize crop from weeds and to discriminate different types of weeds. To this aim, UAV and field hyperspectral data were acquired in some maize fields in Italy during the 2016 growing season. Results showed that by exploiting leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, retrieved using spectral indices or by inverting PROSAIL, is it possible to discriminate between maize crop and weeds and, moreover, among weed types. The procedure allowed the quantification of crop/weeds relative ground cover, which showed a good relationship with the corresponding measured relative LAI values. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Based on the principle of control link spoofing attack, it is proved that the security intensity of remote control data is too low for civilian UAV by an attack example, and a remote control data protection method based on encryption algorithm is proposed. The selection principle of encryption algorithm is discussed, and the feasibility of three encryption algorithms AES, PRESENT and RC4 are analyzed from two aspects of security and performance. The AES algorithm is selected to encrypt the remote control data packet in the control link of UAV system. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is analyzed quantitatively by using the coefficient of difference and correlation between different remote control data. Experimental results show that this method can effectively improve the safety of remote control data for civilian UAV. © 2019, Editorial Office of Computer Engineering.

"Classification of oil spill thicknesses using multispectral uas and satellite remote sensing for oil spill response","2019","International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8900170","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111346185&doi=10.1109%2fIGARSS.2019.8900170&partnerID=40&md5=05879898f8bf03cf1b432c03ccaf3f8d","Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are an operational tool for monitoring and assessment of oil spills. At the same time, satellite imagery has been used almost entirely to detect oil presence/absence, yet its ability to discriminate oil emulsions within a detected oil slick has not been fully exploited. Additionally, one of the challenges in the past has been the ability to deliver strategic information derived from satellite remote sensing in a timely fashion to responders in the field. This study presents UAS and satellite methods for the rapid classification of oil types and thicknesses, from which information about thick oil and oil emulsions (i.e., ""actionable""oil) can be delivered in an operational timeframe to responders in the field. Experiments carried out at the OHMSETT test facility in New Jersey demonstrate that under specific viewing conditions satellites can record a signal variance between oil thicknesses and emulsions and non-emulsified oil. Furthermore, multispectral satellite data acquired by RADARSAT-2 and WorldView-2 were combined with data from a UAS field campaign to generate an oil/emulsion thickness classification based on a multispectral classification algorithm. Herein we present the classification methods to generate oil thickness products from UAS, validated by sea-truth observations, and quasi-synoptic multispectral satellite images acquired by WorldView-2. We tested the ability to deliver these products with minimum latency to responding vessels. During field operations in the Gulf of Mexico, we utilized the UAS multispectral system to identify areas of shoreline impacted by the oil spill. This proof-of-concept test using multispectral UAS data to detect emulsions and deliver a derived information product to a vessel in near-real-time sheds light on how UAS assets could be used in the near future for oil spill tactical response operations. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

At that point, sensitive data is exposed unencrypted on the gateway host, thus vulnerable to attacks. In this paper, we provide a solution to this weakness of federated architectures by using hardware-assisted trusted computing (TC). We propose an approach where the new Intel's CPU extension, namely Software Guard eXtension (SGX), is exploited to guarantee the trustworthiness of the weakest link - i.e., the gateway - in spite of an aggressive attack model. The validation of our work was realised through the European eHealth infrastructure, namely OpenNCP, that enables cross-border health care and establishes shared practices to implement mechanisms and policies allowing patient data exchange between distinct national eHealth systems.

Driving simulators provide a safe and cost-efficient tool for studying driverautomation interaction, and this paper outlines general considerations for simulator-based evaluation protocols. Several challenges confront automation evaluation, including the limited utility of standard measures of driver performance (e.g., standard deviation of lane position), and the need to quantify underlying mental processes associated with situation awareness and trust. Implicitly or explicitly vehicle automation encourages drivers to disengage from driving and engage in other activities. Thus secondary tasks play an important role in both creating representative situations for automation use and misuse, as well as providing embedded measures of driver engagement. Latent hazardshazards that exist in the road environment and merit driver attention, but do not materialize to require a driver response-have been used with great success for understanding the vulnerability of novice drivers. Latent hazards might provide a similarly useful index of driver attention to the road during periods where the automation is vulnerable to failure. With highly automated vehicles, latent hazards include potential roadway threats that might not be sensed by the automation and would require driver attention. This paper describes driving simulator scenarios used to operationalize automation-relevant latent hazards, secondary tasks tuned to index driver disengagement from the driving task, and measures that reflect safety margins rather than driving performance, such as drivers’ trust, situation awareness, and expected time to transition to manual control. © 2020 SAE International.

Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, Blockchain, Data Analytics, Big Data, Robotics (autonomous vehicles, drones, RPA), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Digital Twins, AR/VR has catalyzed this transformation. For instance, the deployment of AI systems to help optimize Bakken Shale wells running on SRP's, implementation of Blockchain drilling for well construction activities, VR/AR visualization of Canada SAGD oilfields, proactive adjustments to ESP using real-time data analytics in Kazakhstan gas condensate wells are some of the recent transformations the industry has witnessed. As the Oil and Gas 4.0 simplifies, modernizing and securing the legacy environments for the new digital era, a robust Digital Assurance is essential. Digital Assurance is an exclusive digital service employing an end-to-end ecosystem approach with intelligent and automated processes to gain quality and speed for promoting faster business, technology change and better customer experience. The service shall offer evaluation of new tools and testing environments such as the cloud, software testing tools, mobile environment, and application performance. Digital Assurance is more than the traditional QA; the evolution of Agile methods with DevOps tools and techniques for software/simulator development and testing has made its deployment quick, safe and reliable. The end-to-end testing process serves to simulate the real user on-field scenarios and validate the system under test and its components for integration and data integrity. Leveraging Digital 2.0 transformations, smart oilfields (by implementing autonomous robots) can eliminate human intervention in potential risk areas and thereby providing a safe, compliant workplace for engineers, managers, crewmembers and other personnel. Especially, robotics has potential applications in inspection, maintenance, and safety operations. In alignment with this, our personalized robotic testing solution can automate various peripheral devices and has resulted in reduced testing cycle time up to 30% and cost by 40%. The solution enables automated end-to-end IoT device interactions spanning smart devices such as camera, thermostat, sensors and web applications in oil and gas facilities. Adding, our various other in-house digital framework and solutions such as Big Data validation framework, cloud-based on-demand testing, and automated test scriptwriters have eased digital transformations. Digital Assurance by rigorous testing practices can also immune oil and gas majors from the cyber threats for the cloud (grid, storage) and blockchain. To overcome such compromises in hardware failure, our smart and innovative IoT Test Workbench solution for integration testing can reduce the hardware dependency up to 100%. This novel solution virtualizes Rapid IoT Solution development replacing smart devices during testing under extreme conditions such as HPHT wells and permafrost conditions in the Arctic Circle. Furthermore, Digital Assurance compliance coupled with digitalization knowledge and experience can play a paramount role in averting disasters such as GOM deepwater explosion and Montara oil spill in the future.

They persist in treated wastewater effluents mostly as nanocontaminants leading to toxicity and disruption of both biotic and abiotic components of the receiving environment. The presence of atenolol (antihypertensive), acetaminophen (analgesic), norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin (antibiotics), carbamazepine (antiepileptic), and ketoprofen and diclofenac (antiinflammatory) usually in nanoquantities have been well documented. Effective biomonitoring tools for these pharmaceutical nanocontaminants need to entail the use of multivariate sensitive, fast, portable (for in situ application), and automated technologies. Therefore, there is a need to further assess alternative technologies like biosensors, with potential overriding benefits. Biosensor technologies have advanced, which allows improved detection, self-sampling, and in situ application. Biosensors use various functional units and aptamers to improve on their effectiveness in detecting contaminants in the environment. Nanomaterial-based biosensors, for example the use of nanoparticles as nanomaterial support or functional unit as well as antibodies or probes that are used as biological-recognition element, are promising tools in water monitoring. This allows specific quantitative analytical information to be generated by utilizing various existing biological-recognition elements. The application would also provide a better road map toward more effective bioassays, biomarkers, and microbial community analyses on the total effluent before final release. This chapter ventures to critically assess the existing pharmaceutical nanobiosensors for the monitoring of PPCPs and microbial contaminants in water, the potential for improvement, possible challenges, and suggested way forward toward a more effective contaminant free water system. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, it requires detailed specification of the external forces applied, such as vehicle speeds, loci, and axle weights. This paper introduces a novel media-fusion framework to obtain a bridge dynamic model in a fully data-driven fashion.

In the proposed approach, the robot is able to infer the operator intentions from the human contact forces, exploiting such information to properly react to the operator interventions and suitably adapt the execution of the shared task. In particular, we assume that the robotic system can autonomously generate and execute Cartesian trajectories, while a human operator can provide interventions exerting contact forces on the robot itself. The resulting robot motion is obtained by mixing in an adaptive manner the input commands provided by both the robotic control system and the human operator. In our approach, human intention estimation relies on a Neural Network capable of distinguishing the operator contact forces that support or oppose the autonomous motion planned by the robotic system. We tested the system at work in different scenarios considering simple interaction tasks performed with the 7-DOF Kuka LWR IIWA manipulator and comparing the performance obtained by a human operator with and without the assistance of the proposed system.

In the future this will even increase since it is expected that GNSS role will be of paramount importance for the development of autonomous systems. Although modern GNSS satellite systems provide high level of performances with respect to signal in space and correction of atmospheric propagations there are local vulnerabilities namely (interferences multi-path, spoofing) that may degrade the performances or even cause the unavailability of GNSS positioning. In this paper we will first explain why it is important to address the GNSS vulnerabilities at user segment level and what are the key vulnerabilities to be considered. Following that we will illustrate two typical applications that require a high level of confidence in GNSS positioning (integrity). First one is related to the geolocation of airports vehicle in order to avoid “runways incursions” that are a major risk to the aircraft. The second is about large infrastructures inspections such as electrical lines or railways networks that are requiring autonomous drone operations over distances greater than 200 km. After having set the problem we propose to address the user segment architecture in a more coordinated manner to ensure its robustness. The proposed vision is to organise the user segment into functional layers formalized by a “reference model” and to address vulnerabilities effects and mitigations at each layer. Finally we will illustrate some technical achievements that demonstrate the technical feasibility of our proposed concepts using advanced software radio platforms from National Instruments. © 2019 FGM Events LLC.

At the core of an autonomous vehicle is the advanced driver assistant system (ADAS). In order to realize the goal of a fully autonomous vehicle, new functionalities are envisaged and continuously integrated into modern vehicles. The advanced features come with increased security and safety considerations. Traditionally, the achievement of cybersecurity and safety had different requirements. However, a successful security attack on a vehicle or its component(s) can have a negative impact on its operational safety, and therefore a holistic approach is needed in which the two domains complement each other. Recently, it has been argued that there are similarities between the security and functional safety engineering processes. The newly published international functional safety standard, ISO 26262:2018, stops short of describing a security engineering process. However, it recommends that the interactions between functional safety and cybersecurity should be taken into account as early as in the concept phase of a development project. The ISO/SAE 21434 Automotive Cybersecurity Standard, which is under development at the time of this writing, tackles the complete cybersecurity lifecycle of a vehicle right from the concept phase up until its decommissioning. Whereas the safety lifecycle is dominated by process oriented thinking and a methodological mind-set with the aim of preventing faults, security engineering is shaped by techniques to prevent intentional faults (security attacks) which might harm the system and may have potentially degrading consequences for safety. In this paper, the challenges of interactions between safety and security engineering for ADAS systems are discussed. It is shown how the communication, interaction and cohesion between the functional safety and security teams are helping in the engineering of ADAS software. Moreover, best practices and findings regarding efficient and integrated engineering processes are highlighted. © VDI Verlag GmbH · Düsseldorf 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The main enabler for autonomous driving is connectivity, which in turn is enabled by wireless communication technologies such as mobile networks. The aforementioned technologies are already part of a modern vehicle. However, these technologies potentially open a vehicle to a wide range of remote cybersecurity attacks. Remote attacks can be performed from a distant location, without a physical connection to the attacked vehicle. If such attacks are performed on a very large scale, e.g., on a fleet of vehicles, they will not only have a negative impact on the safety of the victim vehicles but also have consequences for other road traffic participants such as pedestrians, other road vehicles and their passengers. It is now well established in the IT industry that security should be considered right from the concept phase. A “security by design” approach needs to be fully implemented for the development of autonomous vehicles as well, where security is considered in all phases of the development lifecycle including in the concept phase like the safety counterpart. Guidelines for threat analysis and risk assessment of vehicular systems are proposed SAE J3061. A follow-up standard, ISO/SAE 21434, addresses cybersecurity for the complete lifecycle of a vehicle, right from concept, up until decommissioning. In this paper, some of the security risk assessment methods for connected vehicles, proposed in standards and literature, are reviewed and their applicability to fully autonomous vehicles is analyzed. The hazard analysis and risk assessment method from ISO 26262, which is used in the functional safety domain, is investigated and its parallels with threat analysis and risk assessment methods of the security domain are drawn. Finally, a recent study on borrowing elements, such as controllability, from the safety domain and extending it to the controllability of an attack by a fully autonomous driving system is also discussed. © 2019, VDI Verlag GMBH.

"Layered Dynamics and System Effectiveness of Human-Autonomy Teams Under Degraded Conditions","2019","Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society","10.1177/1071181319631307","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105173993&doi=10.1177%2f1071181319631307&partnerID=40&md5=e9e73bc14d45a8f1d917ada7536c9ed7","Project overview. Teamwork can be defined as dynamic team interaction between two or more interdependent members to achieve a shared goal. Many studies have examined how coordination dynamics are associated with team effectiveness in the context of all-human teams (Gorman, Amazeen, & Cooke, 2010), and later, in human-autonomy teams (HAT)s (Demir, Likens, Cooke, Amazeen, & McNeese, 2018). HATs must have autonomous agents that act as effective teammates and help enable HATs to function as collaborative systems. Synergistic relationships among a system’s human and technological components provide the basis for emergent systems-level outcomes. Layered dynamics, a recent empirical modelling technique aimed at achieving this objective (Gorman et al., 2019), considers reorganization of the sociotechnical system across individual components and the overall system. The current study examined layered dynamics of HATs during automation and autonomy failures and addresses how members of HATs interact with each other and technological aspects of the system. Design and Method. We utilized a simulated Remotely Piloted Aircrtaft System (RPAS) Synthetic Task Environment with three heteregeneous and interdepedent roles: (1) a navigator, who created a dynamic flight plan and provided waypoint related information; (2) a pilot, who used this information to monitor and adjust settings. The pilot also communicated with the photographer to negotiate settings and enable proper conditions to obtain a good photograph; and (3) a photographer, who monitored and adjusted the camera to take good target photos, and provided feedback to the team. This study utilized a Wizard of Oz paradigm, in which the navigator and photographer were instructed that the pilot was a synthetic agent. However, the pilot was a highly-trained experimenter, in a separate room, who simulated an autonomous agent using limited vocabulary. There were 22 teams, and two participants were randomly assigned to the navigator and photographer roles. This task was comprised of ten 40-minute missions, and teams needed to take as many good photos as possible while avoiding alarms and rule violations. The primary manipulation was the application of three degraded conditions: (1) automation failure-role-level display failures, (2) autonomy failure-autonomous agent’s abnormal behavior, and (3) malicious cyber-attacks-the hijaking of the RPAS, with the synthetic agent providing false, detrimental information. We symbolically represented RPAS using layered dynamics, and calculated entropy measures for each (Gorman et al., 2019): (1) communications: team members interacting within the chat system; (2) vehicle: states of the RPA, including airspeed/altitude, turns, fuel, battery, remaining film, and termperature level; and (3) controls: the interface controls between the RPA and the team members. To measure team performance, we used a time and coordination based metric for each target in each mission. Results and Discussion. Our main findings were: 1) vehicle and communication entropy were higher than control entropy and were associated with better adaptation to both failures, and 2) control entropy had a negative association with initial status on team performance, while vehicle entropy had a positive association. These findings describe the tendency of low performing teams to anticipate targets poorly. This was due to a failure to interact with the technology in a timely manner. This lagged effect can be attributed to teams taking too long to interact with the technology. These findings shed light on how the layered dynamics approach can help understand team behavior under degraded conditions. © 2019, SAGE Publications Inc.

"How Should We Drive Self-driving Vehicles? Anticipation and Collective Imagination in Planning Mobility Futures","2019","Urban Book Series","10.1007/978-3-319-96526-0_6","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141515107&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-96526-0_6&partnerID=40&md5=3de83528dd5dbb1e75f5deaf3401dcfb","Self-driving vehicle (SDV) technology, in its current foundational stage, brings about significant uncertainties, indicating a society-wide disruption. In this context, one cannot disentangle envisioning futures with SDVs from questions of (re)distribution of societal benefits and burdens. Contrastingly, the need for strategies to cope with this disruption has recently been recognized through several planning efforts. Despite their fruitfulness, missing an elaborated understanding of technology as a socio-technical phenomenon remains an underlying challenge. However, reclaiming technological futures as plannable spaces requires understanding that human ends are not well-defined or static, and that technology does not have unstoppable, unquestionable, momentum. At the central point of contention, we argue for replacing the language of unintended consequences with the language of unanticipated consequences. Furthermore, we recognize the threat of anticipation inequality if we solely rely on expert-based practices. To support divergent envisioning efforts, we propose a phase of participatory expansion of technological horizons for (un)desirable futures. To this end, we provide an example from an online discussion platform for reflective engagement about mobility futures with SDVs for a neighborhood in the Helsinki capital region. Finally, we reflect on challenges for inter-organizational learning in coping with contingencies. © Springer Nature Switzerlan AG 2019.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"
"High-Throughput Approaches for Phenotyping Alfalfa Germplasm under Abiotic Stress in the Field","2019","Plant Phenome Journal","10.2135/tppj2019.03.0005","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086995682&doi=10.2135%2ftppj2019.03.0005&partnerID=40&md5=c7292014991078fc01fa97deec20f7c1","Core Ideas Remote sensing technologies enable rapid and nondestructive phenotyping of plants in the field. Biomass estimate accuracy from images and sensors was similar to yields harvested manually. Biomass yield variation identified the most productive accessions under low-input conditions. High-throughput phenotyping technologies enable monitoring plant growth and development nondestructively throughout the growing season. Crop losses associated with abiotic and biotic factors threaten the sustainability of crops used for feed, fiber, and fuel. The process to develop improved cultivars with enhanced crop yields includes phenotyping hundreds of plants under a target set of conditions. However, the manual collection of data is often laborious and time consuming. Strategies that integrate remote sensing technologies including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and sensors mounted on “phenomobiles” can streamline phenotyping efforts in plant breeding programs. The objectives of this study were to compare the phenotypic data collected from the field using UAVs, sensors, and manual approaches and to assess the potential of high-throughput approaches to rank the productivity of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) accessions growing in the field. Phenotypic data were collected from 100 alfalfa accessions established and grown under low-input conditions. Specific traits evaluated using both UAVs and sensors mounted on a phenomobile prior to physically harvesting the biomass during four harvests include biomass yield, plant height, normalized difference vegetation index, leaf area index, and ground coverage. The results from both the UAV and the sensors were highly correlated to the physical measurements obtained for the multiple traits evaluated. Therefore, field-based high-throughput phenotyping strategies represent a viable option for efficiently screening germplasm in the field to increase phenotyping efficiencies in plant breeding programs. © 2019 The Authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

According to the WHO, cardiovascular disease is the modern-day disease. However, prognosis rate of cardiac disease patients can be potentially made high with early detection and diagnosis. In this book chapter, we describe automated cardiac health monitoring system using smartphone and wearable sensors. The main contribution of such mobile applications and systems is to form a connected universe with biomedical sensors, patients, physicians, clinics, hospitals, and other medical service providers and to exploit robust analytics to infer and actuate the appropriate information and formative actions. The powerful anomaly analytics exploit AI, signal processing, and deep learning mechanisms that enable predictive decision-making and facilitate preventive cardiac health screening. The main emphasis is to develop and deploy smart, computationally efficient, rather than human-in-loop, user-friendly, data-driven cardiac healthcare solutions, where patients and healthcare service providers are seamlessly connected. In this book chapter, we discuss about important cardiovascular signals, namely, electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), and heart sound or phonocardiogram (PCG), and describe their role in the process of developing a mobile-based cardiac care solution. These cardiac marker signals constitute an intelligent and robust feature space for detection of different cardiac abnormalities and diseases like coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmia, and others. These sensor signals can be captured by affordable wearable sensors. In order to develop such mobile applications and systems, we need to address different challenges like noisy signal removal and data privacy protection along with providing robust analytics engine. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

Specially, we propose a distributed conflict detection and resolution method for multi-UAVs in formation based on consensus algorithm and strategy coordination. When encountering threat swarms, the UAVs in one swarm act as one unit and are together treated as one control object. Each swarm in conflict selects three candidate collision avoidance maneuvers from the preset strategy pool, generates the corresponding planned trajectories with an uncertainty trajectory modeling, and then broadcasts and shares them. All of the swarms in conflict coordinate and determine an optimal combination of strategies. When a collision is imminent, the primary strategy is activated. Each swarm adopts a 'leader-follower' strategy, where the leader UAV is regarded as the controller and flies independently, and the others follow the leader UAV. During motion, a decentralized consensus algorithm is adopted for agents to converge to their positions for the desired formation and to maintain a stable geometric configuration. A temporal and spatially integrated conflict-detection model is improved, especially for UAV swarms. A token-allocation strategy is especially improved for distributed coordination to resolve the partial knowledge of the airspace condition. Damping of the coordination is proposed to address data dropouts and transmission delays. Two typical scenarios are conducted to test the methodology proposed in this paper. The simulation result demonstrates the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed methodology. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To this end, an exhaustive review of the most relevant literature on the subject was carried out. The historical precedents of neuroeducation can be traced back to the introduction of psychological discourse in education, which later transformed into the psychologization of school. Arguably, the irruption of the neuro in the culture and the advent of the new neurosubjectivities ended up dethroning psychology of its privileged position in the educational context. Under promises of liberation, independence and scientificity, neuroeducation prospered precipitously without addressing the multiplicity of philosophical, methodological and ethical difficulties that still plagues it. However, the structural relationship between psychology and neuroscience reveals the inability of the latter to detach itself from the psi paradigm. Moreover, from the counterpsychology theory and considering its analog behavior, it can be argued that the neuro, rather than an independent stage, is an extension of the psi conditioned to this epoch. Under this approach, neuroeducation is not an alternative to psychological predominance but a return to it which threatens neurologization. Thus, it is imperative that learning is reconnected to culture, educational spaces are reconquered, and the teachers are made aware of their agency so that education can, without ignoring the valuable contributions of the other disciplines, recognize itself as an autonomous knowledge, eminently integrationist and independent. © Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Of particular interest is the degree to which Artificial Intelligence can be employed to make the MQ-9 autonomous. In order to make the MQ-9 fully autonomous machine learning and deep learning will need to be integrated into the operating systems of the MQ-9. The following analysis will be divided into three sections. The first will be to explain the technical capabilities of the MQ-9 drones. This will be followed by a discussion of understanding the barriers that need to be overcome to make the MQ-9 fully autonomous. A review of concepts related to driving automation, 'human out-of-the-loop', and the OODA loop distinctions will be conducted as these concepts will be needed to be enacted by a fully autonomous weapons system. The effort to make the MQ-9 a fully autonomous weapons platform will need to overcome limitations that currently exist with the weaponry and will then move on to discuss strategies for how to overcome them. The second section will deal with the ethical and social issues in regards to the drones and the drone program. The third and final section will develop recommendations as to how to go about rectifying the ethical and social issues with the MQ-9 with artificial intelligence. The ethical issues that will be examined include the fact that the operating system of drones can be hacked, the collateral damage caused by the use of drones and the emotional stress placed on the operators (pilots and sensor operators), more specifically how to go about dealing with that stress. The analysis will proceed by developing a stakeholder based analysis. Primary stakeholders will be defined as those who are immediately affected by the use of drones. The engineers, those killed in drone strikes and the drone operators will all be considered to be primary stakeholders. The secondary stakeholders, those that could potentially become primary in the future, will include the future targets of drone strikes, the foreign nations, and the general public. The recommendations developed as a result of the conclusions reached in this analysis involve reviewing what AI conjoined with the MQ-9 must accomplish to make the MQ-9 autonomous. There should an official global and bipartisan set of rules and guidelines put together to clearly define how, when, where, and under what circumstances a drone strike can be executed. In addition, all branches of the military should have policies in place on effective ways to reduce the stress on the drone operators. In order to discuss the military's drone program, it is helpful to focus on the use of a single drone, the MQ-9 Reaper. The Reaper will serve as an example of the evolution of the drone program's development. Through the discussion of the MQ-9 progress can be made towards developing an autonomous drone, the technical and ethical issues will be understood, and recommendations can be developed to attempt to alleviate these problems. UAVs (Aerial Robots) have changed the nature of warfare and this case study will inform the audience of ethical issues related to the MQ 9 ""Reaper"" UAV. This analysis employs a methodology of applied ethical analysis to conduct research on the obstacles that must be overcome in the area of AI to make the MQ-9 fully autonomous, while focusing on ethical issues raised by using AI to make the MQ-9 fully autonomous. © European Conference on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, ECIAIR 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Internet is used for a broad number of reasons such as searching for information, entertainment, socializing, expressing opinions or disseminating ideas. The emergence of the internet has dramatically changed the way that humans interact with their social environment and increased the pluralism of voices within the public sphere by providing a space for non-mainstream organizations to publicize their opinions (Kavada, 2005). Especially over the last decade, social activism relying on the internet, which McCaughey and Ayers (2003) call “online activism”, has become an increasingly popular and effective way of sharing information and organizing people to express resistance. Specifically, online activism can help organize people, initiate and mobilize crowds, and provide the possibility of organizing events with high levels of engagement and focus (Ghobadi and Clegg, 2015; Bennett and Segerberg, 2011; Carty, 2010; Ottaway and Hamzawy, 2011; Postmes and Brunsting, 2002). Activists increasingly take advantage of the internet technology to go beyond organizational boundaries and enable social and political change. Yet, research on online activism and the role that new technology may play in it is scarce. Environment is one of the main subjects of online activism. Environmental damage caused or accelerated by globalization such as the loss of biodiversity, climate change, exploitation of natural resources, deforestation, extinction of a vast array of species are evident (Ehrenfeld, 2005).

As seen in nature, birds like the albatross utilize the temperature effects resulting from their wings’ color to increase their flight efficiency. In this paper, the effects that differences in surface temperatures of birds’ black/white wings, colored flat plates, and albatross airfoil (GOE 174) with heating films is investigated. Such effects are applicable to the efficiency of fixed-wing drones. Experimentally, it is observed that the surface temperature of black birds’ wings is over 50% higher than white wings under solar radiation. The application of a novel heated top surface on an airfoil (GOE 174) results in the drag coefficient decreasing up to 60% and the lift coefficient increasing up to 70% in specified angles of attack compared to a non-heated top surface. This method of utilizing thermal effects can be considered as a new applicable way to increase the flight efficiency in fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicles. © 2019 by American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This problem is compounded by the presence of social interactions between humans and their physical interactions with the scene. While the existing literature has explored some of these cues, they mainly ignored the multimodal nature of each human's future trajectory. In this paper, we present Social-BiGAT, a graph-based generative adversarial network that generates realistic, multimodal trajectory predictions by better modelling the social interactions of pedestrians in a scene. Our method is based on a graph attention network (GAT) that learns reliable feature representations that encode the social interactions between humans in the scene, and a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture that is trained adversarially to predict, based on the features, the humans' paths. We explicitly account for the multimodal nature of the prediction problem by forming a reversible transformation between each scene and its latent noise vector, as in Bicycle-GAN. We show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance comparing it to several baselines on existing trajectory forecasting benchmarks. © 2019 Neural information processing systems foundation.

These archetypes are powerful, and durable, but they must be confronted and challenged if we are to truly address the real issues that the wholesale introduction of AI presents. This paper will argue that the problem lies not with AI in itself, but in its ability to act as a force multiplier for our own innately human biases and prejudices; as Safiya Noble and Caroline Criado Perez among others have shown, the underlying algorithms driving much of today's AI are based on entirely prejudiced assumptions, and build racism and sexism into the automated systems on which the modern world relies. As with so much within the cyber domain, the problem is not technological, but human, and it requires a human solution. What will be argued here is that greater use of AI is both inevitable and potentially hugely beneficial, but that it requires close examination of the underlying assumptions on which the fundamental programming of machine intelligences is/will be based.

If these software systems could automatically adapt to hardware changes, it would significantly reduce the maintenance cost and enable rapid upgrade. In this paper, we study the problem of how to automatically adapt to sensor changes, as an important step towards building such long-lived, survivable software systems. We address the adaptation scenarios where a set of sensors are replaced by new sensors. Our approach reconstructs sensor values of replaced sensors by preserving distributions of sensor values before and after the sensor change, thereby not warranting a change in higher-layer software. Compared to existing work, our approach has the following advantages: A) exploiting new sensors without requiring an overlapping period of time between new sensors and old ones; b) providing an estimation of adaptation quality; and c) scaling to a large number of sensors.

"A decomposed dual-cross generative adversarial network for image rain removal","2019","British Machine Vision Conference 2018, BMVC 2018","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084016233&partnerID=40&md5=2fe598f02ecf68a714ea26584c4a71f6","Rain removal is important for many computer vision applications, such as surveillance, autonomous car, etc. Traditionally, rain removal is regarded as a signal removal problem which usually causes over-smoothing by removing texture details in non-rain background regions. This paper considers the issue of rain removal from a completely different perspective, to treat rain removal as a signal decomposition problem. Specifically, we decompose the rain image into two components, namely non-rain background image and rain streaks image. Then, we introduce an adversarial training mechanism to synthesize non-rain background image and rain streaks image in a Dual-Cross manner, which makes the two adversarial branches interact with each other, archiving a win-win result ultimately. The proposed Decomposed Dual-Cross Generative Adversarial Network (DDC-GAN) shows significantly performance improvement compared with state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world images in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures (over 3dB gains in PSNR). © 2018.

On a multi-hop, wireless sensor network, it may be desirable for a node to issue a system-wide alert on detection of an event of interest. However, if there is a high false-positive rate, then system-wide false alarms may frequently occur. Giant honeybees (Apis dorsata) generate large-scale spiral waves triggered by the presence of a threat. Studies show that the initial seed of the waves and the re-transmission behavior are non-trivial and thus may be specially tuned for this low-communication scenario. Motivated by these adaptive patterns in giant honeybees, we develop a distributed approach for sharing awareness of critical events that is able to damp the propagation of false-alarm signals.

Easy access from shore, as well as the geopolitical context of the two islands, has made the mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) of Bonaire and Curaçao among the most well studied in the world. MCE research has been conducted in the region since the 1970s, and ongoing research employs state-of-the-art exploration technologies such as manned submersibles, autonomous underwater vehicles, and mixed-gas, rebreather technology. Mesophotic coral communities in Bonaire and Curaçao are typically dominated by agariciids, with Agaricia lamarcki and A. grahamae covering a substantial proportion of the substrate at upper mesophotic depths (30–60 m), while the lower mesophotic (>60 m) consists predominantly of A. grahamae and A. undata. Although much of the habitat is dominated by sediment with only patchy coral growth, in some locations coral assemblages can cover up to 100% of the seafloor down to depths of 70–85 m. Recent biodiversity studies, mostly focusing on fishes, sponges, and corals, documented only limited overlap between shallow and mesophotic reef communities, and that MCE biodiversity is strongly structured by depth. Since MCEs in Bonaire and Curaçao harbor highly specialized communities facing specific threats deriving from their proximity to urbanized land, these ecosystems warrant new management policies and conservation measures. These measures should protect the whole extent of these reefs, which rank among the healthiest in the Caribbean region. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

Unlike the current literature in which drones are operated together with trucks, we considered drone-only and truck-only delivery systems in which each customer is either served completely by a drone or a truck. A mixed integer non-linear programming model incorporating the queueing theory was developed to create an optimal network layout for the emerging transportation method and determines the optimal transportation channel for each of a given set of customer locations. Meanwhile, automated battery swap machines (ABSMs) were considered to extend drone service ranges. Even though ABSMs enable the realization of drone-only delivery systems, they reveal other issues, such as high machinery costs and queue waiting times for drones. The proposed optimization model incorporated a multiclass M/D/1 queueing model to account for waiting times of drones receiving battery swap service at ABSM locations. Besides the service channel for each customer, the optimization model decides optimal locations for ABSMs for a given candidate set. A heuristic algorithm was developed to attack the computational burden caused by the integer variables and nonlinearity. This study further evaluated the economic benefits of using automated drones for e-commerce enterprises. © 2019 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2019.

One type of eWOM is of particular consideration—online reviews. Previous research shows that online reviews impact customers throughout their purchasing experience, from attitudes to products (Lee et al. 2008) to the final product choice (Senecal and Nantel 2004). In other words, a customer experience with a product starts with consulting online reviews and ends with leaving feedback online. There are several motivations for publishing online reviews: platform assistance, venting negative feelings, concern for other consumers, extraversion, social benefits, economic incentives, helping the company, and advice seeking (Hennig-Thurau et al. 2004). Nonetheless, companies still struggle to foster useful and positive online reviews (King et al. 2014). Due to their growing influence, online reviews are becoming increasingly relevant to marketers (Chen and Xie 2008). The empirically confirmed impact of reviews on consumers and the difficulty to obtain them have led companies to exploit malicious practices in online reputation management (Xiao and Benbasat 2011). These corporate practices aiming to manipulate opinions by posting deceptive content are referred to as fake reviews and have become alarmingly widespread (Mayzlin et al. 2014). Therefore, online review platforms have a difficult challenge of paramount importance to control the quality and authenticity of the published reviews. As manual moderation of online reviews is time-consuming and often not effective (Masip et al. 2012), online review platforms turn to a more efficient method of automated filtering of malicious reviews (e.g., Mukherjee et al. 2013). However, every filtering method has an error, and the biggest risk of these filtering systems is to block authentic content and dissuade consumers from sharing real experience. We carry out an online experiment to investigate the impact of customer experience with online reviews’ filtering systems on customers’ emotions and satisfaction with the product and the online platform, as well as their intention to continue publishing online reviews. The 219 respondents were asked to write an authentic review and were equally distributed among three experimental cells: (1) the review is accepted right away; (2) the review is required to be modified to conform to platform’s rules and published after the modification; and (3) the review is rejected. Our results show that reviewer’s motivation defines his/her reaction to the automatic filter. Our contribution is twofold: first, we advance the literature on automated deception detection mechanisms and their use by online reviewing platforms and, second, we propose applicable managerial solutions to avoid losing authentic content and engaged customers.

However, most of the quarries are operating without topographic plans due to a lack of surveying activities. This paper introduces an approach of using low-cost UAVs to produce digital surface models which in turn are used to draw topographic maps of quarries in Vietnam. For assessments of accuracy, safety, and working efficiency, four quarries different in terrain conditions, namely Luong Son, Long Son, Nui Nho, and Nui Dai were selected as the study areas. Ground control points were established in each area by using GNSS/RTK for camera calibration and accuracy assessment. The accuracy of DSM was assessed using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) in X, Y, Z, XY, and XYZ components. Capturing images from each site were processed by using Agisoft®PhotoScan Professional 1.5.2. The results showed that all the DSM models of the four areas have high accuracy, RMSE on the checked GCPs ranges from 1.0 to 9.0 cm, from 1.2 to 5.0 cm, from 4.4 to 13.4 cm, from 1.6 to 10.3 cm, and from 4.9 to 16.9 cm for X, Y, Z, XY, XYZ components, respectively. We concluded that the low-cost UAV based mapping technology can guarantee the accuracy of DSMs, the safety of UAV flying, and the efficiency of surveying working simultaneously when using in quarries. © 2019 Polish Mineral Engineering Society.

The authors have already presented the concept of the principle of operation of an autonomous transport module for transport from the seabed (Filipek and Broda, 2016, 2017, 2018). They designed and constructed a laboratory stand and carried out experiments, the results of which confirmed the applicability of the concept discussed in transport from the seabed. The research also included the determination of the energy source in the transport process and the changes in the average density of the transport module. Three transport concepts from the seabed were also compared in terms of their energy demand. In the next step, the authors addressed the issues of stability of the transport module in the process of immersion and ascent. In the course of these studies, there appeared the necessity of the theoretical examination of mass transfer between the transport module and the environment, which is the subject of this publication. The in-depth analysis of this issue is essential from the point of view of the practical suitability of the module for transporting from the seabed because the course of mass exchange between the transport module and the environment determines the speed of immersion and ascent. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

Invariance to these constraints would make an ideal feature attribute. Here we propose the first exploitation of consistently occurring thermal signatures generated by a moving platform, a paradigm we define as passively user-generated thermal invariant features (PUGTIFs). In this particular instance, the PUGTIF concept is applied through the use of thermal footprints that are passively and continuously user generated by heat differences, so that features are no longer dependent on the changing scene structure (as in classical approaches) but now maintain a spatial coherency and remain invariant to changes in illumination. A framework suitable for any PUGTIF has been designed consisting of three methods: first, the known footprint size is used to solve for monocular localisation and thus scale ambiguity; second, the consistent spatial pattern allows us to determine heading orientation; and third, these principles are combined in our automated thermal footprint detector (ATFD) method to achieve segmentation/feature detection. We evaluated the detection of PUGTIFs in four laboratory environments (sand, grass, grass with foliage, and carpet) and compared ATFD to typical image segmentation methods. We found that ATFD is superior to other methods while also solving for scaled monocular camera localisation and providing user heading in multiple environments.  © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, much of the past progress has been driven by developments in semiconductor technology following Moore’s Law, and there are strong grounds for believing that these cannot continue at the same rate. This, and related issues, suggest that there are huge challenges ahead in meeting the expectations of future progress, such as understanding how to exploit massive parallelism and how to deliver improvements in energy efficiency and reliability in the face of diminishing component reliability. Alongside these issues, recent advances in machine learning have created a demand for machines with cognitive capabilities, for example, to control autonomous vehicles, that we will struggle to deliver.

Defined vehicular secrecy capacity is practical and efficient in achieving physical layer security in V2V. Typically, secrecy capacity may be changed by antenna related parameters, path related parameters, and noise related parameters. In addition to these conventional parameters, we address unique vehicle-related parameters, such as vehicle speed, safety distance, speed limit, response time, etc. in connection with autonomous driving. We confirm the relationship between vehicle-related secrecy parameters and secrecy capacity through modeling in highway and urban traffic situations.

The state-of- the-art positioning technologies (such as RADAR and LIDAR) are incapable of real-time detection without emph{line-of-sight} (LoS). To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multi-point vehicular positioning technology via emph{millimeter-wave} (mmWave) transmission that exploits multi-path reflection from a emph{target vehicle} (TV) to a emph{sensing vehicle} (SV), which enables the SV to fast capture both the shape and location information of the TV in emph{non-LoS} (NLoS) under the assistance of multi-path reflections.

"Infrared object image instance segmentation based on improved mask-RCNN","2019","Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","10.1117/12.2537492","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079041907&doi=10.1117%2f12.2537492&partnerID=40&md5=f3390590dfae4f24ac287893fd53d2cc","In recent years, the traditional automotive industry has also begun to enter the field of autonomous driving technology, seeking new breakthroughs. From simple pedestrian and vehicle detection, to the instance segmentation of traffic scenes, to the ideal all-intelligent driving, it has begun to be occupied by deep learning. Research scholars have tried to build a vehicle's control strategy system entirely using computers and also proposed a full convolutional neural network that replaced the fully connected structure with convolutional ideas, realizing the transition from image classification to dense pixel prediction. This is the first step for neural network to be used for scene instance segmentation, and it is also a key step for intelligent driving. However, the effect of the full convolutional neural network is not very ideal. An important problem is that the pooling layer will lose part of the location information while aggregating the background. For dense prediction of image instance segmentation, the context information (location information) of each pixel is indispensable, which is very important for the final classification of pixels. Thus, later researchers proposed three different structures to solve this problem: cavity convolution structure, codec structure, space pyramid structure. This paper analyzes the working principles and characteristics of several different structures and compares the differences between various networks. This paper combines a Mask-RCNN to construct a new network structure for image instance segmentation. The main innovations of this paper are as follows: 1. Introduce generative adversarial network into the field of image segmentation. Combine the conditional generative adversarial network idea, using the original image as the input of the generator, and the generative to generate the desired instance segmentation result. Combine the original image with the instance segmentation result generated by the generative, or combine the original image with the manually labeled segmentation result as the input to the discriminator. By training the network so that the discriminator cannot distinguish between the image generated by the generator and the result of the manual annotation, the generator can generate a satisfactory image segmentation result. 2. Introduce superpixel information of the image. In this paper, the boundary information obtained by superpixel segmentation is input into the generator network as a segmentation condition. For the original input image, this paper uses superpixel segmentation method to obtain the subtle contour of the image, and then stacks the superpixel segmentation result with the original image as the input of the generated network. 3. Reconstructed a new image segmentation structure. In the image translation model, the processing at the boundary is often difficult to achieve good results, so this article changes the output layer of the generator to K (K represents the number of classifications) channels to output the results. This paper adopts the Encoder-Decoder structure in DeconvNet, removes the full connection layer to reduce the model parameters, and changes the pooled indexing method to the direct stacking structure. © 2019 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The airfoil consists of two flat plates, the shorter plate (flap) installed on top of the longer one and at an angle. A steady wall jet emanates from a slot located close to the flap leading edge and extending over the full wing span with the objective of increasing wing lift and reducing drag. The lift and drag generated by the free shear layer wing have been measured experimentally at low Reynolds numbers (26,000) and for different relative lengths and angles of the plates. Wind tunnel lift measurements show that steady blowing increases the maximum lift of the airfoil up to 2.8 while delaying stall. Without actuation, the high lift coefficients are obtained at high angles of attack while steady blowing generates incremental lifts level slightly influenced by the angle of attack. Steady blowing also reduces the drag coefficient at small angles of attack while it is not effective at high angles of attack. The drag reduction at small angles of attack is primarily due to a pressure reduction in the cavity between the plates and also to the thrust generated by the jet. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This is a dual problem due, on one hand, to annoyance of the community during the training flights and, on the other hand, to the risk of an early acoustic detection of the aircraft by the enemy during operations. The engine integration of such vehicles is an important characteristic for orienting the design towards either a noisy or a quiet aircraft. The potential of optimized engine integration is not exploited enough mainly because noise prediction is less developed. In order to establish a noise shielding database for a validation of acoustic prediction codes, a set of related aeroacoustic shielding tests were carried out.

However, recent studies have demonstrated that they are vulnerable to small carefully crafted perturbations, i.e., adversarial examples, which considerably decrease their performance and can lead to devastating consequences, especially for safety-critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare and face recognition. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to offer defense solutions that increase the robustness of DNNs against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel defense solution based on a Deep Denoising Sparse Autoencoder (DDSA). The proposed method is performed as a pre-processing step, where the adversarial noise of the input samples is removed before feeding the classifier. The pre-processing defense block can be associated with any classifier, without any change to their architecture or training procedure. In addition, the proposed method is a universal defense, since it does not require any knowledge about the attack, making it usable against any type of attack. The experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets have shown that the proposed DDSA defense provides a high robustness against a set of prominent attacks under white-, gray-and black-box settings, and outperforms state-of-The-Art defense methods. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

A cooperative navigation approach is proposed where autonomous flight of a (""son"") UAV in challenging environments is supported by a cooperating (""father"") aircraft flying under good satellite coverage, by means of relative sensing and information broadcast. It is assumed that flight plan for the son UAV does not take navigation issues into account and only depends on mission constraints. Thus, the paper is focused on path planning for the father UAV, and its main purpose is to define a flyable trajectory for the father that allows maximizing the accuracy in son positioning estimation when cooperative measurements are used to overcome the lack of GNSS reliable measurements. The concept of generalized dilution of precision is exploited to this aim. Son and father paths are divided into a discrete number of intervals where relative geometry can be kept constant, and father path is then optimized to provide the requested geometries. Transitions between subsequent intervals are designed taking dynamic constraints into account. Simulation results, obtained integrating Matlab and Robot Operating Systems software environments, demonstrate that proper optimization of father trajectory improves cooperative navigation performance. © 2019 by Xin Ning.

Urban environments are currently inaccessible to autonomous UAS operations supporting a majority of predicted urban use-case scenarios due to unacceptable levels of risk to ground assets. Traditional approaches and strategies for risk-mitigation and safety-assurance focus on separating flight operations away from densely-populated areas, but these strategies cannot be directly applied to operations contained entirely within these densely-populated regions. For large sparsely-populated regions with a stationary population at coarse-granularity, population-density databases can be referenced during the flight planning phase to adjust flight paths to avoid populated regions. Unfortunately, this approach is difficult to apply to densely-populated urban regions. Urban areas lack population sparsity, and at the fine-granularity needed for highly-constrained spaces characteristic of urban environments, population movement is non-stationary, time-varying, and difficult to predict. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework utilizing real-time sensing and active flight control that manages and mitigates ground risk, providing assurance of acceptable levels of safety in this challenging urban scenario. This approach shows promise towards enabling UAS access to inaccessible urban environments, allowing vehicles to identify and exploit the presence of temporarily-safe corridors.

The purpose of the control system is to perform a desired maneuver while keeping a specified visual feature in a certain position of the image plane. Since the feature tracking problem constitutes a non-linear static constraint on the system dynamics, a theoretical analysis of the equilibrium points of the system is presented, and a methodology for exploiting this result for trajectory generation is proposed. Knowledge of the loci of equilibrium points of the system, which depends on which variables are selected as dependent and independent, allows to generate a large variety of vehicle trajectories without actually using the vehicle position as variable to be regulated. Model Predictive Control is used to have the vehicle actually perform the desired maneuver while enforcing excursion constraints on relevant state and control variables. Examples are proposed for hovering relatively to a target (the visual feature), orbiting at constant altitude or spiraling around a target, and landing on a target with a desired flight path angle; all these trajectories are obtained by manipulating a minimal set of state and output variables, and without employing any guidance, trajectory tracking or path following algorithm. © 2019 by German Aerospace Center (DLR).

They provide higher power-to-thrust ratios over their free-rotor counterpart. However, ducted fans currently implemented in vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) type aerial vehicles have an inherent duct lip separation and inlet flow distortion problem in edgewise flight. This problem is severe when the flight direction of the VTOL vehicle and the rotor axis of rotation are normal to each other. Separation at the leading edge duct lip for this high angle of attack situation disallows flow from effectively entering the fan rotor causing unwanted inlet flow distortion. Discussed here will be optimized design solutions to controlling and/or eliminating this flow separation at the leading edge duct lip. The designed were three types of lip-s: parametric, detached duct lip, and double duct. The parametric lip-spoilers consisted of inner-face and outer-face duct lip-spoilers. Inner-face duct lip-spoilers predominantly contributed to increased control over the negative nose-up pitching moment while the outer face and detached duct lip-spoilers predominantly controlled the increase in the mass flow rate through the ducted fan rotor. The double-ducted fan (DDF) was successful in eliminating duct lip separation through its added second duct. The main purpose of this study is to design and test various duct lip-spoilers that improves the ducted fan aerodynamic performance in edgewise flight. The conceptual design, analysis and flow visualization for a number of novel lip-spoilers are discussed in detail. © Open Archives of the 16th International Symposium on Transport Phenomena and Dynamics of Rotating Machinery, ISROMAC 2016.

Flying animals in contrast take advantage of highly non-linear structural dynamics and aerodynamics to achieve efficient and robust flight control. It appears that the distributed arrays of flow and force sensors found in flying animals play a key roll in enabling their remarkable flight control. This paper presents current research using a wing model instrumented with distributed arrays of load and flow sensors to provide estimates of a range of aerodynamic and load related variables. The characteristics of instrumentation on the wing model, as well as those of a 1-DOF pitch rig are described and characterisation experiments carried out in a closed circuit low turbulence wind tunnel are presented. The results from these experiments show that a wealth of information can be extracted from the pressure and strain signals, including the state of the flow around the wing, and rate dependent non-linear structural and aerodynamic behaviour over a wide range of angles of attack, including well into the stall region. Using the signals from the distributed array Artificial Neural Networks were trained to provide estimates of angle of attack, airspeed, drag, lift and pitching moment. The networks were able to accurately estimate α (RMS error 0.15°), airspeed (RMS error 0.15 m/s – 1.25% Full-Scale-Error (FSE)), drag (RMS error 0.33 N – 1.78%FSE), lift (RMS error 0.57 N – 0.60%FSE) and pitching moment (RMS error 0.03 N m – 5.00%FSE). These estimators provided good estimates even in the stall region when the distributed array pressure and strain signals became unsteady. Future applications based on distributed sensing could include enhanced flight control systems that directly use measurements of aerodynamic states and loads, allowing for increase manoeuvrability and improved control of UAVs with high degrees of freedom such as highly flexible or morphing wings. © 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

We evaluate the analysis of different imaging methods performed with active laser detection as well as with passive imaging using advanced scenario analysis. In first experimental investigation, we recorded and analyzed image sequences of a MUAV quad-copter flying at low altitude in laboratory and in outdoor scenario. Our results show, that we are able to track the three dimensional flight path with high accuracy and we are able to give a reliable prediction of the MUAV flight behavior within the near future. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Vehicles, could be unmanned aerial vehicles (e.g. drones), share their sensors' information to improve network performance and provide safety, traffic efficiency, and entertainments. The accuracy and reliability of this information are vital for VANET performance. However, misbehaving (or faulty) vehicles, which exploit the cooperativeness feature by sharing bogus information, can disrupt the fundamental operations of any potential application and cause loss of people lives and properties. Unfortunately, existing detection approaches cannot effectively thwart such attacks. The highly dynamic vehicular context has been vastly neglected as well as they rely on predefined and static security perimeters to differentiate between false and correct information. In this paper, a context-aware detection approach is proposed to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the false alarm rate. Firstly, the features that well represent the vehicular context has been extracted. Then, an online unsupervised learning method namely the hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to classify the received messages into either genuine or spurious. Finally, Bayesian-based hypothesis testing has been used to confirm the validity of the classification. Results show that the proposed detection approach is promising in effectively detect bogus information attack and improve applications performance. © 2019 The Authors.

Simultaneously, dramatic improvements in machine learning and deep neural network architectures have enabled unprecedented analytical capabilities, which we see in increasingly common applications and production technologies, such as self-driving vehicles and intelligent mobile applications. Predictably, these technologies have seen rapid adoption, which has left many implementations vulnerable to threats unforeseen or undefended against. Moreover, such technologies can be used by malicious actors, and the potential for cyber threats, attacks, intrusions, and obfuscation that are only just being considered, applied, and countered. In this paper, we consider the good, the bad, and the ugly use of machine learning for cybersecurity and CPS/IoT. In detail, we consider the numerous benefits (good use) that machine learning has brought, both in general, and specifically for security and CPS/IoT, such as the improvement of intrusion detection mechanisms and decision accuracy in CPS/IoT. More pressing, we consider the vulnerabilities of machine learning (bad use) from the perspectives of security and CPS/IoT, including the ways in which machine learning systems can be compromised, misled, and subverted at all stages of the machine learning life-cycle (data collection, pre-processing, training, validation, implementation, etc.). Finally, the most concerning, a growing trend has been the utilization of machine learning in the execution of cyberattacks and intrusions (ugly use).

A comparison between different scenarios for flight within sinusoidal wind profile is presented. A significant improvement in performance with active control of elevator has been found for an energy-harvesting mode when compared to auto-stabilization of fixed-stick flight. Moreover, a detailed decomposition of stochastic wind profile generated from Kaimal spectrum has shown which frequencies and magnitudes contribute mostly to the energy-transfer process. It was found that wind with higher turbulence intensity potentially provides more energy for transfer to the aircraft. Furthermore, the paper reveals biologically inspired sensory system for wind field estimation. It describes the necessary equipment and control algorithms for exploitation of atmospheric energy. Some initial flight tests are performed in order to determine the average power consumption of the motor and evaluate the performance of sensors.

The abolition of smallpox vaccination has led to the disappearance of population immunity to pox viruses. However, the threat of infection by pathogenic orthopoxviruses persists and determines the need to develop sensitive and operational methods for indicating pathogens. Objectives and purposes. Development of a sensitive, fast and easy-to-use immunochemical test for the detection of orthopoxviruses in the «point of care» format. Material and methods. We used preparations of cultural vaccinia virus (VV) with varying degrees of purification, polyclonal antibodies from hyperimmune rabbit serum, and equipment from a previously developed autonomous kit for dot-immunoassay on flat protein arrays. Results and discussion. It has been established that rabbit polyclonal antibodies can be used in a single-stage dot-analysis, both as a capture agent immobilized on a substrate and as a detection reagent bound with colloidal gold particles. It is shown that the effectiveness of the detection of VV is inversely related to the degree of purification of viruses from sub-viral structures. The sensitivity of the rapid detection of viruses in a crude preparation was about 30 times higher than in pure viral material. The increase in sensitivity, presumably, occurs due to binding to the capture antibodies of sub-viral structures, which form large aggregates of sensitized gold particles. The test does not detect cross-reactions with heterogeneous viruses (measles, rubella and chickenpox) that cause exantematous diseases. Conclusion. The one-stage variant of the dot-immunoassay reduces the analysis time to 40 minutes and improves the detection sensitivity of orthopoxviruses in crude viral preparations to the range of 105-104 PFU / ml. Full makeup, ease of analysis and the ability to visually accounting for results allow the test to be used outside of laboratories. © 2019 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

"Design of a water treatment plant of near-zero energy consumption for the autonomous production of drinking water in developing countries","2019","ECOS 2019 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079693658&partnerID=40&md5=1c761ab79c4b5909bc0b61e7f50be71a","The right to drinking water has been and is one of the most important points to boost the quality of life of the human being. The lack of drinking water is one of the major causes of illness and death worldwide. And this threat is critical especially in the rural areas of developing countries, where the access to water is not immediate, and drinking water is still scarcer. The work presented here is intended for regions where a high percentage of the population lacks access to drinking water to meet minimum requirements. This work aims to promote the social and economic development of developing countries through the provision of a sustainable, energy-free service of a simple water treatment plant to guarantee the human right to drinking water. This contribution consists of the design of a simple and robust water treatment plant that will allow a safe and reliable management and production of water treated in regular regime with a portable and autonomous machine with near-zero energy consumption. It is intended that the machine can be built on-site by people in the area, with local materials and suppliers as much as possible. A second benefit is that the trading of the machine should be able to generate wealth and new jobs, generating a small local market. The main features of the designed low energy water treatment machine are the following: (i) it is a lightweight device, under 150kg, and it could be hand-carried, wheeling or carried in a typical van; (ii) it is a limited volume package, with dimensions 1200x1100x1500mm; (iii) its long-lasting life makes it a profitable machine in the long run with a very affordable purified water cost per litre; (iv) it is of easy to build, with a modular structure and universal joint piping; (v) it is self-sustainable and free of energy-supply, as it can work without outer electric energy supply, neither additional pumps or tanks; (vi) versatile as it can run both with electrical supply (when available) and hand-operated. This work could be valuable for development cooperation energy projects and energy emergency situations. © ECOS 2019 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.

However, how to select crowdsourcing workers with performance maximization is prudent and quite challenging since vehicles are highly dynamic and have unpredictable routes. In this paper, we study the worker selection problem for crowdsourced on-route map collection where the trade- off between the real-time worker exploration and exploitation is the main focus. Specifically, by adopting the multi-armed bandit model, we formulate a cumulative platform utility maximization problem. To solve this problem, we propose an Online Worker Selection (OWS) scheme, to learn drivers' performance and make worker selection decisions in real time. Essentially, two key designs are integrated in OWS: 1) performance transfer. If a new driver joins the crowdsourcing, we will initialize the new driver's performance based on the knowledge transferred from the existing drivers' records; and 2) marginal utility. Particularly, we carefully incorporate the platform utility to embody the marginal effect, i.e., repeated coverage by multiple vehicles on a certain road will undermine the utility. Based on the real-world vehicular GPS trace, we conduct extensive trace- driven simulations, and results demonstrate that our scheme can effectively obtain high-quality environment map, with on average 40.5% crowdsourcing utility gain over other benchmark schemes. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

As the formal setting, we use a very general model of Stochastic Systems (an SS is simply a family of time-indexed random variables), and Bounded LTL (BLTL) as the temporal logic. Let S be an SS and ϕ a BLTL formula. Our survey of the area is centered around the following five main contributions. Qualitative approach to SMC: Is the probability that S satisfies ϕ greater or equal to a certain threshold? Quantitative approach to SMC: What is the probability that S satisfies ϕ? Typically this results in a confidence interval being computed for this probability. Rare Events: What happens when the probability that S satisfies ϕ is extremely small, i.e. it is a rare event? To make the SMC approach viable in this setting, rare-event estimation techniques Importance Sampling and Importance Splitting are deployed to great advantage. Optimal Planning: Motivated by the success of Importance Sampling and Importance Splitting in rare-event SMC, we explore the use of these techniques in the context of optimal planning. In particular, we consider ARES, an optimal-planning approach based on a notion of adaptive receding-horizon planning. We illustrate the utility of ARES on the planning problem of bringing a flock of birds (autonomous agents) from a random initial configuration to a V-formation, an energy-conservation formation deployed by migrating geese. Somewhat ironically, the performance of ARES can be evaluated using (quantitative) SMC, as the problem to be solved is of the form F (J ≤ θ); i.e. does an ARES-generated plan eventually bring the flock to a configuration where the flock-wide cost function J is below a given threshold θ? Optimal Control: We show that the techniques we presented for optimal planning in the form of ARES carry over to the control setting in the form of Adaptive-Horizon Model-Predictive Control (AMPC). We again use the V-formation problem for evaluation purposes. We also introduce the concept of V-formation games, and show how the power of AMPC can be used to ward off cyber-physical attacks. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

CPTED components are also utilized for preventing traffic accidents and ensuring pedestrian safety. It is important to take measures to design an environment that does not seem threatening, for example by installing CCTVs in the same color of the building they are being installed on and at an interval of 5 meters at a placement that does not interfere with pedestrians’ walking. In addition to the images taken by unmanned drones, the taken from these CCTVs will be used as well as they are also important for crime prevention.This high-tech security system will allow users to monitor areas vulnerable to crime in real time and strengthen policing activities. Also, it will predict areas at risk of crime and allow users to devise strategies for crime prevention utilizing the Map Data that is constantly collected. Supplementing patrol personnel with unmanned drones will create a more efficient human resources management system as well as minimize blind spots in monitoring by building a tighter security infrastructure. The technology is currently still in its early stages, but if unmanned drones are equipped with effective crime-recognition technology, such a high-tech security system continuously monitoring crime-prone areas in real time, it is likely the system could be established as an effective means of crime prevention in the future. With the technology presented in this paper, it is possible to analyze image patterns under limited conditions to establish a real-time crime prevention environment and to examine an integrated control system that can detect situations that have previously been categorized as a risk. In addition, it is possible to recognize crime as it occurs by analyzing people’s behavioral patterns inside the patrol route of the unmanned drones.It will be possible to prevent crimes to the greatest extent by utilizing various forms of crime prevention facilities such as unmanned drones. This will allow users to check the crime occurrence status in real time and to take appropriate action where needed.

Our results validate that sub-6GHz and mmWave UAVs can be deployed together to complement each other in a multi-tier HetNet where the sub-6GHz tier will enhance the coverage and the mmWave tier will improve the data rates.

We summarize the findings from three of our recent experiments regarding the team interaction within HAT over time in the dynamic context of RPAS. For the first and the second experiments, we summarize general findings related to team member interaction of a three-member team over time, by comparison of HATs with all-human teams. In the third experiment, which extends beyond the first two experiments, we investigate HAT evolution when HATs are faced with three types of failures during the task. For all three of these experiments, measures focus on team interactions and temporal dynamics consistent with the theory of interactive team cognition. We applied Joint Recurrence Quantification Analysis, to communication flow in the three experiments. One of the most interesting and significant findings from our experiments regarding team evolution is the idea of entrainment, that one team member (the pilot in our study, either agent or human) can change the communication behaviors of the other teammates over time, including coordination, and affect team performance. In the first and second studies, behavioral passiveness of the synthetic teams resulted in very stable and rigid coordination in comparison to the all-human teams that were less stable. Experimenter teams demonstrated metastable coordination (not rigid nor unstable) and performed better than rigid and unstable teams during the dynamic task. In the third experiment, metastable behavior helped teams overcome all three types of failures. These summarized findings address three potential future needs for ensuring effective HAT: (1) training of autonomous agents on the principles of teamwork, specifically understanding tasks and roles of teammates, (2) human-centered machine learning design of the synthetic agent so the agents can better understand human behavior and ultimately human needs, and (3) training of human members to communicate and coordinate with agents due to current limitations of Natural Language Processing of the agents. © Demir, McNeese and Cooke.","Article","Final","Scopus"

As the number of small UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) increases rapidly, we need a system which monitors and controls the traffic of UAS to guarantee safe flight of UAS in the general airspace. The system is referred to as the UTM (UAS Traffic Management) system, and it is a very crucial architecture because its collapse results in a lot of monetary losses and even casualties due to collisions and crashes. Because the UTM system consists of computer hardware, computer software, database and communication links, it is very vulnerable to various cyber threats. In this paper, we first categorize components of the UTM system into hardware, software and communication components, and analyze cyber threats of each component respectively. Then, we employ the risk evaluation table of ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) to assess likelihood, impact and risk of possible threats to UTM system.

However, such vehicles operate in complex heterogeneous environments and it is therefore essential to control the dynamic risks that the CAVs face during operation. Given that CAVs can be seriously impacted by cyber-attacks, their security issues have been investigated widely. However, existing approaches fail to adequately consider the dynamicity of the risks that arise and present methods to capture the changes in risks and adaptive mitigations. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes a systematic approach, which comprises of three modules: a knowledge-based system to support the identification of the critical threats, a monitoring module to detect the changes in security context of the CAV and its surrounding environments, and a simplified assessment module to capture the dynamic risks and adjust the mitigations as needed.

In particular, the availability of different mobile network operators (MNOs) can be exploited by the UAVs to steer connection to the MNO ensuring the best quality of experience (QoE). While the concept of traffic steering is more known at the network side, extending it to the device level would allow meeting the emerging requirements of today's applications. In this vein, an efficient steering solutions that take into account the nature and the characteristics of this new type of communication is highly needed. The authors introduce, in this paper, a mechanism for steering the connection in mobile network-enabled UAVs. The proposed solution considers a realistic communication model that accounts for most of the propagation phenomena experienced by wireless signals. Moreover, given the complexity of the related optimization problem, which is inherent from this realistic model, the authors propose a solution based on coalitional game.

Automotive Systems Engineering (ASE) as one approach is increasingly gaining ground in the automotive industry. However, this approach is still in a prototype stage. The consideration of security and safety within the early stages of systems design leads to so-called ill-defined problems. Such are not covered by ASE, but can be addressed by means of Design Thinking. Therefore we introduce an approach to combine both approaches. Based on this combination, we derive potentials in the context of the consideration of security and safety. Essential advantages are the possibility to think ahead of threat scenarios at an early stage in system design. Due to an incomplete database, this is not supported or only partially supported by conventional approaches.

To demonstrate such potentials, in this paper, we investigate two key metrics, namely, flight path control performance, and reduced approach speeds for UAVs based on the F/A-18 High Angle of Attack (HARV) model. The landing control architecture consists of an auto-throttle, a stability augmentation system, glideslope and approach track controllers. The performance of the control model is tested using Monte Carlo simulations under a range of environmental uncertainties including atmospheric turbulence consisting of wind shear, discrete and continuous wind gusts, and carrier airwakes. Realistic deck motion is considered where the standard deck motion time histories under the Systematic Characterization of the Naval Environment (SCONE) program released by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) are used.

In their research, the authors have been working on the development of a new concept of transport from the seabed. The authors have already presented the concept of the principle of operation of an autonomous transport module for transport from the seabed (Filipek and Broda, 2016, 2017, 2018). They designed and constructed a laboratory stand and carried out experiments, the results of which confirmed the applicability of the concept discussed in transport from the seabed. The research also included the determination of the energy source in the transport process and the changes in the average density of the transport module. Three transport concepts from the seabed were also compared in terms of their energy demand. In the next step, the authors addressed the issues of stability of the transport module in the process of immersion and ascent. In the course of these studies, there appeared the necessity of the theoretical examination of mass transfer between the transport module and the environment, which is the subject of this publication. The in-depth analysis of this issue is essential from the point of view of the practical suitability of the module for transporting from the seabed because the course of mass exchange between the transport module and the environment determines the speed of immersion and ascent. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This paper investigates autonomous dynamic soaring maneuvers for a bio-inspired small UAV, which can modify platform configuration through variations in the wingspan. To quantify the benefits achieved through morphing, the optimal soaring trajectories of morphing UAV are compared against fixed span configurations. Three-dimensional point-mass UAV equations of motion and logarithmic wind gradient profile are used to model flight dynamics. Results presented in this paper, indicate 15% lesser wind shear requirement by morphing platform in comparison to their fixed-wing counterparts. This shows that the morphing UAV can perform dynamic soaring in an environment, where fixed configuration UAVs can not, because of lesser wind shear. Apart from this, span morphology reduced drag by 15%, lift requirement by 11% and angle of attack requirement by 20%, whereas increasing the maximum velocity by 6.2%, normalized energies by 9% and improved loitering parameters (approx 10%). The results achieved from this study strongly support the concept of integrating dynamic soaring under morphing conditions and its potential benefits. It is imperative that this investigation will serve as a baseline for the proof of concept that dynamic soaring can be extended to a morphing platform. � 2019 by German Aerospace Center (DLR).

Compared to conventional IMU output, the phase-advanced information provided by angular acceleration measurement is more beneficial for flight stability. This paper presents a general and systematic approach to enhance the attitude stability of small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. The methodology begins by designing a virtual angular accelerometer (VAA), which is based on 4 MEMS IMUs measurement fusion. Then, the angular acceleration is exploited to estimate and compensate disturbances. Finally, an enhanced attitude control scheme is developed to improve attitude tracking performance, where linear or nonlinear control approaches can be adopted. A VAA-based backstepping controller (BS) is designed and its stability is analyzed via Lyapunov function. Three simulation cases are carried out to verify the performance of tracking accuracy, robustness, and disturbance rejection. PID and backstepping methods are applied to the scheme. As a comparison, a widely used nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO)-based robust controller (RC) is studied. The simulation results show the excellent performance of the sensor-based VAA to observe the fast time-varying disturbance, where the NDO causes the time delay and phase lag. The tracking accuracy of the enhanced controllers (PID+VAA, BS+VAA, and RC+VAA), compared to the basic controllers, are improved by 14.3%-93.7% and the closed-loop control systems gain notable robustness. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The capability of estimating the likelihood that a monitored industrial machine will successfully conclude a predefined workload, considering both the available historical data from sensors and the workload itself, may be crucial in supporting the new scheduling activities of an Industry 4.0 manufacturing plant. In this paper, we propose a first data-driven prognostic for the battery State-Of-Charge (SOC) assessment concerning a predefined machine workload. After the introduction of a DC Motor Equivalent Circuit for the testbed, the proposed methodology exploits a machine learning model approach through the use of an Artificial Neural Network for the degradation assessment of the battery monitoring equipment. The presented work intends to be preparatory for the future integration of the State-Of-Health (SOH) information within the scheduling decision, without facing a particular scheduling problem.

During spraying operation, strong downwash airflow of UAVs can ensure the penetration of droplets to crop canopies so as to obtain a satisfactory effect. Therefore, this paper focuses on the CFD models of the downwash airflow of an eight-rotor UAV, AGRAS MG-1. In the study, SolidWorks was used to develop and assemble the model of the UAV and then calculate the CFD results of the downwash airflow. For simulation domains, a computational domain and eight rotating domains were partitioned. Moreover, meshes were constructed automatically. In terms of the verification of the CFD models, several trials were conducted and the distribution of the droplets sprayed from the nozzles under the UAV was exploited to represent the downwash airflow. Furthermore, ultraviolet lights and the ultraviolet-visible tracer, Sodium Fluorescein with Tinopal CBS-x, were applied. Results illustrated that the crucial characteristics of CFD models coincided with that of the trials, containing the section of stable flowing, the position of turbulence and the analysis of ground effect. The study offers a method of verification of downwash airflow, able to be applied in other similar tests. © 2019 ASABE Annual International Meeting.

Therefore, it is increasingly important to find unknown drones quickly and accurately. In UAV detection, the technologies based on acoustic, radio and radar detection are common, but these technologies usually require expensive equipment and strict configuration. However, the method based on machine vision has the advantages of low cost and simple configuration. In addition, detection and recognition methods based on deep learning have been fully developed, but most of them are for a single visible image, and the detection and recognition effect is limited. In this paper, a fast detection and identification method based is proposed based on the backbone of YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version3). And dual-channel detectors were used as data sources. In this method, infrared and visible images are simultaneously input into the network for feature extraction, and the extracted depth features are concatenated. Then the multi-scale prediction network is used to regression the target location to obtain the final detection and recognition results. Finally, by collecting real UAV data sets, the network is trained and tested for comparative experiments.

To this end, we propose the use of radio map that provides the information on the large-scale channel gains between each GBS and uniformly sampled locations on a three- dimensional (3D) grid over the region of interest, which are assumed to be time-invariant due to the generally static and large-size obstacles therein (e.g., buildings). Based on the given radio maps of the GBSs, we first obtain the optimal UAV path by solving an equivalent shortest path problem (SPP) in graph theory. To reduce the computation complexity of the optimal solution, we further propose a grid quantization method whereby the grid points in each GBS's radio map are more coarsely sampled by exploiting the spatial channel correlation over neighboring grids. Then, we solve the approximate SPP over the reduced-size radio map (graph) more efficiently. Numerical results show that the proposed solutions can effectively minimize the flying distance of the UAV subject to its communication quality constraint. Moreover, a flexible trade-off between performance and complexity can be achieved by adjusting the quantization ratio for the radio map. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Therefore, a collision between such sUAV and manned aircraft is becoming ever more likely. There are legal requirements (allowable mass, prohibited flight zones, height restrictions) to hobby pilots, which should minimize the probability and resulting consequences of an impact. Recent occurences have shown that these restrictions are either not adhered to or are insufficient. Sharing the same airspace, rotorcraft in particular, are prone to such impact scenarios. Within this paper different scenarios between those aircrafts are defined. The resulting consequences to the rotorcraft structure are determined by analytical approaches and engineering judgement. In order to fully characterize the threat of a drone strike to manned rotorcraft, a test and simulation program is developed and will be carried out in the scope of the research project “Drone strike on aircraft research” – DESIRE. The project will run from Oct. 2018 to May 2022. The test results can be used as basic data for further evaluation and actions. Within this paper the complete program is presented including the extended building block approach with planned testing efforts. First results of performed testing efforts describe the behavior of drone motors upon compression loading. Correlation between finite element simulations and test results enable a comprehensive build up of complete impact scenarios to support further investigations.

It is very important that every person in the community knows about BLS to save lives and improve the quality of community health. Aim: The aim of our study is to assess the awareness and knowledge about BLS among dental students. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted by assessing responses to 20 selected questions pertaining to BLS among dental students through survey planet among 102 dental students. A questionnaire is regarding the knowledge and attitude toward BLS. The results were analyzed using an answer key prepared from the advanced cardiac life support manual. Results: About 31% of the students have an average knowledge about BLS and 17% has a good knowledge and 15% has an excellent knowledge on BLS and 37% of them have very poor knowledge on BLS. Conclusion: The awareness and knowledge regarding BLS is inadequate among dental students. Spreading awareness and teaching the basics of advanced life support to the medical and paramedical team as well as teaching BLS and first aid to the community will be the prime responsibility of this new emergency specialty, and also, by introducing BLS regularly in the academic curriculum and by routine hands-on workshops, all the health-care providers should be well versed with the BLS skills for effectively managing the life-threatening emergencies. © 2019 JPR Solutions.

Assuming a low-altitude UAV, we derive connection probability, secrecy outage probability, instantaneous secrecy rate, and average secrecy rate of the proposed protocol over Air-Ground channels, which are modeled as Rician fading with elevation-angel dependent parameters. Further, we analyze the asymptotic average secrecy rate performance of the proposed UAV-relaying scheme and derive high signal-to-noise ratio measures of the average secrecy rate to highlight the effect of various channel features on the system performance.

Particularly, the secondary IoT devices opportunistically accesses the radio resource provided by a primary network and directly transmits short packets to the mobile UAV. A novel performance metric is proposed with finite block-length codes is adopted in the secondary UAV-aided IoT network. We aim to maximize the minimum average finite block-length rate for the secondary UAV-aided IoT network, subject to a probabilistic interference power constraint to the primary network based on imperfect channel state information (CSI). This formulated problem is non-convex due to the binary time scheduling, the power allocation, and the UAV altitude. In order to circumvent this issue, we develop an alternating method to solve this problem. Specifically, we first exploit the time scheduling optimization of the IoT devices for given power allocation and UAV altitude. Next, the monotonicity of the average finite block-length rate is analyzed to gain more insights for given time scheduling and UAV altitude. By capitalizing on this property, an optimal power control policy is proposed, followed by closed-form expressions and approximations for the optimal average power and the achievable average rate in the finite block- length regime. The optimal altitude of the UAV can be obtained by one-dimensional line search. Numerical results validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the derived theoretical results. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Is our dignity, and accordingly also our sense of dignity under threat in elderly care, especially in robotic care? How can robotic care support or challenge human dignity in elderly care? The answer will depend on whether it is robot-based, robot-assisted, or teleoperated care that is at stake. Further, the demands and realizations of human dignity have to be distinguished. The demands to respect humans are based on human dignity and the inalienable high and equal moral standing that everyone has. For human moral agents, these demands take the form of negative and positive duties. For robots, they arguably take the form of corresponding ought-to-be norms. The realizations of dignity consist in variable responses to these demands, by oneself by others, and by society at large. This article examines how robot-based, robot-assisted, and teleoperated care can amount to realizations of dignity. The varieties of robotic care can, in different ways, be responsive to the demands of dignity and recognize humans as vulnerable beings with needs, as autonomous agents, and as rational subjects of experience, emotion, and thought. © 2019 Philosophy Documentation Center.

Specifically, secure transmission is required for MUs to combat eavesdropping attacks and a desired successful transmission probability should be ensured for INs to receive the public instruction massages. To improve the secrecy rates (SRs) for MUs, we consider an eavesdropper-free area, i.e., protected zone, surrounding the UAV. With non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for MUs, the power allocation to each MU is optimized to maximize the minimum secrecy rate of MUs within the protected zone, under the constraints of successful receiving probability requirements for INs. To solve this problem, we first prove that the max-min SR can be obtained when SRs of all users are equal, and then a dichotomy-based successive power allocation policy is proposed. Numerical results show that higher max-min secrecy rate can be achieved by our proposed power allocation policy than the traditional policy. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

One of the objectives of safe practices was the need for prevention and control of pain in adults and children, including management of the same in quality standards. At the Germans Trias and Pujol University Hospital (HUGTIP) in 2016, the development of the indicators that were intended to be evaluated for better detection and therapeutic efficiency of acute in-hospital pain in any area ended with the design and creation of what we call as “Pain map”. The objective was to design a tool that, through the clinical pain variable, could improve the visualization of pain and extract statistical data from the defined indicators for optimal pain management in a university hospital of the third level. Material and method: Descriptive analysis of the tool we call ""Pain map"" at the Germans Trias and Pujol University Hospital during 2016. The population was all patients admitted to hospital units where the pain registry was made through the GacelaCare® computerized medical record. The main variable was the recording of pain intensity using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) or Numeric Verbal Scale (NVA) by nursing shift considering pain as the 5th constant. The tool creation procedure was carried out with the collaboration of the hospital information systems department together with members of the Pain Unit for the elaboration of the so-called pain map. Results: The ""Pain map"" is based on the previous action required by nursing which is the recording of the intensity of pain using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) or Numerical Verbal Scale (NVA) in turn considering pain as the 5th constant. The map allows to visualize on the screen the registers of the pain intensity of all hospitalized patients simultaneously and in real time. The ""Pain map"" identifies with different colors as a traffic light of pain. In green color, the EVN values are between 0-3 (mild pain), orange EVN between 4 and 6 (moderate pain) and red color between 7 and 10 (intense pain). Likewise, it indicates with a purple band those patients operated on the previous day, facilitating pain control during the first 24 postoperative hours. The statistical exploitation of computerized pain registers allows obtaining results of the quality indicators related to pain management defined by our hospital. Discussion: The ""Pain map"" is an innovative tool that allows the development of low-cost Acute Pain Units to be guaranteed with efficiency. © 2019 Ediciones Doyma, S.L..

Small debris or MMOD may not pose so much threat to small and big satellites, however they are a death sentence for cube-sat. Our goal is to achieve space-based observations of the orbital debris environment. Among more than 10000+ objects larger than 10 cm in Earth orbits, only about 6% are operational satellites and the remaining are space debris. Ground based operators tracks these objects with radars and optical telescopes to determine their orbits and other characteristic parameters, including their sizes. Currently, there are more than 20,000 large-sized space debris which are trackable from Earth, along with an estimated number of over 750,000 smaller debris which are unable to be tracked.[1] LPUSAT-1, a nanosatellite carrying a scientific payload to map the unmapped space debris in LEO, as a very little advancement is done to capture phase-space information of such debris. It is an attempt to use remote sensing technology in space using a debris detector on-board a cube-sat, demonstrating efficient and effective technological advances in power and detection that are the cornerstone of many other developments in the space industry. The mission will contribute to the global effort of cataloguing small sized orbital debris, and to improve safety for future manned and unmanned space missions. In this paper a careful research and calculations has been made for a cube-sat size, specifications and the designs to handle a space-based debris monitoring payload. The science mission requirements fortunately allow adoption of the economical CubeSat form factor. The major subsystems comprising the satellite are being developed by the team. Innovation systems include power distribution system, thermal control system and the payload design demonstrating how CubeSats can take over the duties reserved for bigger satellites. On other topic, the data generated by this mission will be of enormous importance for space navigation for both public and private institutions and will demonstrate technologies affordable to other similar missions in the future.

Although quantum computing is still in its infancy, experiments have been carried out and proto-types have been developed, showing promising results for future commercial applications [3] [4] [5] [6]. Research in both theoretical and practical areas continues at a frantic pace, and many national governments, research institutions and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum computers for both civilian and national security purposes, such as cryptanalysis, genetics, drugs and disease research, materials science and design and so on [2].

On-board cyber-security, satellite AI, advanced autonomous life support systems for human exploration are only few of the domains which could be dramatically boosted by the availability of this technology. The paper discusses an early study about an experimentation of a quantum computer in orbit as a first step for a future fully qualified flight-ready payload. It discusses the major benefits of a flight experimentation, focusing on the one hand on the objectives and the expected benefits that it will bring to the development of the space borne and on-ground technology, on the other hand on the open questions like the effect of microgravity on the architecture of this technology. It analyses the currently available implementation solutions of quantum computers on ground which are currently prototyped (e.g. IBM Q System One), and provides early results on the identified main technical aspects to be considered to improve the technology readiness level. It highlights the most important challenges to be considered in the design and the added value that the space environment will bring as scientific feedback.

The combat system of systems (SoS) presents the characteristics of multifunctional combat equipment and hybrid manned and unmanned force units. At present, the research of mission planning is mostly oriented to a single factor, does not consider a variety of operational activities. Therefore, how to describe the hybrid operational organization of multiple functions and force units and to accomplish mission planning for various operational activities has very practical significance. In this paper, the FINC(Force, Intelligence, Networking, C2) model is extended, a new model framework of unmanned combat force with the function of integrated observe and attack is proposed, which is called Force Intelligent Network Command and Control Model with autonomous platform (FINCA). Four types and eight different function chains are proposed for the hybrid Combat SoS. Through the capability requirements and resource constraints, the operational tasks are mapped to the types and quantities of function chains that needed to accomplish this task, and the multi-priority list dynamic reconstruction scheme (MPLDCS) method is used to generate the function chain planning scheme. The many-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-III is improved, let mission execution time, connection change induced consumption, and the real-time remaining number of UAV composed the objective function to find all possible Pareto front.

The indirect communication over New Radio (NR) is expected to benefit the overall reliability especially for vehicles, which are not in close vicinity and widen the service coverage that is essential for highly automated, safety- related, cooperative driving scenarios. However, this may come at the cost of high complexity and increasing end-to-end (e2e) latency compared to direct Vehicular-to-Vehicular (V2V) communication. Our proposal aims to exploit the benefits of both indirect and direct communication, by employing localized e2e paths. A key challenge is how to optimize the uplink, downlink and wireless backhaul (BH) constituents of a local path in order to ensure e2e Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for V2X services in multi-cell environments. To this end, we propose a framework, which decouples a dynamic path- tailored Time Division Duplex (TDD) configuration scheme from a sub-gradient utility optimization method for balancing the resources between BH and access links, based on partial dual decomposition. Numerical results based on a realistic system level simulation setup show significant gains in both e2e reliability, latency as well as V2V path rate, over the benchmark solutions. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

IoT devices serve as bridges for the cyber system to interact with the physical environment by providing various useful sensing capabilities such as battlefield surveillance, home monitoring, traffic control, etc. These capabilities also make IoT an important role in tactical missions in the military, including Reconnaissance, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RISTA). Nevertheless, IoT devices are known to have critical issues on security due to constraints on cost and resources. Most existing researches are based on smart sensors that have comparatively more computing and communication resources, while security solutions for dumb sensors are still lacking. Some IoT sensors that are deployed in a hostile environment are dumb due to limitations on cost and power supply, making them more vulnerable to attacks. In this work, we try to tackle this problem by proposing effective authentication solutions between a UAV and dumb IoT devices (also referred to as dumb sensors) within an example application of a UAV-sensor collaborative RISTA mission. We present two different schemes for two-way mutual authentication between the UAV and dumb sensors which utilize non-cryptographic physical layer cover channel and neighboring devices' signal sensing correlations respectively.

In such situations, it is important for the UAV to indicate a new channel to the BS. This paper describes a method of creating spatial codes that map the chosen channel to the motion and location of the UAVs in space, wherein the latter physically traverses the space from a given so called ''constellation point'' to another. These points create patterns in the sky, analogous to modulation constellations in classical wireless communications, and are detected at the BS through a millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar sensor. A constellation point represents a distinct n-bit field mapped to a specific channel, allowing simultaneous frequency switching at both ends without any RF transmissions. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) We conduct experimental studies to demonstrate how such constellations may be formed using COTS UAVs and mmWave sensors, given realistic sensing errors and hovering vibrations, (ii) We develop a theoretical framework that maps a desired constellation design to error and band switching time, considering again practical UAV movement limitations, and (iii) We experimentally demonstrate jamming resilient communications and validate system goodput for links formed by UAV-mounted software defined radios. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This issue limits their deployability on ubiquitous applications requiring a high level of security such as driverless system, unmanned aerial vehicle and intrusion detection. In this paper, we propose latent encodings transferring attack (LET-attack) to generate target natural adversarial examples to fool well-trained classifiers. In order to perturb in latent space, we train WGAN-variants on various datasets to achieve feature extraction, image reconstruction and image discrimination against counterfeit with good performance. Thanks to our two-stage procedure of mapping transformation, the adversary performs precise and semantic perturbations on source data referring to target data in latent space. By using the critic in WGAN-variant and the well-trained classifier, the adversary crafts more verisimilar and effective adversarial examples. As shown in the experimental results on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10 and LSUN, LET-attack can yield a distinct set of adversarial examples with partly data manifold targeted transfer and attains similar attack performance against state-of-the-art models in different attack scenarios.

In order to reduce the workload of cardiologists and accelerate diagnosis, an automated patient-specific heartbeat classification method based on a customized convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed in this paper. The parallel convolutional layers with kernels of different receptive fields in the network are responsible for extracting multi-spatial deep features of the heartbeats, and the channel-wise attention module is adopted to selectively emphasize the informative features, which are beneficial to distinguish different classes of beats. To facilitate the extraction and emphasis of the important features, each heartbeat is segmented and stacked to form the multi-channel network input according to the basic temporal characteristics of the main components (P wave, QRS complex, and T wave) in the ECG. Besides, to further improve the network generalization and achieve better performance on various ECG of new patients, a method of intra-record sample clustering is proposed to select the representative heartbeats to construct the training set. The proposed method classifies heartbeats into five classes (normal beat (N), supraventricular ectopic beat (SVEB), ventricular ectopic beat (VEB), fusion beat (F), and unclassifiable beat (Q)). Validated on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, our approach demonstrates performance superior to several state-of-the-art methods. In addition to an average accuracy and specificity of over 99%, this method achieves a sensitivity of 95.4% and a positive predictivity of 97.1% for VEB class, and a sensitivity of 81.1% and a positive predictivity of 90.0% for SVEB class.

In this paper, we propose a new base station (BS) cooperative beamforming (CB) technique for the cellular downlink to mitigate the strong interference caused by the co-channel terrestrial transmissions to the UAV. Besides the conventional CB by cooperatively transmitting the UAV's message, the serving BSs of the UAV exploit a novel CB-based {it textbf{interference transmission}} scheme to effectively suppress the terrestrial interference to the UAV. Specifically, the co-channel terrestrial users' messages are shared with the UAV's serving BSs and transmitted via CB so as to cancel their resultant interference at the UAV receiver. To optimally balance between the CB gains for UAV signal enhancement and terrestrial interference cancellation, we formulate a new problem to maximize the UAV's receive signal-to-interference- plus-noise ratio (SINR) by jointly optimizing the power allocations at all of its serving BSs for transmitting the UAV's and co-channel terrestrial users' messages. First, we derive the closed-form optimal solution to this problem in the special case of one serving BS for the UAV and draw useful insights.

The final aim is to track the AUV along a significant set of imposed underwater trajectories and to exploit the collected dataset for identification of vehicle dynamic parameters. In the framework of this activity, the DoA sensors are Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) devices moored in fixed positions on the sea bottom of the operational area. Measurements obtained by these devices are referred to a local frame. In order to express them in a global frame, an accurate estimation of devices pose (position and attitude) is necessary. Direct measurement of the pose is usually not easy as the USBL devices are typically deployed by hand from a Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB). Attitude may be estimated by an integrated Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) but may be affected by unpredictable magnetic disturbances. The calibration procedure aims at determining the pose of the involved USBL devices exploiting acoustic measurements collected when the AUV is on the surface and the GPS signal is available. It has a twofold goal: on one hand, the global-frame measurement errors due to devices pose error estimation are minimised; on the other hand statistics on the expected tracking error, for the particular configuration, are derived to characterise the future identification process. © 2019.

Soundscape methods are especially important near airports and highways, where sound affects the quality of life and health. Soundscape methods are also used for security as they can detect gunfire, sounds of human abnormal behaviors and threats of terrorism, crime, riots, and animal sounds. Current soundscape approaches use stationary microphones and microphone arrays that have been limited to small areas. The application of microphone arrays installed on Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) can provide fast and low-cost soundscape of large areas. We present the results of our initial investigations of two systems: a four-microphone recording system installed on a Multirotor DJI S1000 and a two-microphone compact system installed on a Parrot Disco FPV fixed-wing drone. In the field test with DJI S1000, the cross-correlation method for direction finding of a source of sound allows the detection and tracking of a speaker producing noise with a level of 94 dBA at 1 m at a distance of about 10 m. Fixed wing drones are quieter and more suitable for studying the soundscape. They produce stable harmonics during the flight that can be filtered out for soundscape measurements. The sound pressure level measured by its microphones was about 72 dBA and drops down to 62 dBA when discrete harmonics were removed. The additional signal processing can decrease this self-noise level. The Parrot can provide sound recording during gliding, when the motor noise is absent. The presented preliminary research shows the applicability of using low-cost and low-noise UAS for studying noise © Proceedings of the 26th International Congress on Sound and Vibration, ICSV 2019.

In this context, advances in real-time telemetry platforms allowing to continuously monitor the current performance of an optical channel can avoid the traditional provisioning with end-of-life (EoL) margins, which is characterized by imposing margins large enough to account for worst-case performance degradation profiles (e.g. due to ageing) during network operation. Reducing these margins when provisioning an optical channel, can enable to operate it at higher capacity (e.g. using a higher order modulation format), thereby decreasing capital expenditures (CapEx). However, effectively adopting a more aggressive provisioning strategy requires a sophisticated multi-layer framework to address the higher likelihood that traffic demands might have a longer time to live than that of the optical channel carrying them. This paper exploits the joint availability of real-time performance monitoring platforms and OTN switching technology in order to develop a complete framework to provision services with reduced margins while proactively minimizing the utilization of optical channels that are approaching the performance limit, preventing traffic disruption. The simulation results highlight the benefits of adopting the proposed framework regarding the overall network performance and line interface count. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Different from prior works considering the two-dimensional (2D) horizontal trajectory design in the non-CoMP scenario, this paper additionally exploits the UAV's vertical trajectory (or altitude) control for further improving the secrecy communication performance with CoMP. In particular, we jointly optimize the three dimensional (3D) trajectory and transmit power allocation of the UAV to maximize the average secrecy rate at GNs over a particular flight period, subject to the UAV's maximum flight speed and maximum transmit power constraints. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose an alternating-optimization-based approach, which optimizes the transmit power allocation and trajectory design in an alternating manner, by convex optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA), respectively. Numerical results show that in the scenario with CoMP reception, our proposed 3D trajectory optimization significantly outperforms the conventional 2D horizontal trajectory design, by exploiting the additional degree of freedom in vertical trajectory. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Establishing critical quality attributes (CQAs) and critical process parameters (CPPs) is a crucial task for ensuring the potency, safety, and consistency of this therapy. To better understand these therapies, a design of experiments evaluating the expansion of T cells was carried out. Through a supervised learning approach, multi-omics predictors (i.e. secretomes and NMR metabolomics features) can be used to understand T cell behavior based on growth and memory responses. The purpose of this work is to develop a computational pipeline that enables the characterization of multi-omics profiles that are predictive of quality responses at early stages of the manufacturing process. This includes the design of a computational tool that will measure the predictive power of omics variables and the sensitivity of these models to highly correlated predictors. The computational tool has been developed using mathematical modeling and machine learning techniques such as Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Symbolic Regression (SR). A consensus measurement between the different models was used in order to identify potential CQAs and CPPs. The biological meaning of these features is then assessed through discussions with the domain experts. A degree of consensus was achieved throughout the models in identifying important variables when modeling the percentage of T cells that are CCR7+CD62L+CD4+ (CD4_memory_fraction). The models presented high prediction performance with R2 ranging from 75% to 95% where SVM and SR provided the least and best prediction performance, respectively. The ranking of important features from these best-performing models can be misleading if these features are highly correlated. Hence, to mitigate the computational impact of highly correlated predictors, an approach involving the clustering of these variables is proposed before the model fitting process. Preliminary results showed that not only was this methodology able to rank groups of correlated predictors but was also able to improve performance for RF models. The findings of this work could enable the discovery of new knowledge necessary to achieve scalable biomanufacturing of CAR-T cell therapies in an automated manner. © 2019, IEOM Society International.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Airborne Detect-and-Avoîd (ABDAA) and counter-UAS technologies have similar sensing requirements to detect and track airborne threats, albeit for different purposes: To avoid a collision or to neutralize a threat, respectively. These systems typically include a variety of sensors, such as electro-optical or infrared (EO/IR) cameras, RADAR, or LiDAR, and they fuse the data from these sensors to detect and track a given threat and to predict its trajectory. Camera imagery can be an effective method for detection as well as for pose estimation and threat classification, though one cannot resolve range to a threat from a single camera image without additional information, such as knowledge of the threat geometry. To support ABDAA and counter-UAS applications, we consider a merger of two image-based sensing methods that mimic human vision: (1) a “peripheral vision” camera (i.e., with a fisheye lens) to provide a large field-of-view and (2) a “central vision55 camera (i.e., with a perspective lens) to provide high resolution imagery of a specific target. Beyond the complementary ability of the two cameras to support detection and classification, the pair form a heterogeneous stereo vision system that can support range resolution.

High angle of attack operation of ducted fans is very common in VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) UAV systems. The new concept that will significantly reduce the inlet lip separation related performance penalties in the edgewise/forward flight zone is named DOUBLE-DUCTED FAN (DDF). The current concept uses a secondary stationary duct system to control inlet lip separation related momentum deficit at the inlet of the fan rotor occurring at elevated edgewise flight velocities. The DDF is self-adjusting in a wide edgewise flight velocity range and its corrective aerodynamic effect becomes more pronounced with increasing flight velocity due to its inherent design properties. In this manuscript, after a comprehensive discussion of VTOL inlet flow distortion issues, a conventional baseline duct without any lip separation control feature is compared to two different double-ducted fans named DDF CASE-A and DDF CASE-B via 3D, viscous and turbulent flow computational analysis. Both hover and edgewise flight conditions are considered. Significant relative improvements from DDF CASE-A and DDF CASE-B are in the areas of vertical force (thrust) enhancement, nose-up pitching moment control and recovery of fan through-flow mass flow rate in a wide horizontal flight range. © Open Archives of the 16th International Symposium on Transport Phenomena and Dynamics of Rotating Machinery, ISROMAC 2016.

The physical properties of this important connective tissue known to vary, has potential application as a point of care device to assess the health of the populace in resource limited settings such as the Indian sub-continent. Indeed, vascular diseases are known to induce variations in the rheological attributes of blood stains. Taken together with inherent variances in the genetic base across the Indian sub-continent, we believe that the correlation of the variances in rheological properties of blood could be used effectively for preliminary screening of a health status of a community using minimally invasive techniques and hence can be prospected as a tool for low end affordable healthcare technologies. The simple point of care device developed by our group consists of a simple, robust and low-cost micro-fluidic device comprising of a micro-capillary viscometer attached to a pendant drop tensiometer, designed and fabricated to measure the viscosity, surface tension and wettability gradient of blood samples.

In electronic warfare systems, the source estimation is important for better surveillance and planning of military strategies. Among the various approaches of Time Difference of Arrival, Three Dimensional Time Difference of Arrival algorithms have drawn much attention as it does not require synchronization between emitter and the base stations and also provides better estimation performance. However, it certainly requires synchronization among the receiving base stations. In this paper an algorithm is proposed for source localization using Three Dimensional Time Difference of Arrival in presence of multipath scenario and clock bias in the receiving base stations. Most of the existing techniques require range data for obtaining the closed form Time Difference of Arrival solution. The algorithm presented in this paper is based on Ezzat’s closed form solution, which does not depend on range data. Simulations are carried out and performance is evaluated by placing receivers on ship/land and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle platforms. Standard deviation in estimated Three Dimensional Time Difference of Arrival is measured using cross correlation between the signals and a closed form solution is obtained.

This paper introduces a media transmission scheme in the UAV-aided network utilizing reinforcement learning algorithms to efficiently process and transmit the captured video, which is able to improve the quality-of-experience (QoE) and reduce the energy consumption. Exploiting the proposed reinforcement learning algorithm, the UAV dynamically selects the quantization parameter in the source coding process and determines the transmit power without knowing the video transmission model.

We focus on two problems: searching for scenarios when learned agents fail and assessing their probability of failure. The standard method for agent evaluation in reinforcement learning, Vanilla Monte Carlo, can miss failures entirely, leading to the deployment of unsafe agents. We demonstrate this is an issue for current agents, where even matching the compute used for training is sometimes insufficient for evaluation. To address this shortcoming, we draw upon the rare event probability estimation literature and propose an adversarial evaluation approach. Our approach focuses evaluation on adversarially chosen situations, while still providing unbiased estimates of failure probabilities. The key difficulty is in identifying these adversarial situations - since failures are rare there is little signal to drive optimization. To solve this we propose a continuation approach that learns failure modes in related but less robust agents. Our approach also allows reuse of data already collected for training the agent. We demonstrate the efficacy of adversarial evaluation on two standard domains: humanoid control and simulated driving. Experimental results show that our methods can find catastrophic failures and estimate failures rates of agents multiple orders of magnitude faster than standard evaluation schemes, in minutes to hours rather than days. © 7th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2019.

Achieving their fast travel and low motion energy without inter-UAV collision under wind perturbation is a daunting control task, which incurs huge communication energy for exchanging UAV states in real time. We tackle this problem by exploiting a mean-field game (MFG) theoretic control method that requires the UAV state exchanges only once at the initial source. Afterwards, each UAV can control its acceleration by locally solving two partial differential equations (PDEs), known as the Hamilton-Jacobi- Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations. This approach, however, brings about huge computation energy for solving the PDEs, particularly under multi-dimensional UAV states. We address this issue by utilizing a machine learning (ML) method where two separate ML models approximate the solutions of the HJB and FPK equations. These ML models are trained and exploited using an online gradient descent method with low computational complexity. Numerical evaluations validate that the proposed ML aided MFG theoretic algorithm, referred to as emph{MFG learning control}, is effective in collision avoidance with low communication energy and acceptable computation energy. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Two rotatable duct-fans, which are driven by a turboshaft engine placed inside the fuselage, are installed at the center of the box-wing configuration symmetrically. The existence of the duct between the two wings diminishes the detrimental aerodynamic interaction of the fan blades and the wings. The power requirements of VTOL mode and cruise mode are satisfied through the rotation of duct-fans. Steady numerical simulations of the fundamental box-wing configuration without duct-fans are carried out to optimize lift-to-drag ratio. In the research of the configuration with duct-fans, the momentum source method is used to simulate the flow field characteristics around the duct-fans to uncover the aerodynamic characteristic of the conceptual design. The maximum and minimum velocity within the range of attack angle during the transition flight phase are given to ascertain corridor curves of transition mode. Numerical results demonstrate that, the conceptual design has strong longitudinal stability and low stall speed in horizonal flight and the transition phase is stable and controllable. Meanwhile, changing the direction and value of the duct-fan thrust properly can improve the aerodynamic characteristics of the UAV and generate an effective direct force control. The conceptual design can achieve an excellent flight performance through an optimal control strategy. © 2019 by German Aerospace Center (DLR).

Although the UAV technology matures and the demand market grows, the instability and the unreliability of UAVs have remained as unresolved issues. Moreover, there have been multifaceted researches breaking the reliability of UAVs by means of the cyber-physical attack such as hacking and the sensor malfunction. In this paper, we address several types of the cyber-physical attack models and their detailed mechanisms. From the observations, we propose a system design that detects these cyber-physical attacks and handle the malfunction of single or multi-UAV management system. Our design is composed of the general multi-UAV control framework as a backend, and the individually modularized defense methods against a variety of cyber-physical attacks, such as cryptosystem, sensor monitoring, and fault-tolerance communication. For the cryptosystem, existing encryption methods defending the cyber-attacks can significantly impair the throughput and mission success ratio of the UAVs due to the resource limitation of the UAV. We designed a low-cost real-time authentication method and a variable key length cryptography for the secure UAV network. Some physical attacks falsifying sensor data (i.e., GPS spoofing) are difficult for an UAV alone to detect. To resolve the problem, we address the data consistency monitoring system based on sharing the flight status of UAVs. Finally, we integrate our novel methods into a complete cyber-security detection and response system, which can improve the robustness and reliability of a single or multi-UAV control system. © 2019 The Vertical Flight Society.

Cameras and instruments onboard orbiters have enabled global mapping of Mars at low spatial resolution (~ 1km). Landers and rovers such as the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) carry state-of-the-art instruments to extensively characterize small localized areas. This leaves a critical gap in exploration capabilities: a mesoscale view mapping regions with one meter-scale resolution over hundreds of kilometers. A high science return/low cost solution is to deploy one or more sailplanes in the Martian atmosphere as secondary payloads deployed during Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) of a MSL-class vehicle. These are packaged into 12U/24kg CubeSats, occupying some of the 190 kg of available ballasts. Sailplanes extend inflatable-wings to soar without power limitations by exploiting atmospheric features such as thermal updrafts for static soaring, and wind gradients for dynamic soaring. Such flight patterns have been proven effective on Earth, and demonstrated similarities between Earth and Mars show strong potential for a long lasting airborne science platform on Mars. The maneuverability of sailplanes offer distinct advantages over other exploration vehicles: they provide continuous reconnaissance of areas of interest from multiple viewpoints and altitudes with dedicated science instruments, achieving higher pixel-scale resolutions than orbital assets and enabling exploration capabilities over rugged terrain such as Valles Marineris, steep crater walls and the Martian highlands that remain inaccessible for the foreseeable future due to current EDL technology limitations. In this paper, we extend our work on CubeSat-sized sailplanes with detailed design studies of different aircraft configurations and payloads, identifying generalized design principles for autonomous sailplane-based surface reconnaissance and science applications. We further analyze potential wing deployment technologies, including conventional inflatables with hardened membranes, use of composite inflatables, and quick-setting foam. We study two environments including canyon soaring over Valles Marineris and at Jerezo crater, the landing site for NASA's 2020 rover. Possible flight patterns at Jerezo crater are identified using the Mars Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (MRAMS) to provide realistic atmospheric conditions. We revisit the feasibility of the Mars Sailplane concept, comparing it to previously proposed solutions, and identifying pathways to build laboratory prototypes for high-altitude Earth based testing.

The increase of Cloud users and their interactions with the Cloud infrastructure raise the risk of resources faults. Such a problem can lead to a bad reputation of the Cloud environment, which slows down the evolution of this paradigm. The dynamic architecture and the complex system of the Cloud should be taken into account, hi fact, this paradigm Cloud requires that resources protection and healing must be effective, transparent and without external intervention. Thus, it is essential the use fundamental aspects of autonomic Computing in the Cloud to deal with the self-healing of Cloud security. The high degree of match between autonomic Computing systems and multi-agent systems permit to create an intelligent architecture Cloud that support autonomic aspects. Therefore, we propose a cooperative framework based on Hybrid intrusion detection system (Hy-IDS), mobile Agents and Firewall, which permit to detect both insider and outsider attacks with high detection accuracy in Cloud environment, hi this paper, we propose a Cloud Computing framework offering the access security, ease of resources management using mobile agents and service availability in a reliable structure with lower cost. © 2019 The Authors.

Nowadays DTMs and DSMs can be easily obtained by image-based matching using low altitude aerial dataset acquired from a digital camera by means of a lifting device. In recent years, the spread of commercial multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles and their decreasing cost made low-altitude aerial photography even easier than before, where balloons, kites and telescopic masts would have been used instead. However, the use of drones is often forbidden by law, especially in the archaeological areas, and therefore a more traditional approach must to be adopted instead. This paper presents two different approaches adopted on the field to acquire the DTM of an archaeological excavation: the use of a pole held by a chest harness to lift a camera up to 3,5m height fitted with a 20mm wide angle lens; and a second solution that exploits ground-based fisheye photogrammetry. In general, an image network acquired from ground level is challenging due to: i) the poor coverage that can be obtained on the ground, ii) the large number of images that are required to cover large areas and consequently iii) the longer elaboration time that is required to process the data. The fisheye approach, however, proved to be more effective thanks to the more robust image network resulting both from the wider field of view and from the possibility to handle large datasets by downsampling the images and still retrieving strong key points. The main difference with the first system is that the monotonous images acquired by the 20mm lens, very plain in texture, require working at full resolution in order to distinguish valid features in the sand. The final product of the tests carried out along this line in 2019 at Saqqara (Egypt) is a comprehensive DSM of the entire archaeological site with an accuracy of ~3cm. © Authors 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

With advancement in marine technology, it has become critical to detect and track the target by obtaining active measurements before it is close enough to attack. The utilization of unmanned underwater vehicles for target tracking behavior is gaining great attention due to continuous advancement of underwater vehicular technology. Nevertheless, safe and stable communications issues among different acoustic devices are still under active investigation to reach a robust, secure, and flexible underwater networking. Moreover, due to harsh underwater environment, acoustic simulations are also time-consuming; therefore, an accurate model for target detection and tracking is a necessity.

In this work, a novel system is described that is capable of deploying SUAS from larger aircraft so that they can be transported to the mission space over long range. This deployment is performed in stages to safely transition the SUAS from high speed/high altitude launch to a mission area near sea level. The first piece of the system is a pod (modeled after a common munition), with folding wings and fins for gliding capability, that is capable of carrying multiple SUAS. Stored within the pod is one or more capsules designed to protect and slow the internally mounted SUAS to the effective operating speed. At the correct operating speed and altitude, the SUAS can be released and handed off to aircraft operators or flown autonomously into high-threat environments. This work describes the development, analysis and testing of this system. Alpha-level prototypes were developed and tested along with detailed analysis. The initial results indicate that the proposed concept is feasible and will greatly enhance the capabilities of SUAS. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, the cellular networks have been traditionally designed to serve terrestrial users, and thus are encountering many challenges to support drone wireless communication. Particularly, drones experience increased interference and channel fluctuation and consequently suffer more frequent handover, higher handover failure rate and ping-pong rate while in motion. In this paper, we propose enhanced mobility management for drones by exploiting their pre-configured flight path information. Our route-aware handover algorithm will instruct the base station to trigger the handover procedure to minimize handover failure and reduce unnecessary handover. We further provide a practical implementation where the network can make online decisions under realistic modeling assumptions. Based on 3GPP-compliant handover evaluation methodology, we demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively reduce the number of handover and handover failure by upto 32Ã- and 24Ã-, respectively, compared to the existing approach. This significantly reduces handover signalling overhead and service interruption time. The simulation results also show that our algorithm can completely eliminate ping-pong effect in certain cases. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Moreover, mechanization has not been integral to farming, and thus managing a farm is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Consequently, precision agriculture (PA) offers great opportunities for improvement. Using geographic information and communication technology (Geo-ICTs) principles, PA offers the opportunity for a farmer to apply the right amount of treatment at the right time and at the right location in the farm. However, in order to collect timely high-resolution data, drone-based sensing and image interpretation is required. These high-resolution images can give detailed information about the soil and crop condition, which can be used for farm management purposes. Leaf area index, normalized difference vegetation index, photochemical reflectance index, crop water stress index, and other such vegetation indices can provide important information on crop health. Temporal changes in these indices can give vital information about changes in health and canopy structure of the crop over time, which can be related to its biophysical and biochemical stress. These stresses may have occurred due to insufficient soil nutrient, inappropriate soil moisture, or pest attack. Through UAV-based PA, stressed areas can be identified in real time, and some corrective measures can also be carried out (e.g., fertilizer and pesticide spraying).

The method is based on a dialectical argumentation approach along with a commitment-based theory of mind.

The electrocardiogram (ECG), which records the electrical activity presented in the heart, is used for the prevention and treatment of heart disease such as MI. However, it remains a challenge to visually interpret the ECG signals because of their small amplitude and duration. Inspired by the development in computer vision, we try to explore a novel approach for automatic detection of MI by imaging ECG signals without noise removal. In this paper, the ECG time series is first transformed into images using the Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF) method. Subsequently, the processed images are subjected to the principal component analysis network (PCANet) to extract sparse high-dimensional features, which are easy to perform well in linear classifiers. We carried out several sets of experiments to test the effectiveness of our algorithm. The overall accuracy of 99.49%, the sensitivity of 99.78%, and the specificity of 98.08% are achieved in class-oriented experiments using original ECG beats. The accuracy even rises over 1% compared with the denoising one; Moreover, we also achieved favorable performance for the patient-specific experiment (accuracy of 93.17%, sensitivity of 93.91%, and specificity of 89.20%).

Prior work on unsteady, translating wings showed that for rectangular planforms the tip vortex (TV) aids in the outboard leading-edge vortex (LEV) attachment, but the two are distinct. However, aft sweep promotes a connection between the outboard LEV and TV and potentially delays inboard LEV shedding. Moreover, rotating wings with low Rossby number exhibit LEV attachment, greater TV coherence, and higher lift. This paper examines whether a variable wingtip (panel) combining sweep and outward rotation, superimposed on the main-wing translation, can modify the adjacent, outboard LEV via an interaction with its swept-edge vortex (SEV), and affect the prior TV and trailing-edge vortex (TEV). The goal is a temporary lift boost, e.g. for a maneuvering unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The panel’s ability to disrupt the outboard vortex formation during a streamwise gust-like motion (surge), via inward actuation to mitigate the lift increase, is also studied. Water towing-tank experiments are done with a wing of submerged aspect ratio 3.4, minus the panel, translating at 45◦ angle of attack and Reynolds number 10,000. Dye visualization via multiple injection ports, imaged using three orthogonal cameras, captures the 3D flow structure qualitatively. A starting flow and 50% streamwise gust after 21 chords are tested, with varying panel actuation timing, compared to a rectangular wing and static tip-sweep. In all cases, the main-wing speed divided by the forward tip speed, i.e. the advance ratio, is 0.95. For starting flows, outward tip-panel actuation at 0.1 chords traveled produces a new SEV, causes the TV and TEV to stretch outward and forward to follow the panel motion, and shifts the nearby-attached LEV outward; this should be beneficial for lift generation. For static tip sweep, the SEV appears to be less closely-attached. In both cases, the main LEV adjacent to the swept edge entrains SEV vorticity and temporarily weakens the SEV. Later tip actuation is less effective at modifying the flow structures, since this LEV interaction is exacerbated due to the larger LEV present when actuation starts. For the gust cases, inward panel actuation sheds the SEV and local TEV, and enhances LEV shedding similar to the rectangular wing. Also, it causes the aft TV flow to move inboard which is detrimental for lift. Actuation earlier, before the gust, has the greatest effect as it allows these phenomena to develop. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Fault-tolerant trajectory tracking, which exploits functional redundancies among the vehicle actuators, bears the potential to avoid fail-operational requirements on actuator level. Yet, the use of fault-tolerant trajectory tracking must be well argued as the number of possible driving scenarios of automated vehicles is virtually unlimited. We present a reference trajectory generation approach in order to support such a safety argumentation. The generation essentially respects functional limits of the specific vehicle automation application, e.g., maximum speed or lateral acceleration. Derived from standard maneuvers of automated vehicles, the trajectories are generated with varying paths and speed profiles for the specific application. Eventually, a set of trajectories is generated for an example application and applied to investigate the potential of a selected fault-tolerant trajectory tracking approach. The simulation results for the example application reveal the shortcomings of the selected fault-tolerant trajectory tracking algorithm. However, these results also indicate that fault-tolerant trajectory tracking can be employed within the example application once the shortcomings of the algorithm are resolved. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Both DIY and COTS UAVs are difficult to detect in a realistic environment, particularly in a cluttered and noisy one such as a port facility. In this context the use of active detection systems such as radar, and lidar is limited since it should not adversely interfere with the normal operation of the port, in particular the existing harbour sensors. This leads our interest towards passive multi-sensor detection systems such as electro-optic (EO) and acoustic monitoring. This work investigates the capability of passive acoustic systems to detect small commercial UAVs within the context of a harbour.

We collected audio signatures of several different types of commercial off-the-shelf UAVs both in a quiet environment and in a variety of complex real environment. For this we used a directional 4-microphone array composed of readily available audio components. This setup limited our experiment to the audible spectrum, in which motor and propeller noise are the main characteristics used to distinguish the UAV from the background sounds.

However, the UAV communication environments are not only harsh, but are also confronted with the threats of smart attackers, which pose great barriers in maintaining the links unblocked. In this paper, we leverage the paradigm of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to formulate an attack-resilient connectivity game between a pair of neighboring UAVs and an attacker. In the three-agent adversary game, the attacker acts as the generator, which attempts to generate highly approximate information as the UAVs so as to maximize its jamming capability; while the pairwise UAVs act as the discriminators, which attempt to enhance the capability of refusing the fake information (i.e., the opponent's attack). As the state-of-the-art GAN learning algorithms suffer from the instability dilemma (i.e., either with the unsuccessful convergence or with the low generation/discrimination performance), we incorporate the conditional GAN with the least square objective loss function as well as the mean square error such that the attacker can improve the detection capability from UAVs' historical activity patterns and the UAVs can accordingly adjust the connectivity strategy. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through extensive evaluations. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the convergence efficiency, reduce the connection latency, and enhance the attack-resilience capability significantly. © 2019 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems.

The input module of the network integrates the domain knowledge of widely used retinal preprocessing and vessel enhancement techniques. We specially customize the output block of the network with a spatial activation mechanism, which takes advantage of a relatively easier task of vessel segmentation and exploits it to boost the performance of A/V classification. In addition, deep supervision is introduced to the network to assist the low level layers to extract more semantic information. The proposed network achieves pixel-wise accuracy of 95.70% for vessel segmentation, and A/V classification accuracy of 94.50%, which is the state-of-the-art performance for both tasks on the AV-DRIVE dataset. Furthermore, we have also tested the model performance on INSPIRE-AVR dataset, which achieves a skeletal A/V classification accuracy of 91.6%. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In order to mitigate the threats and to prevent cyber-crime, digital forensics on drone data is both critical as well as lacking in terms of efficacy studies. In this paper, we define a digital forensic methodology for analyzing drone data, and we propose a self organizing map (SOM)-based method for aiding such analysis.

A semi-autonomous adaptive cruise control (SA-ACC) vehicle is considered which has wireless communication with its immediately preceding vehicle to operate at small time-gap distances without creating string instability. However, the reliability of the wireless connectivity is critical for ensuring safe vehicle operation. The presence of two unknown inputs related to both sensor failure and cyber-attack seemingly poses a difficult estimation challenge. The dynamic system is first represented in descriptor system form. An observer with estimation error dynamics decoupled from the cyber-attack signal is developed. The performance of the observer is extensively evaluated in simulations. The estimation system is able to detect either a fault in the velocity measurement radar channel or a cyber-attack. Also, the proposed observer-based controller achieves resilient SA-ACC system under the cyber-attacks. The fundamental estimation algorithm developed herein can be extended in the future to enable cyber-attack detection in more complex connected vehicle architectures.

By leveraging the weather and traffic predictions enabled by the emerging CAV technologies, the proposed strategy is able to minimize the A/C system energy consumption while maintaining the occupant thermal comfort (OTC) within the comfort constraints, where the comfort is quantified by a modified predictive mean vote (PMV) model adapted for an automotive application. A general CECO problem is formulated and addressed using model predictive control (MPC) and weather/traffic previews. Depending on the ways of exploiting the preview information and enforcing the OTC constraint, different MPCs are developed based on solving different variations of the general CECO problem. The CECO-based MPCs are then tested in simulation using an automotive A/C system simulation model (CoolSim) as the virtual testbed. The simulation results show that, over SC03 driving cycle, the proposed CECO-based MPCs outperform the baseline cabin temperature tracking controller, reducing the A/C system energy consumption by up to 7.6%, while achieving better OTC according to the PMV-based metrics. This energy saving in A/C system translates to 3.1% vehicle fuel economy improvement. The trade-off between energy efficiency and OTC for different control scenarios is also highlighted.

In this work, we seek to minimize this cost by computing a “Stackelberg punishment,” in which the player selects a behavior that sufficiently punishes the other player while maximizing its own score under the assumption that the other player will adopt a best response. This idea generalizes the concept of a Stackelberg equilibrium. Known efficient algorithms for computing a Stackelberg equilibrium can be adapted to efficiently produce a Stackelberg punishment. We demonstrate an application of this idea in an experiment involving a virtual autonomous vehicle and human participants.

Position accuracy, high availability, robustness of operation and formal integrity of the observables are the priorities, which are giving rise and shaping a new class of automotive receiver components and architectures. Moreover, because the autonomous driving and ADAS are safety critical, on top of previous requirements there is also the requirement for Functional Safety (informally called FuSa) compliancy. The documents codifying Functional Safety for automotive are the ISO26262 part 1 to part 11. The ISO26262 complements the well-known reliability automotive standard AEC-Q100. With respect to FuSa, a system can be defined as functionally safe if it always operates correctly and predictably. More importantly, in the event of failures, the system must remain safe for persons. Lastly also security is becoming a paramount and a new standard for cybersecurity in automotive, the ISO/SAE 21434, is in development where for a GNSS receiver this means robustness versus jamming, spoofing and meaconing attacks.

These systems require awareness of the environment and their own performance to reach a mission goal. This awareness enables them to adapt their operations to handle unexpected changes in the environment and uncertainty in assessments. Components of the autonomous system cannot rely on perfect awareness or actuator execution, and mistakes of one component can affect the entire system. To obtain a robust system, a system-wide approach is needed and a realistic model of all aspects of the system and its environment. In this paper, we present our study on the design and development of a fully functional autonomous system, consisting of sensors, observation processing and behavior analysis, information database, knowledge base, communication, planning processes, and actuators. The system behaves as a teammate of a human operator and can perform tasks independently with minimal interaction. The system keeps the human informed about relevant developments that may require human assistance, and the human can always redirect the system with high-level instructions. The communication behavior is implemented as a Social AI Layer (SAIL). The autonomous system was tested in a simulation environment to support rapid prototyping and evaluation. The simulation is based on the Robotic Operating System (ROS) with fully modelled sensors and actuators and the 3D graphics-enabled physics simulation software Gazebo. In this simulation, various flying and driving autonomous systems can execute their tasks in a realistic 3D environment with scripted or user-controlled threats.

By exploiting this as well as the ability of CA to utilise local interactions of individual CA cells to function as a receptable for information processing, we propose a CA-based security protocol (CASP) to safeguard the integrity of QR codes. First, undertaking an extensive and conscientious study of the composition of QR codes, we propose delineating an encrypt-able area (EA) that excludes key areas needed to retain physical appearance and properties of an innocuous QR Code. Further, we adduce a zoning structure that demarcates the EA into seven zones. Our analysis shows that careful adulteration of contents of at least two zones are enough to produce encrypted versions of the QR codes. Second, each zone is partitioned into m tiles, each a 3×3 sub-block and then local interactions emanating from the occupancy (or strength) of the tiles are used to determine the composition of first- and second-tier rulesets. Third, to steer the evolution of the QR Codes, we propose the use of zone and cell-wise dextral boundary conditions (DBC) that combine a troika of cells permeating contents of a tile at state t to determine the left-most cell entry at state t+1 of its evolution. Further, we impose a pixel-wise constraint that ensures that each encrypted tile has a discordance that is no less than the in-built error correction tolerance of the code. This property guarantees adequate scrambling of the QR code to mitigate unauthorised access to it and the information it conceals. Meanwhile, considering the properties (balanced, linear and reversible) and nature of our rulesets, the proposed CASP protocol recovers QR codes that are seamlessly scannable as conduits leading authorized users to confidential information. We validated our protocol by implementing both the encryption and recovery procedures on different versions of QR Codes and our results suggest that, on average, modifications up to a minimum of 2 to 5% of any two zones of the delineated EA were enough to securely encrypt Versions 2, 3, and 4 QR Codes that were reported in the experiments; thus, rendering them unscannable and the information they conceal inaccessible. Similarly, the recovery process yields an average 97% fidelity between the original and recovered QR Codes, which is enough to restore full functionality of the codes without need for any special hardware or add-ons. Moreover, rulesets employed in our protocol are profuse, dynamic and complex, which are key properties for CA-based cryptography. This demonstrates the efficacy of our protocol as a tool to confine the transitory role of QR Codes to authorised users. © 2012 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This paper presents the performance results obtained when testing in real conditions an innovative positioning engine based on a safety-oriented paradigm. The tested engine employs a mass market dual-frequency GNSS receiver, intelligent off-the shelf automotive cameras, accurate navigation maps, low-cost inertial sensors and vehicle odometry. A unique feature is the provided integrity layer, estimated in real-time and consisting of Protection Levels (PL), which bound the error of each estimated value with a certain confidence level. This integrity layer is used as part of autonomous vehicle architecture to ensure that the vehicle navigates safely. The results show the position performances along with the real confidence levels achieved by the estimated Protection Levels. The solution estimated by the engine in real time is based on the dual-frequency measurements obtained from a mass-market GNSS receiver, the measurements of the lateral distance to the lane-markings provided by an intelligent off-the shelf automotive camera, lane-level accurate navigation maps, the measurements obtained from low-cost inertial sensors and the vehicle odometry. With respect to the engine, it is able to process all these measurements by means of: - A real time PPP hybrid algorithm that employs dual-frequency GPS and Galileo measurements, inertial sensors and PPP corrections obtained from a web server when the connection is available through the cellular network. - A robust hybrid GNSS standard positioning algorithm allowing to perform consistency checks in parallel - An algorithm that improves the accuracy by means of the vehicle sensors, the lateral distance measurements to the road lane markings provided by the automotive intelligent camera and the lane-level accurate maps. It is also able to provide an accurate position relative to the map. The position and orientation values provided by the engine (including the position computed relative to the map) are complemented with the estimation of the associated integrity Protection Levels (PL), computed for multiple target integrity risks. The implementation of an integrity layer is crucial since in safety-critical applications it can be more important to know whether the information is reliable than the precise information itself. This integrity layer determines the degree of usability of the location and orientation estimations, which is used as part of autonomous vehicle architecture to ensure that the vehicle operates safely. The position and integrity engine has been integrated in an autonomous car and has been tested in real conditions under different environments assessing its performances based on the accurate reference provided by other equipment installed in the car for testing purposes. The paper presents the position and protection level performance results obtained when testing the vehicle under open-sky, sub-urban and deep urban conditions. The engine employed to obtain the results presented in this paper has been developed and tested with an autonomous car within the ESCAPE project ([1]). ESCAPE (European Safety Critical Applications Positioning Engine) is a project co-funded under the Fundamental Elements program of the European GNSS Agency (GSA). It started on October 2016 with a duration of 3 years and with the main objective of developing a localisation system that provides the vehicle position and attitude estimations to be employed in safety critical applications like Autonomous Driving (AD) or Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). The project is led by the Spanish company FICOSA in collaboration with partners from across Europe: Renault, IFSSTAR and the University of Technology of Compiègne (UTC) from France, STMicroelectronics and LINKS Foundation from Italy and GMV from Spain. ESCAPE enables a high-grade of data fusion (GNSS, inertial sensors, cameras and vehicle sensors) and the exploitation of several key technological differentiators such as the precise point positioning service (PPP), the potential use of the Galileo signal authentication and the provision of an integrity layer to assess the degree of trust one can associate to the position information provided by the device. Therefore, the three key pillars of the safety-oriented navigation technology provided by ESCAPE engine are: ■ The smart exploitation of different localization data sources to provide a highly accurate navigation solution, including GPS and Galileo dual-frequency measurements, intelligent cameras providing lateral distance to road lane-marks, inertial measurement units, vehicle odometry, PPP corrections and high definition maps; ■ The unique provision of real-time integrity protection levels associated to the location estimates, which express the “degree of usability” of the positioning information for safety-critical applications. The PLs associated to the positions computed relative to the map are fundamental for autonomous driving applications; The full integration of the ESCAPE engine into a vehicle with autonomous driving capabilities, and its test on several different reference paths and environmental conditions. The innovative ESCAPE GNSS Engine (EGE) is close-to-market, its components are organized in a modular architecture and has safety at its core as its specification and design are based on the ISO 26262 recommendations ([2]). ESCAPE was already introduced in [3].

There are two methods through which neonatal hearing screening is carried out – the transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) or the automatic BERA (AABR, automated auditory brainstem response). Positive screening means the discovery of a hearing defect (permanent hearing loss), and negative screening (normal TEOAE or the AABR results) means the absence of a hearing defect. The procedural aim is to update and adjust the neonatal hearing screening, which is determined by the Bulletin of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic No. 7/2012. Neonatal screening is performed at three levels: at neonatological site, at the ENT (phoniatric) rescreening site and at the ENT regional centre. The activities at each level are accurately and concretely identified including the issue of billing the performance to health insurance companies and informed consent to personal data protection (GDPR). The correct functioning of screening for hearing loss is based on the simple organization of the screening, patient examination comfort, medical recovery from it, and its economic viability. The schedule for neonatal hearing screening and rehabilitation recommends the following steps: 1. screening of a newborn’s hearing on the second or third day after delivery by a neonatological nurse using otoacoustic emissions, alternatively AABR for newborns at risk; 2. hearing rescreening in the third to sixth week of child’s age at the ENT rescreening site; 3. completion of hearing impairment diagnostics within three to sixth months of age at the ENT regional centre. The failure to follow the procedure above is a threat to the hearing and speech development of the child with severe permanent hearing impairment. The collaboration of ENT doctors with neonatologists and paediatricians allows for creating conditions under which the functional nationwide hearing screening of newborns can be established throughout the Czech Republic. © 2019, Czech Medical Association J.E.

A modest number of data breaches have been studied, including credit card information in natural language data and identities from face dataset. However, most of these studies focus on supervised learning models. As deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been deployed in a number of real-world systems, such as indoor robot navigation, whether trained DRL policies can leak private information requires in-depth study. To explore such privacy breaches in general, we mainly propose two methods: environment dynamics search via genetic algorithm and candidate inference based on shadow policies. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate such privacy vulnerabilities in DRL under various settings. We leverage the proposed algorithms to infer floor plans from some trained Grid World navigation DRL agents with LiDAR perception. The proposed algorithm can correctly infer most of the floor plans and reaches an average recovery rate of 95.83% using policy gradient trained agents. In addition, we are able to recover the robot configuration in continuous control environments and an autonomous driving simulator with high accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate privacy leakage in DRL settings and we show that DRL-based agents do potentially leak privacy-sensitive information from the trained policies. © 2019 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

Due to the morphological diversification of the heart and the factors of MRI itself, fully automated and concurrent bi-ventricle segmentation is a well-known challenge. In this paper, we propose cascaded conditional generative adversarial networks (C-cGANs) to divide the problem into two segmentation subtasks: binary segmentation for region of interest (ROI) extraction and bi-ventricle segmentation. In both subtasks, we adopt adversarial training that makes discriminator network to discriminate segmentation maps either from generator network or ground-truth which aims to detect and correct pixel-wise inconsistency between the sources of segmentation maps. For capturing more spatial information with multi-scale semantic features, in the generator network, we insert a multi-scale attention fusion (MSAF) module between the encoder and decoder paths.

Rule-based mechanisms have been considered as a solution in the past. However, rule-based solutions operate on the goodwill of the generated rules and perform assumption-based detection. Such a solution often is far from the actual realization of IoT runtime performance and can be fooled by zero-day attacks. Thus, this paper takes this issue as a motivation and proposes better lightweight behavior rule specification-based misbehavior detection for IoT-embedded cyber-physical systems (BRIoT). The key concept of our approach is to model a system with which misbehavior of an IoT device manifested as a result of attacks exploiting the vulnerability exposed may be detected through automatic model checking and formal verification, regardless of whether the attack is known or unknown. Automatic model checking and formal verification are achieved through a 2-layer Fuzzy-based Hierarchical Context-Aware Aspect-Oriented Petri Net (HCAPN) model, while effective misbehavior detection to avoid false alarms is achieved through a Barycentric-coordinated based center of mass calculation method. The proposed approach is verified by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) embedded in a UAV system. The feasibility of the proposed model is demonstrated with high reliability, low operational cost, low false-positives, low false-negatives, and high true positives in comparison with existing rule-based solutions. © 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

"Fast surveys and molecular diet analysis of carnivores based on fecal DNA and metabarcoding","2019","Biodiversity Science","10.17520/biods.2018214","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076750174&doi=10.17520%2fbiods.2018214&partnerID=40&md5=35e13baf43b4afdf88bdd7eb6eb09444","Large carnivores play an important role in the regulation of food-web structure and ecosystem functioning. However, large carnivores face serious threats that have caused declines in their populations and geographic ranges due to habitat loss and degradation, hunting, human disturbance and pathogen transmission. Conservation of large carnivore species richness and population size has become a pressing issue and an important research focus of conservation biology. The western Sichuan Plateau, located at the intersection of the mountains of southwest China and the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, is a global biodiversity hotspot and has high carnivore species richness. However, increasing human activities may exacerbate the destruction of local flora and fauna, thereby threatening the survival of wild carnivores. Information on species composition and dietary habits can improve our understanding of the structure and function of the ecosystem and food-web relationships in the study area. In addition, species composition and dietary habits are of great significance for understanding multi-species coexistence mechanisms and preserving biodiversity. This study collected carnivore fecal samples from Xinlong and Shiqu counties in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province. DNA was then extracted from the samples and the species was identified based on DNA sequences and DNA barcoding techniques. Seven carnivores were identified, including five large carnivores (Canis lupus, Ursus arctos, Panthera pardus, P. uncia and Canis lupus familiaris) and two medium and small-sized carnivores (Prionailurus bengalensis and Vulpes vulpes). Using fecal DNA, high-throughput sequencing and metabarcoding, we conducted diet analysis for the seven carnivores and found 28 different food molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs), including 19 mammals, eight birds and one fish species. The predominant prey categories of wolves, dogs and brown bears were ungulates. The domestic yak (Bos grunniens) was the most frequently identified prey species. Small mammals such as rodents and lagomorphs accounted for a significant proportion in the diets of leopard cats and red foxes, The most frequent prey of this category of carnivore were the Chinese scrub vole (Neodon irene) and plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae). In addition, leopards and snow leopards mainly fed on the Chinese goral (Naemorhedus griseus) and blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur), respectively. Our study highlights the utility of fecal DNA and metabarcoding technique in fast carnivore surveys and high-throughput diet analysis, and provides a technical reference and guidance for future biodiversity surveys and food-web studies. © 2019, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Usually, the medical diagnosis of intestinal parasites is carried out in the laboratory by visual analysis of stools samples using the optical microscope. The parasite recognition is realized by comparing its shape with known forms. We offer a solution to automate the diagnosis of intestinal parasites through their images obtained from a microscope connected directly to a computer. Our approach exploits the contour detection based on the multi-scale wavelet transform for detecting the parasite. Active contours are combined with the Hough transform to perform image segmentation and extraction of the parasite. We used principal component analysis for the extraction and reduction of features obtained directly from pixels of the extracted parasite image. Our classification tool is based on the probabilistic neural network. The obtained algorithms were tested on 900 samples of microscopic images of 15 different species of intestinal parasites.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can be used as air base stations to support user equipment (UE). UAV base station (UAV-BS) development plays a major part in rescue operations and post-disaster reconstruction. Improving network throughput in the UAV-BS signal coverage area and reducing deployment costs while maintaining effective communication are important issues that need to be addressed. In view of the problem, this paper demonstrates the problem of maximizing network throughput under the constraint of UAV-BS capacity by deploying UAV-BS. We proposed a UAV-artificial bee colony (U-ABC) algorithm to solve the problem of UAV-BS deployment. U-ABC algorithm can calculate the optimal flight position of each UAV-BS and maximum network throughput in the disaster area. In performance evaluation, we compared U-ABC algorithm with genetic algorithm, Greedy-ABC algorithm, PSO algorithm, DI-PSO algorithm and PSO-GWO algorithm. We analyzed the flight height altitude of UAV-BSs, the interference factor of UAV-BS, and the influence of the number of UE on network throughput. Results show that the proposed method improved the overall network throughput and achieved a high UE coverage rate under a given number of UAV-BSs. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

PTX is usually detected using chest X-ray but can be detected using lung ultrasound, which requires interpretation by an expert radiologist. We are developing an AI based algorithm for the automated interpretation of lung ultrasound video to enable fast diagnosis of pneumothorax at the point of care by health care providers without extensive training in ultrasound. In this work, we developed and compared several deep learning methods for identifying pneumothoraces in 3-s ultrasound videos collected with a handheld ultrasound system. The first group of methods were based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) paired with time-mapping preprocessing algorithms, including reconstructed M-mode and the proposed simplified optical flow transform (SOFT). These preprocessing methods were either used alone or in combination in a single “fusion” CNN. The second class of algorithm used a Deep Learning architecture that combines a CNN for processing spatial information (Inception V3) with a recurrent network (long-short-term-memory, or LSTM) for temporal analysis, enabling raw video to be fed directly into the neural network without preprocessing. We used data from a swine pneumothorax model to train and test the proposed algorithms, comparing their performance.

In the process of developing the mangrove ecosystems, detailed data are required to provide a comprehensive overview of the environmental and physical conditions of the mangrove ecosystems. The study aims at identifying and making the inventory of the existing condition of the mangrove ecosystems related to mangrove cover and biodiversity. The data are collected using aerial photography and UAVs, observation and field measurement. The data inventory making is the first step in the process of developing and preserving the mangrove ecosystems.

Unlike the past, when the three-dimensional data acquisition tools were very expensive, they required to carefully planning the survey and they were used mainly by experienced users, today these sensors are widely available on the mass market at low prices allowing to get suitable results for different types of applications. Smartphones can now be easily mounted on UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle) systems in such a way that, potentially, anyone can access the data acquisition and extraction of 3D information, and, the advantage of using these techniques lies in the fact that it is possible to exploit the radiometric information contained in 2D image pixels using different strategies, like stereo matching and the structure from motion approach. Since, in recent years, smartphones devices have had a great improvement and the embedded sensors are becoming more efficient in terms of accuracy and reliability, this chapter attempts to analyse the complexity of the use of these kind of sensors for 3D reconstruction, which require a lot of a priori knowledge of the internal sensors (e.g., camera calibration, data extraction, etc.) to reach stable results.

The MIP's nonlinear mathematical model which includes the dynamics of the actuators is presented. Then, the model around an operating point is considered which allows to exploit the differential flatness property of the system, permitting a complete parametrization in terms of the flat output. Assuming that the vehicle network exchange information through a directed and strongly connected graph, a decentralized control law is designed, and an event-based algorithm is developed. Then each MIP decides, based on the difference of its current state and its latest broadcast state, when it has to send a new value to its neighbors. The stability of the complete system is carried out in the Lyapunov sense together with the ISS (Input-to-State Stability) approach. Numerical results show the advantages wrt information exchange between MIPs, as well as a good performance in the angular stabilization under two scenarios: regulation and tracking problem. © 2019 Universitat Politecnica de Valencia.

In this work, the navigation performance of the Android smartphone's IMU was assessed thoroughly. The raw IMU data from two smartphones, 'Xiaomi 8' and 'Honor Play' were recorded, using different sampling rates, and compared with the measurements, recorded simultaneously from higher grade IMU's. For assessing the navigation capabilities of the smartphones IMU sensors, two kinematic tests were designed. In these tests, the smartphones IMU data were processed using a 15-state Kalman Filter developed by our group, while the reference IMU data were processed using a commercial software. The details of the comparisons between the positioning, velocity and attitude solutions are discussed. The results show that the navigation solutions of both smartphones are quite close to that of the reference IMUs', showing differences of around 0.2 m in positioning, 0.3 m/s in velocity, and 1° in roll and pitch. The quality of the yaw estimation, with an accuracy of a few degrees, is clearly worse than that of the other attitude parameters. However, the results of the second test reveal that using a higher data rate setting for the IMU samplings, it is possible to improve the solution.

The combination of fosfomycin with other antibiotics has been reported but with inconsistent results. Thus, we performed synergy testing of fosfomycin combined with tigecycline by E-test, which was easy to perform and to determine results, compared with microdilution checkerboard, which is considered to be the “gold standard”, to evaluate the agreement between the two methods. Methods: Thirty non-repetitive KPC-Kp isolates from different patients were included in this study. Bacterial identification and routine antibiotic susceptibility testing were performed by a VITEK 2 Compact automated system. The KPC producing isolates were identified by modified Carbapenem Inhibitory Method (mCIM) and PCR amplification of carbapenemase genes. Synergy testing of fosfomycin combined with tigecycline was performed by E-test (E-test stripes were placed at 90° angle), with microdilution chequerboard performed in parallel. Fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS 18.0 software. Results: All 30 KPC-Kp were mCIM test positive and KPC-2 producing. The susceptibility rates of fosfomycin and tigecycline were 36.7% (11/30) and 63.3% (19/30), respectively. Both checkerboard and E-test results showed that most MICs of fosfomycin and tigecycline decreased in the combination group. FICI showed 13.3% - 16.7% isolates were synergistic, 30.0% - 36.7% were additive, and 50.0% - 53.3% were indifferent. No antagonism was found. There was no significant difference between the two groups (p > 0.05), and the overall agreement (with FICI difference ≤ 0.25 in each isolate) between the two methods was 76.7% (23/30).

Such threats range from the emotional misbehaviour of sports fans in sports venues to well-planned terrorist attacks. Moreover, tools are needed to assist in the search for wanted persons. Static solutions, such as closed circuit television (CCTV), exist, but there is a need for a highly-portable, on-demand solution. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have evolved drastically over the past decade. Developments are observed not only with regards to flight mechanisms and extended flight times but also in the imaging and image stabilization capabilities. Although different methods for facial recognition have existed for some time, dealing with imaging from a moving source to detect the faces in the crowd and compare them to an existing face database is a scientific problem that requires a complex solution. This paper deals with real-time face recognition in the crowd using unmanned aerial vehicles.

However, accurately detecting 3D objects was until recently a quality unique to expensive LiDAR ranging devices. Approaches based on cheaper monocular imagery are typically incapable of identifying 3D objects. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predict accurate 3D bounding box locations on monocular images. We first train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to perform monocular depth estimation. The ground truth training depth data is obtained via depth completion on LiDAR scans. Next, we combine both depth and appearance data into a birds-eye-view representation with height, density and grayscale intensity as the three feature channels. Finally, We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on our feature map leveraging bounding boxes annotated on corresponding LiDAR scans.

A feature of modern UAVs is the ability to perform sudden maneuvers and to keep the same position in the point in space. For the description of the UAV movement with various types of maneuver it is used a rectangular coordinate system. We use the model in the form of stochastic dynamic system with random structure in the discrete time in which the change type UAV movement occurs at random times. When a UAV emits a sign, its location can be determined by wireless sensor networks (WSN) using the TDOA method. On the basis of a mathematical apparatus of the mixed Markov processes for in discrete time optimal and quasi-optimal adaptive algorithms for filtration of UAV movement parameters based on the TDOA-measurement, sensor networks are synthesized. Devices that realize these algorithms are multichannel and belong to the class of devices with feedback between channels. At the same time, in a quasi-optimal algorithm, a sequential procedure of the arriving measurements from sensors of a sensor network is realized, which allows to avoid the inversion of large-dimensional matrices. An analysis of the quasi-optimal adaptive algorithm is performed using statistical modeling. On the intervals of hovering and of the UAV movements without maneuver, the developed algorithm allows to increase significantly the accuracy of the estimation of the UAV coordinates, and also to recognize various types of its movement with high probability level. © 2019, Journal of Aerospace Technology and Management.

A small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) has been equipped with a flush air data system and experimentally tested. The flush air data system uses computational fluid dynamics to train neural networks and is validated using the in-flight data that were previously collected. Results of the flight validation are presented, along with ways to improve the accuracy of the system. Several different calibration approaches are presented and compared with each other. The best-case results with the in-flight calibration are 0.598 and 0.668 for angle of attack and sideslip, respectively, whereas the best-case results when calibrated with computational fluid dynamics data are 0.788 and 0.908. It is also possible to estimate other air data parameters, such as dynamic pressure, static pressure, and density, with neural networks, but the direct calculation is more accurate. Calibrating the system numerically, such as with the use of computational fluid dynamics, removes the need for any calibration flights.

Due to the uncooperative nature of the target, in these scenarios, relative navigation is carried out exploiting active or passive Electro-Optical sensors mounted on board the chaser. The focus here is placed on active systems, e.g., LIDARs. In this paper, an original loosely-coupled relative navigation architecture which integrates pose determination algorithms designed to process raw LIDAR data (i.e., 3D point clouds) within a Kalman filtering scheme is presented. Pose determination algorithms play a twofold role being used to initialize the filter state and covariance as well as in the update phase of the Kalman filter. The proposed filtering scheme is an Unscented Kalman Filter designed to use, as measurements for the update phase, relative position, attitude and angular velocity estimates. Performance assessment is carried out within a simulation environment realistically reproducing the operation of a scanning LIDAR and the relative motion between two spacecraft during a target monitoring maneuver.

However, it remains challenging to quickly but accurately locate an interference source from the distance, especially when little is known about the interference source. To handle this problem, a single learning algorithm can be exploited to search and locate the interference source. However, it is varying dynamics in varying environments that can make the design of such a learning algorithm intractable. In our study, we employ an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to realize the localization. Moreover, a novel multimodal Q-learning framework along with its algorithm is proposed, and the framework combines pattern recognition with Q-learning. The proposed learning architecture can adjust the parameters of Q-learning algorithm dynamically based on the changing environments so as to achieve better detection precision, longer localization distance and shorter searching time. The simulation verifies multimodal Q-learning algorithm's performance on interference source localization along with its capability of adapting to environmental change. The simulation results confirm the proposed concept of multimodal Q-learning. It is shown that the multimodal Q-learning based localization algorithms can outperform various baselines in terms of both accuracy and detection distance. The searching time consumed by the UAV is also largely reduced. This observation indicates that the capability of environmental adaption introduced by the proposed multimodal framework can benefit the Q-learning algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Civil GNSS signals are vulnerable to notably spoofing and replay attacks. To counter such attacks, cryptographic methods are developed: Navigation Message Authentication (NMA) is one such scheme, about to be deployed for Galileo E1 Open Service (OS); it allows receivers to verify the signal origin and protects navigation message integrity. However, NMA signals cannot fully thwart replay attacks, which do not require forging navigation messages. Classic replay attacks, e.g, meaconing, retransmit previously recorded signals without any modification, thus highly limiting the capacity of the adversary. Distance-decreasing (DD) attacks are a strong type of replay attack, allowing fine-grained individual pseudorange manipulation in real time. Moreover, DD attacks counterbalance processing and transmission delays induced by adversary, by virtue of shifting earlier in time the perceived (relayed) signal arrival; thus shortening the pseudorange measurements. In this paper, we first analyze how DD attacks can harm the Galileo E1 OSNMA service assuming the adversary has no prior information on the navigation message. Moreover,we propose a DD attack detection method based on a Goodness of Fit test on the prompt correlator outputs of the victim. The results show that the method can detect the DD attacks even when the receiver has locked to the DD signals. © 2019, Institute of Navigation.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This paper presents a novel lightweight, morphing concept based on the exploitation of the ""lever effect"" of a bistable composite plate that can be integrated in an UAV horizontal tail. Flight dynamics equations are solved in Simulink environment, thus being able to simulate and compare different flight conditions with conventional and bistable command surfaces. Subsequently, bistable plates are built by using composite materials, paying particular attention to dimensions, asymmetric stacking sequence and total thickness needed to achieve bistability. NACA0011 airfoil is chosen for proving this concept. Wind tunnel tests demonstrate that the discrete surface is capable of withstanding the aerodynamic pressure. A remotely piloted vehicle is employed to test the discrete horizontal tail command during the take-off. The results show that, choosing a proper configuration of constraints, stacking sequence and aspect ratio for the bistable laminate, it is possible to tailor the snap-through mechanism.

"Driver-friendly emergency collision avoidance system via flatness direct yaw moment control","2019","Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference","10.1115/DETC2019-98174","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076467331&doi=10.1115%2fDETC2019-98174&partnerID=40&md5=8cef9d818a444c4d28594596e9484366","Unlike an autonomous driving system, a shared control system keeps the driver in the loop to exploit human’s decision-making, path-planning, and control skills in vehicle motion control. In the meantime, a shared control system consistently provides support to the driver in hazardous situations. Typical shared control systems concentrate on altering vehicle steering actions through either active front steering or haptic steering torque. However, an active front steering system requires costly hardware and a haptic steering torque explicitly interferences with the driver hand-wheel steering. To overcome the drawbacks of the steering-based strategies, this paper introduces a driver support system based on direct yaw moment control for high-speed collision avoidance maneuvers. The new system maintains a hierarchical structure with a high-level lateral velocity planner and a low-level lateral velocity governor. In addition, the personally-preferred collision avoidance trajectories of each driver are taken into account to make the controller personalizable. Carsim-Simulink joint simulations demonstrate that this novel shared control system can successfully assist the driver in high-speed collision avoidance maneuvers. Moreover, both physical and mental loads of the driver are substantially reduced in contrast to using an active front steering system. Copyright © 2019 ASME.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
"Beach safety: Can drones provide a platform for sighting sharks?","2019","Wildlife Research","10.1071/WR18119","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076690649&doi=10.1071%2fWR18119&partnerID=40&md5=209f1f543bd92826d0209c468860798d","Context: A series of unprovoked shark attacks on New South Wales (Australia) beaches between 2013 and 2015 triggered an investigation of new and emerging technologies for protecting bathers. Traditionally, bather protection has included several methods for shark capture, detection and/or deterrence but has often relied on environmentally damaging techniques. Heightened environmental awareness, including the important role of sharks in the marine ecosystem, demands new techniques for protection from shark attack. Recent advances in drone-related technologies have enabled the possibility of real-time shark detection and alerting. Aim: To determine the reliability of drones to detect shark analogues in the water across a range of environmental conditions experienced on New South Wales beaches. Methods: A standard multirotor drone (DJI Inspire 1) was used to detect shark analogues as a proxy during flights at 0900, 1200 and 1500 hours over a 3-week period. The 27 flights encompassed a range of environmental conditions, including wind speed (2-30.0 km h-1), turbidity (0.4-6.4 m), cloud cover (0-100%), glare (0-100%), seas (0.4-1.4 m), swells (1.4-2.5 m) and sea state (Beaufort Scale 1-5 Bf). Key results: Detection rates of the shark analogues over the 27 flights were significantly higher for the independent observer conducting post-flight video analysis (50%) than for the drone pilot (38%) (Wald P = 0.04). Water depth and turbidity significantly impaired detection of analogues (Wald P = 0.04). Specifically, at a set depth of 2 m below the water surface, very few analogues were seen by the observer or pilot when water turbidity reduced visibility to less than 1.5 m. Similarly, when water visibility was greater than 1.5 m, the detection rate was negatively related to water depth. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that drones can fly under most environmental conditions and would be a cost-effective bather protection tool for a range of user groups. Implications: The most effective use of drones would occur during light winds and in shallow clear water. Although poor water visibility may restrict detection, sharks spend large amounts of time near the surface, therefore providing a practical tool for detection in most conditions. © CSIRO 2019 Open Access.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we investigate the IoT task offloading under an SAGIN scenario where multiple IoT devices generate computing tasks to be processed. We adopt an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to fly along a given trajectory to collect the tasks of IoT devices within the coverage area, and then makes the online offloading decision, i.e., processing locally, or offloading to the nearby base station or the far-away satellite. However, due to the constrained energy resources committed by UAV and the uncertainty of the system dynamics, designing an efficient computation task offloading algorithm is challenging. This dynamic scheduling problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), considering the stochastic channel conditions, UAV coverage, energy consumption, and task queue backlogs. By exploiting the stationary stochastic feature of the CMDP, the problem can be solved by the linear programming to find a stochastic policy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed computation offloading scheme can significantly reduce IoT task processing delay as compared to other benchmarks. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The conventional UAV monopulse tracking technique requires dedicated pulses which suffer from multipath effect in air-To-ground (A2G) link with low elevation angles, whereas the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for A2G high rate communication under frequency selective fading channel was not yet investigated for UAV target tracking at ground station. In this paper, we propose a single-channel monopulse tracking (SCMT) angle estimation method in OFDM tracking receiver exploiting square-and absolute-value nonlinear detection of amplitude-modulated difference signals. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the proposed estimation method in terms of estimation range and estimation root mean squared error (RMSE). Results show that, the proposed angle estimation method exhibits S-shaped curve characteristic under different angle errors, which is insensitive to channels and modulations. The proposed method obtains angle estimation RMSEs smaller than 0.18° for antenna element distance d=\,\,0.5 m with 10 MHz OFDM signals. For both square-and absolute-value methods, a maximum degradation of 0.02° for angle estimation RMSEs is observed under Rician channels compared with the estimation under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, whereas the absolute-value estimation outperforms the square-value estimation. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This framework consists of two processes carried out simultaneously in a frame-to-frame basis: (1) an obstacle detector and classifier using a lightweight convolutional neural network with a UAV monocular onboard camera for real-time mobile systems; (2) a collision avoidance algorithm with a proportional controller responsible for the autonomous flight in GPS-denied outdoor environments. However, because object detection and classification are computationally intensive tasks, the processing is carried out off-board on a ground control station that receives online imagery and data of the UAV during the autonomous flight. The novel aspects in this work are related to the capacity of the system to detect and avoid obstacles in real-time with computationally low range hardware without GPU. We exploit public datasets meant for other purposes and carefully selected images to build a new lightweight dataset to train the CNN. Further, the output imagery data is used by a proportional controller that communicates back to the vehicle to evaluate a possible obstacle avoidance trajectory and execute it if necessary. We carried out evaluations and flights in real scenarios with multiple obstacles such as vehicles, people, bicycles, and trees for autonomous flights in GPS-denied outdoor environments with promising results. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To deliver those levels of QoS suitable to these applications, it is vital to exploit the multiple communication opportunities made available by the progressive deployment of the 5G and Smart City paradigms, ranging from ad-hoc networks among smartphones and surviving IoT devices, to cellular networks but also drone-based and vehicle-based wireless access networks. Therefore, the user device should be able to opportunistically select the most convenient among them to satisfy the demands for QoS imposed by the applications and also minimize the power consumption. The driving idea of this paper is to leverage non-cooperative game theory to design such an opportunistic user association strategy in a post-disaster scenario using UAV ad-hoc networks.

Research has demonstrated, however, that when platoons are placed in an adversarial environment, they are vulnerable to a variety of attacks that could negatively impact traffic flow and produce collisions and/or injuries. In this work, we consider an attack that seeks to exploit human-in-the-loop control of compromised vehicles that are part of a platoon. Specifically, we demonstrate that should a human operator need to suddenly take control of a platooned vehicle, significant upstream effects, which threaten the safety of passengers in other vehicles, may be induced. To counter this so-called disbanding attack, we present an optimal centralized mitigation approach. Due to scalability, security, and privacy concerns, such an approach may not be practical in reality. Hence, we also propose a decentralized mitigation algorithm that reduces excessive speed changes and coordinates inter-platoon behaviors to minimize the attack impacts. Our algorithm is compared to the aforementioned optimal approach and is shown to produce nearly equivalent results while requiring fewer resources. Experimental results on a hardware testbed show that our countermeasure permits graceful speed reductions and can provide safety, i.e., no collisions. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In DoS attacks, the legitimate users are prohibited from accessing the services or network resource. The primary goal of the attack to make the desired destination vehicle unavailable or relegate the message all the way through the network affects the reachability. The proposed reCAPTCHA controller mechanism prevents the automated attacks similarly like botnet zombies. The reCAPTCHA controller is used to check and prohibit most of the automated DDoS attacks. For implementing this technique, the information theory based metric is used to analyze the deviation in users request in terms of entropy. Frequency and entropy are the metrics used to measure the vulnerability of the attack. The stochastic model based reCAPTCHA controller is used as a prevention mechanism for the large botnet based attackers. To inspect the efficiency of the proposed method, various network parameters are considered such as Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Average Latency (AL), Detection Rate (DR) and Energy Consumption (EC). In the proposed research work, the metric PDR is used to know successful delivery of data packets to the destination vehicle without any interrruption. These parameters are used to measure how effectively the data is delivered to the destination from source vehicle. © 2019 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Continual Resolving (CR) is a recent theoretically sound approach to online game playing that has been used to outperform human professionals in poker. However, parts of the algorithm were specific to poker, which enjoys many properties not shared by other imperfect information games. We present a domain-independent formulation of CR applicable to any twoplayer zero-sum extensive-form games (EFGs). It works with an abstract resolving algorithm, which can be instantiated by various EFG solvers. We further describe and implement its Monte Carlo variant (MCCR) which uses Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) as a resolver.

In contrast, most developed countries now embrace human papillomavirus (HPV) analyses as standalone screening; this transition threatens to further widen the resource gap. Methods: We describe the development of a DNA-focused digital microholography platform for point-of-care HPV screening, with automated readouts driven by customized deep-learning algorithms. In the presence of high-risk HPV 16 or 18 DNA, microbeads were designed to bind the DNA targets and form microbead dimers. The resulting holographic signature of the microbeads was recorded and analyzed. Results: The HPV DNA assay showed excellent sensitivity (down to a single cell) and specificity (100% concordance) in detecting HPV 16 and 18 DNA from cell lines. Our deep learning approach was 120-folder faster than the traditional reconstruction method and completed the analysis in < 2 min using a single CPU. In a blinded clinical study using patient cervical brushings, we successfully benchmarked our platform's performance to an FDA-approved HPV assay. Conclusions: Reliable and decentralized HPV testing will facilitate cataloguing the high-risk HPV landscape in underserved populations, revealing HPV coverage gaps in existing vaccination strategies and informing future iterations. © The author(s).

An ATM security measure called “Control Command Verification” has been proposed to cope with the issues. The measure utilizes peripheral devices to prevent logical attacks “unauthorized cash withdrawals” for smart card transactions. When this measure is applied to magnetic stripe card transactions, there are a variety of implementable systems because of less implementation constraints resulted from the existing security standards for magnetic stripe card transactions. Properly implementable systems should be selected from these systems in terms of three viewpoints: preventing a wide range of logical attacks in a transaction, harmonizing with existing ATM operations, and minimizing the number of peripheral devices to be modified. This paper proposes a systematic implementation design method of the measure to satisfy those three viewpoints.

Since it is an unsupervised method, it overcomes one of the most limiting features of supervised algorithms that require training data sets a-priori obtained as representative of multipath and no-multipath conditions. The study exploits both the real GNSS data affected by the multipath in the surrounding environment that were collected at South African Antarctic research base SANAE-IV and the simulated data where the ionospheric, tropospheric and multipath errors are modelled.

In the present paper, the overall engineering approach developed to carry out the research work is presented, described and justified. Different technical and scientific challenges are addressed through an integrated industrial engineering design approach, where all disciplines are tuned to achieve the Blue Growth Farm main targets. These are represented by: i) guaranteeing expected nominal fish production thanks to advanced automation and remote control capabilities; ii) minimizing the pollution introduced at marine ecosystem level when exploiting the marine natural resources, whilst increasing the social acceptance and users community agreement; iii) maximizing the electricity production in the Blue Growth Farm potential installation area ecosystem to provide energy supply to the on-board electrical equipment and to dispatch the extra produced electric energy to the land network. Preliminary engineering design results are promising to demonstrate effective increase of safety and efficiency by reducing on-board human effort and consequently risks at offshore, thus to make commercial-scale open ocean farming a reality.

With the exploitation of wind power, multiple wind turbines (WTs) are deployed at remote and harsh areas, in which the adverse working environment may lead to enormous WT operating and maintenance costs. Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for WT detection and sensory data processing in wind farms has been considered as a promising technology to reduce the costs and improve inspection efficiency. In this paper, a mobile edge computing (MEC) driven UAV routine inspection scheme is proposed, in which the UAV not only detects WTs in multiple sorties, but also provides computing and offloading services. To provide seamless communication service, UAV can offload the sensory data to the ground station or satellite optimally. In order to minimize the total completion time, we jointly optimize the UAV trajectory and computation operations, while guaranteeing the data processing accuracy. In the proposed scheme, in order to overcome the influence of wind on UAV trajectory planning, a low complexity WT routine inspection trajectory and UAV scheduling approach is designed firstly. Then, we present an iterative optimization solution to minimize the energy consumption of computation processing, via finding the optimal offloading trajectory and computation offloading parameters. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the efficiency of UAV routine inspection system performance. © 2019 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It also exploits opponent modeling techniques thanks to Gaussian process regression and Bayesian learning. Evaluation is done by confronting the existing agents that are able to negotiate in such context: Random Walker, Tit-for-tat and Nice Tit-for-Tat. None of those agents succeeds in beating our agent.

"Clinical Decision-Support Systems for Detection of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, Sepsis, and Septic Shock in Critically Ill Patients: A Systematic Review","2019","Methods of Information in Medicine","10.1055/s-0039-1695717","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077401763&doi=10.1055%2fs-0039-1695717&partnerID=40&md5=41ceb3e3e3cbc4aa62f03e4aa5c02616","Background The design of computerized systems able to support automated detection of threatening conditions in critically ill patients such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis has been fostered recently. The increase of research work in this area is due to both the growing digitalization in health care and the increased appreciation of the importance of early sepsis detection and intervention. To be able to understand the variety of systems and their characteristics as well as performances, a systematic literature review is required. Existing reviews on this topic follow a rather restrictive searching methodology or they are outdated. As much progress has been made during the last 5 years, an updated review is needed to be able to keep track of current developments in this area of research. Objectives To provide an overview about current approaches for the design of clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) in the context of SIRS, sepsis, and septic shock, and to categorize and compare existing approaches. Methods A systematic literature review was performed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Searches for eligible articles were conducted on five electronic bibliographic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore, Embase, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. Initial results were screened independently by two reviewers based on clearly defined eligibility criteria. A backward as well as an updated search enriched the initial results. Data were extracted from included articles and presented in a standardized way. Articles were classified into predefined categories according to characteristics extracted previously. The classification was performed according to the following categories: clinical setting including patient population and mono- or multicentric study, support type of the system such as prediction or detection, systems characteristics such as knowledge- or data-driven algorithms used, evaluation of methodology, and results including ground truth definition, sensitivity, and specificity. All results were assessed qualitatively by two reviewers. Results The search resulted in 2,373 articles out of which 55 results were identified as eligible. Over 80% of the articles describe monocentric studies. More than 50% include adult patients, and only four articles explicitly report the inclusion of pediatric patients. Patient recruitment often is very selective, which can be observed from highly varying inclusion and exclusion criteria. The task of disease detection is covered in 62% of the articles; prediction of upcoming conditions in 33%. Sepsis is covered in 67% of the articles, SIRS as sole entity in only 4%, whereas 27% focus on severe sepsis and/or septic shock. The most common combinations of categories algorithm used and support type are knowledge-based detection of sepsis and data-driven prediction of sepsis. In evaluations, manual chart review (38%) and diagnosis coding (29%) represent the most frequently used ground truth definitions; most studies present a sample size between 10,001 and 100,000 cases (31%) and performances highly differ with only five articles presenting sensitivities and specificities above 90%; four of them using knowledge-based rather than machine learning algorithms. The presentations of holistic CDSS approaches, including technical implementation details, system interfaces, and data and interoperability aspects enabling the use of CDSS in routine settings are missing in nearly all articles. Conclusions The review demonstrated the high variety of research in this context successfully. A clear trend is observable toward the use of data-driven algorithms, and a lack of research could be identified in covering the pediatric population as well as acknowledging SIRS as an independent and threatening condition. The quality as well as the significance of the presented evaluations for assessing the performances of the algorithms in clinical routine settings are often not meeting the current standard of scientific work. Our future interest will be concentrated on these realistic settings by implementing and evaluating SIRS detection approaches as well as considering factors to make the CDSS useable in clinical routine from both technical and medical perspectives. © 2014 Georg Thieme Verlag.

The first step to perform these activities in a reliable manner, is to obtain an accurate robot localization estimate. Localization approaches based on multi-robot systems or complex acoustic infrastructures have been favored in the literature, but alternatively visual modalities are pursued when these options are not feasible. In this work, we present a two-stage navigation scheme that initially generates a coarse probabilistic map of the workspace that is used to refine localization accuracy and filter noise in the second stage. Additionally, an adaptive decision-making approach is introduced that determines which perception cues to incorporate into the localization filter, i.e., tracked 2D features or plane representations, to ensure high accuracy and reduce computation times. Our approach is thoroughly investigated in simulation and validated with deep-sea field trial data originated from oil & gas commercial operations. © 2019 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), there is excessive growth of abnormal blood vessels in the eye (choroidal neovascularization), eventually leading to vision loss due to detachment of retinal pigmented epithelium. As the advanced stage of this disease involves loss of retinal pigmented epithelium, much less attention has been given to early vascular events such as endothelial dysfunction. Although current gold standard therapy using inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have achieved initial successes, some drawbacks include the lack of long-term restoration of visual acuity, as well as a subset of the patients being refractory to existing treatment, alluding us and others to hypothesize upon VEGF-independent mechanisms. Against this backdrop, we present here a nonexhaustive review on the vascular underpinnings of AMD, implications with genetic and systemic factors, experimental models for studying choroidal neovascularization, and interestingly, on both endothelial-centric pathways and noncell autonomous mechanisms. We hope to shed light on future research directions in improving vascular function in ocular disorders. © 2019 Yeo, Chan and Cheung.","Review","Final","Scopus"

An end-to-end approach attempts to achieve autonomous driving using a single, comprehensive software component. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have significantly increased end-to-end systems’ capabilities, and such systems are now considered a possible alternative to the current state-of-the-art solutions. This paper examines end-to-end learning for autonomous vehicles in simulated urban environments containing other vehicles, traffic lights, and speed limits. Furthermore, the paper explores end-to-end systems’ ability to execute navigational commands and examines whether improved performance can be achieved by utilizing temporal dependencies between subsequent visual cues. Two end-to-end architectures are proposed: a traditional Convolutional Neural Network and an extended design combining a Convolutional Neural Network with a recurrent layer. The models are trained using expert driving data from a simulated urban setting, and are evaluated by their driving performance in an unseen simulated environment. The results of this paper indicate that end-to-end systems can operate autonomously in simple urban environments.

"Hidden Vehicle Sensing via Asynchronous V2V Transmission: A Multi-Path-Geometry Approach","2019","IEEE Access","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2954858","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077758219&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2954858&partnerID=40&md5=5571f15d3206175d8dcf4d7ecf23e939","Accurate vehicular sensing is a basic and important operation in autonomous driving. Unfortunately, the existing techniques have their own limitations. For instance, the communication-based approach (e.g., transmission of GPS information) has high latency and low reliability while the reflection-based approach (e.g., RADAR) is incapable of detecting hidden vehicles (HVs) without line-of-sight. This is arguably the reason behind some recent fatal accidents involving autonomous vehicles. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel HV-sensing technology that exploits multi-path transmission from a HV to a sensing vehicle (SV). The powerful technology enables the SV to detect multiple HV-state parameters including position, orientation of driving direction, and size. Its implementation does not even require synchronization like conventional mobile positioning techniques. Our design approach leverages estimated information on multi-path [namely their angles-of-arrival (AoA), angles-of-departure (AoD), and time-of-arrival (ToA)] and their geometric relations. As a result, a complex system of equations or optimization problems, where the desired HV-state parameters are variables, can be formulated for different channel-noise conditions. The development of intelligent solution methods ranging from least-square estimator to disk/box minimization yields a set of practical HV-sensing techniques. We study their feasibility conditions in terms of the required number of paths. Furthermore, practical solutions, including sequential path combining and random directional beamforming, are proposed to enable HV-sensing given insufficient paths. Last, realistic simulation of driving in both highway and rural scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. In summary, the proposed technique will enhance the capabilities of existing vehicular sensing technologies (e.g., RADAR and LIDAR) by enabling HV-sensing. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

As one of the state-of-The-Art perception approaches, semantic segmentation unifies distinct detection tasks widely desired by both autonomous driving and security monitoring. Currently, semantic segmentation shows remarkable efficiency and reliability in standard scenarios such as daytime scenes with favorable illumination conditions. However, in face of adverse conditions such as the nighttime, semantic segmentation loses its accuracy significantly. One of the main causes of the problem is the lack of sufficient annotated segmentation datasets of nighttime scenes. In this paper, we propose a framework to alleviate the accuracy decline when semantic segmentation is taken to adverse conditions by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). To bridge the daytime and nighttime image domains, we made key observation that compared to datasets in adverse conditions, there are considerable amount of segmentation datasets in standard conditions such as BDD and our collected ZJU datasets. Our GAN-based nighttime semantic segmentation framework includes two methods. In the first method, GANs were used to translate nighttime images to the daytime, thus semantic segmentation can be performed using robust models already trained on daytime datasets. In another method, we use GANs to translate different ratio of daytime images in the dataset to the nighttime but still with their labels. In this sense, synthetic nighttime segmentation datasets can be generated to yield models prepared to operate at nighttime conditions robustly. In our experiment, the later method significantly boosts the performance at the nighttime evidenced by quantitative results using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Pixel Accuracy (Acc). We show that the performance varies with respect to the proportion of synthetic nighttime images in the dataset, where the sweet spot corresponds to most robust performance across the day and night. The proposed framework not only makes contribution to the optimization of visual perception in intelligent vehicles, but also can be applied to diverse navigational assistance systems. © 2019 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, their security has not been thoroughly assessed when deploying such models in practice, especially in those mission-critical tasks like autonomous driving. In this work, we draw attention to a new attack surface of DGMs, which is the data used in the training phase. We demonstrate that the training data poisoning, the injection of specially-crafted data, are able to teach Trojan behaviors to a DGM without influencing the original training goal. Such Trojan attack will be activated after model deployment only if certain rare triggers are present in an input. For example, a rain-removal DGM after poisoning can, while removing raindrops in input images, change a traffic light from red to green if this traffic light has a specific appearance (i.e. a trigger). Clearly severe consequences can occur if such poisoned model is deployed on vehicle. Our study shows that launching our Trojan attack is feasible on different DGM categories designed for the autonomous driving scenario, and existing defense methods cannot effectively defeat it. We also introduce a concealing technique to make our data poisoning more inconspicuous during the training.

Fully convolutional networks (FCN) have achieved remarkable performance on many image segmentation tasks, but water hazard detection problems are always hard to deal with due to the reflection characteristic of water. In this paper, we use Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) to deal with the water hazard detection. It has been proved that the Reflection Attention Unit (RAU) can improve the performance of deep networks for water hazard detection when added into the deep networks. We take advantage of RAU and carefully investigate its effect when placed in different layers of cGAN, with the best configuration being our proposed method: cGAN-mRAU. The 'Puddle-1000' dataset is employed to evaluate our method. We use two subsets respectively and combine them together. We randomly choose some images and their ground-truth masks to train the model, and we use other images to test the model.

Furthermore, a hybrid loss function is introduced, which consists of contextual loss and class-balanced focal loss, to enhance the performance of the network in cardiac US images.

However, it is a great challenge to generate a safe, stable and robust collision-free path for unmanned aircraft system (UAS), a.k.a. unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV), in real time, if the airspace is highly dynamics and heterogenous (i.e. thronged with aircrafts with different motion states). Based on the dynamic artificial potential field (DAPF) algorithm, this paper provides advisories on how to generate a real-time reactive collision-free path for unmanned aircraft vehicles flying in a dynamic airspace, aiming to ensure the flight safety and minimize the impact on surrounding traffic. Firstly, the safety distance was defined as a variable threshold, which scaled adaptively according to the relative motion states of the surrounding obstacles and the performance of the own UAV. Moreover, the forces of the potential field were improved, such that their magnitudes could be adjusted automatically according to the threat levels of the surrounding obstacles. The threat level of an obstacle depends on the relative position, speed and flight trend between the UAV and the obstacle. In addition, the repulsive force along the relative position of the traditional artificial potential field (APF) was retained, and a steering force was added to change the flight direction of the UAV, aiming to speed up the collision avoidance. Furthermore, the attractive force was modified to help the UAV return to the planned path quickly and stably.

The facility is equipped with a cable car and is ideal for slanted path experiments from the base station to the cable car where the sensors were mounted. NATO SET-249's background is laser threat evaluation and the evaluation of the impact of laser eye dazzle on the visual performance of humans. This work gives an overview on the various measurements performed here: 1. Assessment of dazzle effects originating from light scattering at an aircraft canopy by comparing the images of two cameras: one outside and one inside the canopy. The general findings showed that the canopy, which had been used previously on an aircraft, substantially affected the dazzle pattern in the camera within the canopy as compared to the camera outside. 2. Sensor dazzling: Laser dazzling of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) cameras in the visible domain and, in addition, laser dazzling of a camera equipped with a fisheye lens, which is commonly present in micro-unmanned aerial vehicles, is demonstrated. The dazzled area in the camera field of view (FoV) grows with increasing laser irradiance, and dazzling is effective at irradiance levels around a few μW/cm2. 3. An overview on realistic handheld laser engagement scenarios to test the capabilities of a DSTL-developed Laser Event Recorder (LER) is provided. This technology is able to detect continuous wave (CW) and pulsed lasers, and extract their wavelengths, irradiances, Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) and directionality. Applications for this LER include collecting information on aircraft laser exposure events, giving information to assess if engagements are eye safe. 4. Measurements performed on various Fraunhofer IOSB developed sensor systems hardened against laser dazzle: The hardening measure of these systems is based either on the use of spatial light modulators or on the implementation of the principle of complementary wavelength bands. The field trial offered the possibility to generate data of the hardened systems under real life conditions. © 2019 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Their low cost, flexibility of use, low service cost and independence on infrastructure make them ideal carriers of different cargo. This fact brings many significant safety risk and threats. Especially aerial survey, flight zones disruptions and transport dangerous cargo. Above mentioned threat can be eliminated by: disabling navigation and control features, taking control over the steering and object destruction. One of the possible typically military solutions of that situation, is destruction by shooting. The most common way of solving the above task, is the use of barrel weapons of individual shooter or small military units. Therefore, we focused our effort on preventing the UAV mission accomplishing by its shooting destruction. To accomplish the task, in addition to detection and identification, we consider the distance determination as a fundamental problem. For the purposes of this paper, the distance determination we consider as a ""localization"". Comparison of UAV localization options is the issue of this paper. Two localizations methods have been defined. Localization option include active method (ILR - impulse laser rangefinder) and passive method (triangulation method). Using mathematical modelling we proved, that ILR measurement is possible. To determine a distance with a defined probability we designed specific measurement frequency. For a predetermined type of UAV and ILR we identified the maximum distance that can be measured. In the second part of this paper, we analyzed the accuracy of localization using the triangulation method. The accuracy of localization using this method is dependent on the squared of the UAV distance. There are two significant advantage of this method: measurements can be made continuously and multiple objects in the field of view can be measured at the same time. This article is part of a planned publishing activity dealing with the issue. © 2019 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In order to heighten the security of such public spaces as well, and in order to prevent an impending attack from taking place, surveillance and observation devices could serve as an early-warning system enabling us to initiate counter-measures. Currently, CCTV systems as well as ‘Smart’ CCTV systems offer us this opportunity – which is why in this chapter, I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of such systems, to then take a critical look at Augmented Reality (Mixed Reality) as an up-and-coming tool in the fight against terrorism (and criminality in general).

A wide range of sensors, including LiDAR, RADAR, cameras, and so on, are used to build the perception layer of an autonomous vehicle. Many interfaces, such as OBD-II, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks, etc., have been introduced in autonomous vehicles to control various functionalities, including V2X communications, over-the-air updates, security, remote vehicle-health monitoring, and so on. These interfaces are introducing new attack surfaces that can be exploited via external as well as internal attacks. Attackers have successfully demonstrated how to exploit these attack surfaces by crafting attack vectors to launch both insider and external attacks. The sensor and sensor data are also vulnerable to both external and insider attacks. Developing safeguards against these attacks is a steppingstone toward the design and development of reliable autonomous vehicles. For instance, failure to detect and localize sensor data tampering can result in an erroneous perception of the environment and lead to wrong path-planning and control decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-fragile data hiding-based technique for real-time sensor data integrity verification and tamper detection and localization. Specifically, the proposed data hiding-based method relies on 3-dimensional quantization index modulation (QIM)-based data hiding to insert a binary watermark into the LiDAR data at the sensing layer, which is used for integrity verification and tamper detection and localization at the decision-making unit, e.g., the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated on a benchmarking LiDAR dataset. The impact of information hiding on the object-recognition algorithm is also evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can successfully detect and localize data tampering attacks, such as fake object insertion (FOI) and target object deletion (TOD). Robustness to noise-addition attacks is also evaluated. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It is a complicated optimization problem in which target assignment and path planning are solved separately. However, recalculation of the optimal results is too slow for real-time operations in dynamic environments because of the large number of calculations required. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence method named simultaneous target assignment and path planning (STAPP) based on a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm, which is a type of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. In STAPP, the MUTAPP problem is first constructed as a multi-agent system. Then, the MADDPG framework is used to train the system to solve target assignment and path planning simultaneously according to a corresponding reward structure. The proposed system can deal with dynamic environments effectively as its execution only requires the locations of the UAVs, targets, and threat areas. Real-time performance can be guaranteed as the neural network used in the system is simple. In addition, we develop a technique to improve the training effect and use experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. © 2019 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The main idea of this work is to operate on a multidisciplinary level to identify propeller shapes that lead to reduced tip vortex-induced pressure and increased efficiency without altering the thrust. First, a specific tool for the bottom-up construction of parameterized propeller blade geometries has been developed. The algorithm proposed operates with a user defined number of arbitrary shaped or NACA airfoil sections, and employs arbitrary degree NURBS to represent the chord, pitch, skew and rake distribution as a function of the blade radial coordinate. The control points of such curves have been modified to generate, in a fully automated way, a family of blade geometries depending on as many as 20 shape parameters. Such geometries have then been used to carry out potential flow simulations with the Boundary Element Method based software PROCAL. Given the high number of parameters considered, such a preliminary stage allowed for a fast evaluation of the performance of several hundreds of shapes. In addition, the data obtained from the potential flow simulation allowed for the application of a parameter space reduction methodology based on active subspaces (AS) property, which suggested that the main propeller performance indices are, at a first but rather accurate approximation, only depending on a single parameter which is a linear combination of all the original geometric ones. AS analysis has also been used to carry out a constrained optimization exploiting response surface method in the reduced parameter space, and a sensitivity analysis based on such surrogate model. The few selected shapes were finally used to set up high fidelity RANS simulations and select an optimal shape. © 2019 The Authors.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Their advantage is a relatively low cost compared to typical aircraft constructions. The UAV equipment in recording devices allows them to be used for surveying, volumetric measurements, vegetation index calculations (including the normalized difference vegetation index) and thermovision analyzes. Due to the high resolution, the materials obtained from UAV can be a source of information, among others for designers, hydrologists, geomorphologists, geologists and others. The acquired images may also be subject to advanced analyzes using, among others, methods of artificial intelligence. The article presents the results of the analysis of photos acquired during a mission over the exploited sand pit. The aim of the research was to check if low-ceiling photogrammetry would be useful to assess the quality of a sand deposit. The results of geological surveys were taken into account in addition to the photos obtained from the UAV. FLIR Tools software was used for analysis, as well as specialized algorithms based on OpenCV software. We plan that the final goal will be to develop a methodology for performing non-invasive measurements to enable monitoring of the deposit. The method used allows remote sensing of the electromagnetic radiation interaction with the examined matter. Part of the radiation is selectively absorbed, reflected or transmitted. A bandwidth compatible with the characteristics of our camera was used for remote sensing. We assume the use of other cameras to measure other frequency ranges. The basic measure is the spectral reflection coefficient, which defines the quotient of energy reflected to the electromagnetic spectrum falling in the given range. The function of the spectral reflection coefficient from the wavelength is the spectral reflection curve, also referred to as spectral characteristic. The spectral properties of the tested deposit depend on the structure, morphology and properties of the deposit. The collected information was analyzed using several available methods by selecting the optimal genetic algorithm and neural networks to analyze the obtained data. The aim of the measurements is guided by the idea of proper interpretation of the obtained results and implementation of them in the form of ready-made patterns related to the researched fields. In comparison to the results obtained in a conventional way, the presented method is less expensive and allows for commercial implementation. The aim of the research is to build a model that would define the dependence of the factors studied. Then, based on the constructed model, it will allow to obtain a correlation between the occurring values and the measured parameters. The model will allow for the commercial use of research and reduction of the implementation costs of measurements. The spectral detection method will in many cases replace the previous measurement techniques, providing a lot of valuable information in a very short time. Measurements are easy to make and unstructured, and the available measuring instrument is relatively cheap. The mentioned advantages of the measurement and indirect evaluation of the status of the studied fields are the reasons to choose this method of measurement as a secondary study tool. An important aspect, in addition to the measurement itself, is the development of indicators and their interpretation based on the data obtained. It will be possible to use the method in other geological application areas. Here, the users of the method will be the owners of opencast mining plants and the bodies of geological and mining administration. © SGEM2019.

In order to improve the performance of antijamming capability of a millimeter-wave radar, the suppression of interference using random functions is widely used in current applications. However, the main limitation of this method is that it lack a mechanism to withstand message replaying attack, forgery attack, Masquerade attack, and guessing and stolen verifier attack. In this paper, we propose an antijamming method based on a hash function to provide a secure antijamming solution with a stronger ability to suppress the interference echoes and flexible controls. The associated techniques include digital radio frequency memory (DRFM), millimeter-wave radar, and hash value processing. Three types of experiments are performed to achieve 32.87%38.34% improvement in terms of the peak difference between the true and false targets, and the results are reported and analyzed in this paper. In each of the experiments, different variables are tested by the controlled variable method, and the experimental results are compared. On this occasion, it is concluded that the modulation signal based on the hash function has a stronger ability to suppress the interference echoes than that based on the pseudorandom function. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become more ubiquitous, the manipulation of GPS capable UAVs is becoming a greater threat to their use. One method of mitigating these attacks employs the use of multiple antenna arrays. These arrays are utilized in many GPS dependent systems. These GPS capable UAVs using multiple antennas are restricted to a short baseline multi-antenna system similar to Controlled Reception Pattern Arrays (CRPA) sizes. Differential GPS measurements are used for Angle of Arrival (AOA) calculations which are used to locate the threat in question. The AOA estimations and attitude are a function of the baseline of the multi-antenna array in use. This paper explores the analysis of multiple antenna baselines and the impact the chosen baseline length has on the estimation of the electronic threat location. Previously, threat locations have been estimated as shown in work by Gray, Thompson, Mahmood and others. Numerous papers focusing on geolocation of threats show results of long (defined as greater than carrier phase wavelength) baseline geolocation. Gray's work focuses on AOA techniques involving a larger baseline array, which is not feasible on a compact UAV. The work done by Gray also focuses on a 2-dimensional system and does not reference any elevation change between emitter and receiver. Work done by Costa focuses on an aerial platform but uses a large baseline. Costa's AOA estimation methods are evaluated with a system with one wavelength spacing between antennas. Ina addition to publications on large baseline arrays, there have been several publications focusing on uniform linear arrays and geolocation accuracy, as from Zahemia and Huang, but these do not consider the three dimensional geolocation. Prior work by Corderio shows different forms of UAV attitude estimation on a short baseline array but also includes additional sensors in the solution for the system. While different baselines are considered in Corderio's work, his solutions are focused on the fusion of multiple sensors and not the impact the baseline has. A primary motivator for this paper is the fact that UAVs typically have a very limited capacity for additional electronics. As weight is added, power consumption of the UAV increases as flight times and speeds decrease. Keeping these limitations in mind, a multi-antenna system can become constrained by size and weight limitations on the given platform. This motivates using as few antennas as possible to minimize weight and explore the impact of baseline on the geolocation of threats. In addition to the effects of the baseline, UAVs using pathfinding designed to avoid electronic threats can still fall victim to the attack if the uncertainty of the geolocation is not considered. In addition to commercial use, this geolocation system could be law enforcement searching for threats. The uncertainty of the location of the threat is vital for law enforcement's ability to locate and disable the source of the interference. This paper explores the impact the array has on geolocation. An antenna array capable of GPS attitude solutions is the only form of navigation sensor used. For the purpose of the paper, the baseline from antenna to antenna is limited from ten percent of the GPS L1 wavelength to just under the GPS L1 wavelength. The carrier phase differences between antenna pairs are the measurements used for the attitude to keep the attitude solution dependent on the same measurements. The attitude solution is solved in a least squares estimation resulting in the relative rotation of Euler angles from the body frame to the East North Up frame (ENU). The attitude of the UAV is solved after each GPS update. After producing an attitude solution, AOA estimation methods are used on the antenna array signals to produce AOAs for the observed signals. An assumption made here is the detection of the invalid signal has been done successfully. The invalid signal is then assumed as being excluded from the position and attitude solutions returning the system to a similar state before the threat is introduced. The AOA estimation is produced in the body frame of the UAV. The attitude estimation previously solved is combined with the AOA estimation and transformed to the global frame to be used in a least squares estimation across multiple time steps. The position, attitude and AOA errors are combined to create a threat geolocation error as a function of antenna baseline. The results of the geolocation confidence should be quantified by the standard deviation of the combined results. This standard deviation should be shown as a function of the antenna baselines. This information can be used in system design for autonomous UAVs and threat location devices to find the capabilities and limitations of the systems being designed. © 2019, Institute of Navigation.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Shooting without control by a human operator has military advantages, but also disadvantages – human understanding of the situation and control of events would suffer. Beyond this, compliance with the law of armed conflict is in question. Would it be ethical to allow a machine to take a human life? The increased pace of battle may overburden human understanding and decision making and lead to uncontrolled escalation. An international campaign as well as IT, robotics and AI professionals and enterprises are calling for an international ban of AWS. States have discussed about limitations in the UN context, but no consensus has evolved so far. Germany has argued for a ban of fully autonomous weapons, but has not joined the countries proposing an AWS ban, and is using a problematic definition. An international ban could comprise a prohibition of AWS and a requirement that each use of force must be under meaningful human control (with very few exceptions). If remotely controlled uninhabited weapon systems remain allowed, a-priori verification that they cannot attack under computer control is virtually impossible. Compliance could be proved after the fact by secure records of all communication and sensor data and the actions of the human operator. The AI and robotics communities could make significant contributions in teaching and by engaging the public and decision makers. Specific research projects could be directed, e.g., at dual use, proliferation risks and scenarios of interaction between two fleets of AWS. Because of high military, political and economic interests in AWS, a ban needs support by an alert public as well as the AI and robotics communities. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

They threaten human health by disease transfer and impact economies by causing agricultural damage. On island landscapes, they are frequent predators of native species and affect biodiversity. To provide managers with better information regarding methods to suppress commensal rodent populations in remote island forests, in 2016 we evaluated the effectiveness of continuous rat trapping using snap-traps, Goodnature® A24 self-resetting rat traps, and a 1-time (2-application) hand-broadcast of anticoagulant rodenticide bait pellets (Diphacinone-50) applied at 13.8 kg/ha per application in a 5-ha forest on Oahu, Hawaii, USA. We compared rat and mouse abundance at the rat trapping site to a reference site by monitoring rodent tracking tunnels, which are baited ink cards in tunnels that allow footprints of animal visitors to be identified. We found that trapping reduced rat, but not mouse, abundance. The rodenticide treatment did not further reduce rat populations (P = 0.139), but temporarily reduced the mouse populations (P < 0.001; from 33% tracking to 0% for 1.3 months).

In these conditions, conventional sensor suites could be augmented with additional flow-sensing to extend the aircraft’s usable flight envelope. Inspired by distributed sensor arrays in biological systems, a UAS with a chordwise array of pressure sensors was developed. Wind-tunnel testing characterized these sensors alongside a conventional airspeed sensor and an angle-of-attack (AoA) vane, and showed a single pressure measurement gave a linear response to AoA prestall. Flight tests initially manually piloted the vehicle through pitching maneuvers, then in a series of automated maneuvers based on closed-loop feedback using an estimate of AoA from the single pressure port. The AoA estimate was successfully used to control the attitude of the aircraft. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to estimate the AoA and airspeed using all pressure ports in the array, and validated using flight-trial data.

In this paper, we consider an algorithm for sending Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) between vehicles in a CAV system and the use of CAMs in preventing vehicle collisions. We employ threat analysis techniques that are commonly used in the cyber security domain to guide our formal verification. This allows us to focus our formal methods on those security properties that are particularly important and to consider both safety and security in tandem.

To avoid such incidents in future, it is essential to be able to detect UAVs. However, not every UAV is a potential threat and therefore the UAV not only has to be detected, but classified or identified. 360o scanning LiDAR systems can be deployed for the detection and tracking of (micro) UAVs in ranges up to 50 m. Unfortunately, the verification and classification of the detected objects is not possible in most cases, due to the low resolution of that kind of sensor. In this paper, we propose an automatic alignment of an additional sensor (mounted on a pan-tilt head) for the identification of the detected objects. The classification sensor is directed by the tracking results of the panoramic LiDAR sensor. If the alignable sensor is an RGB- or infrared camera, the identification of the objects can be done by state-of-the-art image processing algorithms. If a higher-resolution LiDAR sensor is used for this task, algorithms have to be developed and implemented. For example, the classification could be realized by a 3D model matching method. After the handoff of the object position from the 360o LiDAR to the verification sensor, this second system can be used for a further tracking of the object, e.g., if the trajectory of the UAV leaves the field of view of the primary LiDAR system. The paper shows first results of this multi-sensor classification approach. © 2019 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

A fast and efficient framework for pedestrian detection and trajectory estimation for outdoor surveillance using thermal images is presented in this paper. First, the detection process is based on a conjunction between contrast enhancement techniques and saliency maps as a hotspot detector, on Discrete Chebychev Moments (DCM) as a global image content descriptor and on a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. Second, raw H.264/AVC compressed video streams with limited computational overhead are exploited to estimate the trajectories of the detected pedestrians.

Installation of a robotic first aid system for passenger car occupants has been proposed. This paper discusses the general situation in the automotive industry pertaining to healthcare in medical emergencies. It presents the top priorities in new-car purchase with regards to vehicle safety and delves into the health emergencies that occur in passenger cars. The prevalence and effectiveness of existing forms of response to the emergencies are also discussed. Autonomous driving and its implications on vehicle safety is reviewed, along with the challenges the technology faces. Likewise, the use of robots in human surgical procedures and challenges faced by the field is discussed. Finally, robotic first aid as a research area is investigated. Findings indicate that vehicle safety is a top priority in new-car purchase. Besides trauma in road traffic accidents, car occupants also face non-trauma emergencies such as stroke or heart attack. For areas with effective emergency medical services, the greatest delays in responding to emergencies come from the reaction of patients and bystanders. Results also show that, in comparison to the myriad of faults human drivers exhibit while driving, computers are the ideal motorists. Likewise, robots show strong potential to transcend the limitations of human healthcare in surgical procedures. Like autonomous vehicle technology, robotic surgery is marred with scientific, legislative and socioeconomic challenges, but it is evident that the idea of robotics and artificial intelligence envisaged in the concepts seems to be in the right direction for public health. It is concluded that the passenger car robotic first aid system should be developed, making considerations for challenges already faced in autonomous driving and robotic surgery technologies. © 2019 The Authors.

An infamous example is the Jeep hack which allowed an attacker to remotely control the car engine by just exploiting a software bug in the infotainment system. The digitalization and connectivity of modern cars demands a rethinking of car safety as security breaches now affect the driver’s safety. To address the new threat landscape, we develop a novel concept that simultaneously addresses both car safety and security based on the arising blockchain technology, which we mainly exploit to ensure integrity. Previous related work exploited the blockchain for the purpose of forensics, where vehicle data is stored on an externally shared ledger that is accessible by authorized third parties. However, those approaches cannot ensure integrity of information used by the vehicle’s components. In contrast, we propose a blockchain-based architecture based on a shared ledger inside the car, where each ECU can act as a miner and shares its information with other ECUs. The architecture does not only improve the integrity of information for forensics. Some algorithms, e.g. the recognition of dangerous situations, are adaptive and can be improved using for example sensor data. Using our architecture, we ensure that those algorithms only take verified and correct information as input. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In these applications, the active source is used to provide photons but also to code and decode relevant information such as range or spectral response. The wavelengths of choice range from visible to millimeter waves depending on the application and associated requirements. Across these wavelengths, the targets range from Lambertian to specular. For single element and scanned systems, ranging is commonly modeled using conventions borrowed from the radar and antenna community. Staring and scanning systems that facilitate resolution in the cross-range are modeled using conventions borrowed from the synthetic aperture radar community or the passive imaging community. All the borrowed conventions, however, make assumptions about the size and nature of the target in relationship to the illumination and wavelength, unresolved versus resolved and Lambertian versus specular. These assumptions are relevant for the calculation of system signal to noise ratio and resolution; therefore, they should be carefully considered when adopting the conventions. Examples of systems where modeling falls between active radar and passive imaging include wide band Terahertz array imaging systems and solid state lidar systems. This paper generalizes and bridges the models used by the active radar community and the passive imaging community. We apply the model to a wide band terahertz array imaging system enabled by terahertz array technology recently developed at imec.

Among the various fields of application, recently, the use of drones in the precision agriculture is becoming much relevant for the researchers community. The studies related to agriculture concern different aspects such as livestock monitoring, crops and water levels. The drones are able to perform these tasks thank to a series of different sensors and actuators equipped on board. Cameras on board allow, through opportune algorithms, the gathering of detailed information about plants health. If a health problem is detected then the the drone can intervene precisely on the specific problem. The contribution of this work is a communication protocols analysis applied to the problem of controlling a fleet of drones against parasites attacks to the crops. Moreover, the study of the different approaches aims to measure their performance and costs. In particular, the various approaches face also the issues of exploring the area in the shortest time possible avoiding that the same area is explored from more drones, discovering the parasites and preventing their proliferation spraying the right quantity of pesticide. The drones, being equipped with limited quantities of both fuel and pesticide, can ask for help to other drones to complete the elimination of the parasites. To face these last issues some recruitment protocols have been tested, focusing on bio-inspired one. © 2019 SPIE.

However, most of the quarries are operating without topographic plans due to a lack of surveying activities. This paper introduces an approach of using low-cost UAVs to produce digital surface models which in turn are used to draw topographic maps of quarries in Vietnam. For assessments of accuracy, safety, and working efficiency, four quarries different in terrain conditions, namely Luong Son, Long Son, Nui Nho, and Nui Dai were selected as the study areas. Ground control points were established in each area by using GNSS/RTK for camera calibration and accuracy assessment. The accuracy of DSM was assessed using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) in X, Y, Z, XY, and XYZ components. Capturing images from each site were processed by using Agisoft®PhotoScan Professional 1.5.2. The results showed that all the DSM models of the four areas have high accuracy, RMSE on the checked GCPs ranges from 1.0 to 9.0 cm, from 1.2 to 5.0 cm, from 4.4 to 13.4 cm, from 1.6 to 10.3 cm, and from 4.9 to 16.9 cm for X, Y, Z, XY, XYZ components, respectively.

The present consensus is that reasonable levels of autonomy, such as for self-driving cars or autonomous drones, can only be reached with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms that cope with the uncertainties of the real world. That makes safety assurance even more challenging than it already is in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with classically programmed control, precisely because AI techniques are lauded for their flexibility in handling unpredictable situations, but are themselves harder to predict. This paper identifies the logical path toward autonomous cyber-physical systems in multiple steps. First, differential dynamic logic () provides a logical foundation for developing cyber-physical system models with the mathematical rigor that their safety-critical nature demands. Then, its ModelPlex technique provides a logically correct way to tame the subtle relationship of CPS models to CPS implementations. Finally, the resulting logical monitor conditions can then be exploited to safeguard the decisions of learning agents, guide the optimization of learning processes, and resolve the nondeterminism frequently found in verification models. Overall, logic leads the way in combining the best of both worlds: the strong predictions that formal verification techniques provide alongside the strong flexibility that the use of AI provides. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Original method of nature management conflicts analysis and mapping was used. It was based on revealing of potential competing exploitation of ecosystem services regulating, production, cultural. System analysis and mapping methods were used as well. The revealed areas of potential nature management conflicts must be taken into consideration during territorial management plans development. © 2019 Lomonosov Moscow State University.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of motor vehicle pollution on lung function, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and cognitive function among students studying in a school located in a traffic-polluted area. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, students were recruited based on their apparent healthy status, same age, gender, height, weight, ethnicity, and homogenous educational, socio-economic status, and living backgrounds. Initially, 200 students, 100 from school-1 located in motor vehicle polluted area (exposed group) and 100 from school-2, located away from motor vehicle polluted area (control group) were recruited. After clinical history, 68 students were selected, 34 from school-1 and 34 from school-2. These students were exposed to motor vehicle pollution for 6 h a day, 5 days a week for a total period of 2 years. Lung function test parameters were recorded using a Spirometer, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was measured by Niox Mino, and cognitive function was recorded using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). RESULTS: The lung function test parameters, Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) (p=0.03); Forced Expiratory Volume in First Second (FEV1) (p=0.02); and cognitive function parameter motor screening task (MOT) mean latency (p=0.04) were decreased among the students who were studying in school situated in traffic-polluted area compared to those students who were studying in school which was located away from the traffic-polluted area. However, no significant difference was noted in FeNO between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Motor vehicle pollution showed an association with decreased respiratory and cognitive functions among students studying in schools located in traffic-polluted areas. Environmental protection organizations must establish standards to minimize motor vehicle pollutants and develop strategies to control vehicle emission to reduce pollution and disease burden. © 2019 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

The few Bayesian RL methods that are applicable in partially observable domains, such as the Bayes-Adaptive POMDP (BA-POMDP), scale poorly. To address this issue, we introduce the Factored BA-POMDP model (FBA-POMDP), a framework that is able to learn a compact model of the dynamics by exploiting the underlying structure of a POMDP. The FBA-POMDP framework casts the problem as a planning task, for which we adapt the Monte-Carlo Tree Search planning algorithm and develop a belief tracking method to approximate the joint posterior over the state and model variables. Our empirical results show that this method outperforms a number of BRL baselines and is able to learn efficiently when the factorization is known, as well as learn both the factorization and the model parameters simultaneously. © 2019 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

Specifically, the attention is focused on a radar prototype installed on a small unmanned aerial vehicle (S-UAV), previously proposed by few of the authors. In particular, the challenges in terms of electromagnetic modeling and flight dynamics knowledge and control are here tackled. In this frame, an ad-hoc designed data processing strategy is presented; this strategy involves a pre-processing step and a reconstruction step. The pre-processing is performed in time domain and, beyond filtering procedures commonly exploited in radar imaging, involves a procedure devoted to compensate flight altitude variations and to account for the S-UAV trajectory, which is estimated by processing measurements collected by an onboard GPS receiver. In addition, the reconstruction of the investigated scenario is performed by means of a microwave tomographic approach based on a linear model of the electromagnetic scattering and the concept of equivalent dielectric permittivity for the propagation path. This latter allows us to properly face the imaging of buried objects, while avoiding the mathematical complexity introduced by the presence of the air-medium interface. Accordingly, the imaging is faced as a linear inverse scattering problem formulated in the spatial domain similarly to the case of a homogeneous scenario and, thanks to the concept of equivalent permittivity, depth and horizontal position of buried objects are retrieved properly. This is corroborated by means of a numerical analysis accounting for synthetic data. © 2019 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

We trained our models from scratch by generating training data with threat image projection (TIP) that alleviates the class imbalance problem inherent to the x-ray security inspection and eliminates the need for costly and tedious staged data collection. The method is tested on unseen weapons that are also injected into unseen cargo images using TIP. Variations in cargo content and background clutter is considered in training and testing datasets.

The number of UAV has growth exponentially due to rise in applications such as video taking, surveillance and delivering cargo to customers. Despite the promise of the technology, UAV are not fully reliable currently, either civil or military. They lack of sensing mechanisms to detect issues in operation, such as impacts, hard landings and overload, together with the difficulties to detect structural problems during the UAV operation could compromise not only the safety of the UAV, also all along the entire flying area. This paper presents the design, development implementation, and validation of a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system applied to the rear fuselage of the UAV developed by INTA for R&D activities (MILANO). The rear fuselage, a 2.5 meters carbon/epoxy structure with frames and stringers, was instrumented with fiber optic sensors and PZT. Two different types of fiber optic sensors (FOS) were considered: Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG) and distributed fiber sensing based on Rayleigh backscatter. The objective of the fiber optic sensor network is to detect the changes induced on the strain field due to damage appearance. Different algorithms, such PCA and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) will be discussed. Validation will be performed with measurements on a real structure with increasing damages by removing rivets progressively at different load levels. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), will be proposed for accurate damage detection with the FBG sensing network in real time operations. © International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring.

For decades, threats posed to civil aviation by outsiders have been associated with their presence and a physical attempt to force various types of security and regulations. Currently, this situation is changing. As it is commonly known, people trying to jeopardize this mode of transport are a step ahead of regulations and security services.

In the advent of the post-genomic era, the next generation sequencing is done routinely at the population scale for a variety of species. The challenging problem is to massively determine the functions of proteins that are yet not characterized by detailed experimental studies. Identification of protein functions experimentally is a laborious and time-consuming task involving many resources. We therefore propose the automated protein function prediction methodology using in silico algorithms trained on carefully curated experimental datasets. We present the improved protein function prediction tool FunPred 3.0, an extended version of our previous methodology FunPred 2, which exploits neighborhood properties in protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) and physicochemical properties of amino acids. Our method is validated using the available functional annotations in the PPIN network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the latest Munich information center for protein (MIPS) dataset. The PPIN data of S. cerevisiae in MIPS dataset includes 4,554 unique proteins in 13,528 protein-protein interactions after the elimination of the self-replicating and the self-interacting protein pairs. Using the developed FunPred 3.0 tool, we are able to achieve the mean precision, the recall and the F-score values of 0.55, 0.82 and 0.66, respectively. FunPred 3.0 is then used to predict the functions of unpredicted protein pairs (incomplete and missing functional annotations) in MIPS dataset of S. cerevisiae. The method is also capable of predicting the subcellular localization of proteins along with its corresponding functions.

The method can locate the faults when UAV swarms are suffering physical damages or signal attacks.

Especially in the field of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) their incorporation has recently raised attention as they allow to recognize a spoofy GNSS signal through a comparison of its spatial information measured at the antenna elements of the array with the decoded information from the satellite ephemeris data. If they do not match, the spoofer can be mitigated by pointing a null in its direction. For that purpose, the attitude of the array in the coordinate system of the ephemeris data is required to be known. Especially in the field of automated and connected driving driving, both aforementioned types of disturbances have to be detected and mitigated to ensure a continuously safe and reliable operation. Therefore, compact antenna arrays, such as conventional uniform rectangular arrays (URA), where the distance between adjacent antenna elements does not exceed half a carrier wavelength, are commonly used. A significant drawback is posed by the large size of such arrays, which impedes the installation in the consumer automotive area, where an aesthetic design is a unique selling point and hence strictly followed by industry. This paper emphasizes a new approach, where the conventional URA is split into uniform linear arrays (ULA), whose size allow for a hidden installation in the front and rear bumper of a car, which would otherwise not provide enough space for the entire large URA. Thereby the new array violates two assumptions, which are valid for compact arrays: The distance between adjacent antennas can reach up to the length of the car, resulting in spacings of 20 - 30 carrier wavelengths. Furthermore, the metallic car body, which carries and affects the array, has a severe impact on the received signal power levels, which can no longer be assumed to be equal at all antenna elements. There are mainly two established methods for GNSS-based attitude determination: On the one hand, there are methods developed for and tested on compact arrays, whose operation has not been tested on configurations as the proposed array, where the aforementioned assumptions are violated. On the other hand, there are real time kintematic (RTK) based approaches, which are utilizing double-differences of phase measurements from distributed GNSS receivers, which instead lack the possibility to mitigate interferences. Therefore, this paper presents an approach to determine the attitude of the newly proposed spatially distributed array, thereby providing the ability to use spatial signal processing techniques for interference mitigation and hence providing robustness in degraded environments. The accuracy of the algorithm is tested in a realistic scenario using a measurement of the manifold of the proposed array configuration mounted onto a car. © 2019, Institute of Navigation.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Previously, the focus of the project, an unmanned aerial system (UAS) known as JAGER, has been on the development of a system capable of localizing a single static radio frequency interference (RFI) source [1]. JAGER is a UAS comprised of three main systems: the sensor to measure the bearing to the interference source, the localization system responsible for estimating the source location, and a path planning system to fly the vehicle in a way to minimize the cost of localization (typically thought of as the time to localize a source within a threshold) [2]. This works presents an analysis of the capabilities of the sensor, a phased array antenna, in an environment with multiple RFI sources. Understanding the sensor capabilities is key to being able to choose the right approach for localization and path planning. The introduction of additional interference sources poses a key challenge on the sensor’s ability to detect and measure the bearing to multiple sources simultaneously from a single receive signal strength (RSS) pattern. This paper presents a characterization and theoretical analysis of the performance of a 3-, 7-, and 19-element array in an environment with multiple interference sources. The difference in beamwidths of the different array sizes and side lobe suppression result in biases in the bearing measurements for the smaller arrays, while the larger arrays come at additional size, weight, and monetary costs, creating a set of tradeoffs to be considered for a system to localize multiple RFI sources from a UAS. To detect multiple sources, JAGER uses an onboard beam steering antenna to generate an RSS pattern (by measuring signal strength). For each RSS pattern, the bearing to each of the lobes detected is determined using the 3dB method used for bearing determination to a single source [3]. The theoretical performance of this method is evaluated in two different simulated multi-source environments. Finally, some design constraints are presented for the bearing sensor for detecting multiple sources based on the desired angular separation capabilities. © ION 2019.All right reserved.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

As a result, monitoring and estimating different network conditions such as speed and travel times based on this data have been proven to be greatly beneficial. However, there have been comparatively limited studies on extracting other critical traffic flow variables such as density and flow. These limited number of studies mostly develop algorithms to extract and exploit the somewhat regular patterns solely in fully stopped regions of the congested traffic. This paper proposes a more generalized microscopic approach that is applicable to a wider range of traffic conditions. A naïve Bayes model is implemented to estimate the number of unobserved vehicles in between a set of probe vehicles. The parameters needed for the naïve Bayes include means and standard deviations for the probability density functions (pdfs) for the distance headways between vehicles. The proposed model is tested based on the trajectory data collected from US 101 and I-80 in California for the FHWA's NGSIM (next generation simulation) project.

Deployment in a real environment necessitates the explainability and inspectability of the algorithms controlling the vehicle. Such insightful explanations are relevant not only for legal issues and insurance matters but also for engineers and developers in order to achieve provable functional quality guarantees. This applies to all scenarios where the results of deep networks control potentially life threatening machines. We suggest the use of a tiered approach, whose main component is a semantic segmentation model, over an end-to-end approach for an autonomous driving system. In order for a system to provide meaningful explanations for its decisions it is necessary to give an explanation about the semantics that it attributes to the complex sensory inputs that it perceives. In the context of high-dimensional visual input this attribution is done as a pixel-wise classification process that assigns an object class to every pixel in the image. This process is called semantic segmentation. We propose an architecture that delivers real-time viable segmentation performance and which conforms to the limitations in computational power that is available in production vehicles. The output of such a semantic segmentation model can be used as an input for an interpretable autonomous driving system. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

The UAVs and ground EOD robots were successfully used in the fight against terror over the past decade [8]. The military services have experienced the benefit of the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) in conducting dangerous and life-threatening tasks. To achieve national security aims, each country improves its defense power by integrating new systems [9, 11, 16, 20]. Today the use of ground robots is saving lives throughout the world. Moreover, the future robots will be expanded on the capabilities of the current series of robots, as well as take on additional, more generalized functions within a unit. This research deals with the light unmanned ground vehicle EOD and C-IED robot platform parameter assessment and its effectiveness evaluation. For these investigations, the estimation methods are based on technical specifications of four light UGVs EOD robots. The IBM SPSS 20 software and the agglomerative hierarchical clustering techniques to classify the UGVs EOD robots by the current structure was used. The collected data before analysis was additionally standardized, and all variable measurements were changed to z-values. Furthermore, there were examined the relationships between UGVs EOD C-IED robots mobility platform components: platform dimensions measurement (LxWxH), weight with wheels, max payload weight, speed, vertical obstacle, stair climbing ability and etc. © 2019 Kaunas University of Technology.

The introduction of Cyber Medicine enables physicians and soldiers to utilize technologies including mobile apps, robotics, connectivity to wired/wireless networks, satellites, clouds, HPCs, and software to identify, assess and treat the injured. However, what happens when the adversary attacks the cyber domain in addition to the physical domain? The answer could be that all automated systems will become suspect whether they are embedded systems, information processing systems, diagnosis and triage systems, or remote surgical robotics. This analysis identifies areas where the intelligent Cyber-Medical System can provide better healthcare to the battlefield including services to the disadvantaged soldier at the edge. Architecting intelligent systems starts with learning the desired system operation, sifting through historical data and procedure outcomes, assessing vulnerabilities, then delivering systems that mimics and augment human performance to solve problems. The battlefield Cybermedicine has the challenge of increased cyber security risks due to the need to be deployed in hostile environment, and the challenge of dealing with injuries that are unique to the battlefield. Moreover, the viability of intelligent automation depends on reliable connectivity and availability of reliable data and infrastructure, while the battlefield lacks both those conditions. The goal of this study is to deliver medical services and alleviate the vulnerability impacts through more secure design, development, deployment, maintenance, and operations. Additionally, this paper introduces new cybermedicine concepts and architectures that benefit from the various types of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to build Cyber-Medical System that can resist corruption from unauthenticated users/data, and from active malware and physical media attacks. © 2019 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Due to the special security requirements, researching in the high reliability of the power and communication network in drone monitoring system become special important. The reliability of the communication network and power in the drone monitoring system has been studied. In order to assess the reliability of the system power supply in the drone emergency monitoring system, the accelerated life tests under constant stress were presented based on the exponential distribution. Through a comparative analysis of lots of factors, the temperature was chosen as the constant accelerated stress parameter. With regard to the data statistical analysis, the type-I censoring sample method was put forward. The mathematical model of the drone monitoring power supply was established and the average life expectancy curve was obtained under different temperatures through the analysis of experimental data. The results demonstrated that the mathematical model and the average life expectancy curve were fit for the actual very well. With overall consideration of the communication network topology structure and network capacity the improved EED-SDP method was put forward in drone monitoring.

The proposed framework aims at exploiting the extracted social attributes of drones for improving the efficiency of task coordination in a multi-hop delivery way.

However, the classification of multispectral images using supervised machine learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) requires a large amount of training data. This is a common drawback in deep learning. Our method makes use of a semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (GAN), providing a pixel-wise classification for all the acquired multispectral images. It consists of a generator network to provide photo-realistic images as extra training data to a multi-class classifier acting as a discriminator and trained on small amounts of labeled data. The performance of the proposed semi-supervised GAN is evaluated on the weedNet dataset consisting of multispectral crop and weed images collected by a micro aerial vehicle (MAV).

The aerodynamic analysis tool developed by the coupling of the numerical nonlinear lifting-line method to Xfoil is used to obtain lift and drag coefficients of the baseline wing. The outcomes are compared with the results of the solver based on the nonlinear lifting-line theory implemented into XLFR5 and the transition shear stress transport model implemented into ANSYS-Fluent. The agreement between the results at the low and moderate angle of attack values is observed. The sequential quadratic programming algorithm of the MATLAB optimization toolbox is used for the solution of the constrained optimization problems. Three different optimization problems are solved. In the first problem, the maximization of CL3/2/CD is the objective function, while level flight condition at maximum CL3/2/CD is defined as a constraint. The functional constraints related to the wing weight, the wing planform area, and the root bending moment are added to the first optimization problem, and the second optimization problem is constructed. The third optimization problem is obtained by adding the level flight condition and the available power constraints at the maximum speed and the level flight condition at the minimum speed of the baseline unmanned air vehicle to the second problem. It is demonstrated that defining the root bending moment, the wing area, and the available power constraints in the aerodynamic optimization problems leads to more realistic wing planform and airfoil shapes. © 2019 Durmuş Sinan Körpe and Öztürk Özdemir Kanat.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Recent network protocols, such as opportunistic mobile network routing protocols, engaged social network in communication network that can increase the interoperability by using social mobility and opportunistic carry and forward routing algorithms. However, in practical harsh environment such as a battlefield, the uncertainty of social mobility and complexity of vulnerable environment due to unpredictable physical and cyber-attacks from enemy, would seriously affect the effectiveness and practicality of these emerging network protocols. This paper presents a GT-SaRE-MANET (Game Theoretic Situation-aware Robot Enhanced Mobile Ad-hoc Network) routing protocol that adopt the online reinforcement learning technique to supervise the mobility of multi-robots as well as handle the uncertainty and potential physical and cyber attack at tactical edge. Firstly, a set of game theoretic mission oriented metrics has been introduced to describe the interrelation among network quality, multi-robot mobility as well as potential attacking activities. Then, a distributed multi-agent game theoretic reinforcement learning algorithm has been developed. It will not only optimize GT-SaRE-MANET routing protocol and the mobility of multi-robots online, but also effectively avoid the physical and/or cyber-attacks from enemy by using the game theoretic mission oriented metrics.

These measure how much change in forces and moments acting on the vehicle when there is a small change in flight condition parameters such as angle of attack, altitude and speed. Increasing the capability of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method in solving complex unsteady flow around complex geometry, it can be used for determining dynamic stability derivatives of the vehicle which was often conducted in wind tunnel requiring higher cost and quite complex mechanism measurement device. The paper presents the determination of longitudinal static and dynamic stability derivatives of the designed UAV using computational fluid dynamics method and Fourier analysis. For obtaining dynamic stability derivatives, the UAV model have to move in either the single periodic vertical movement or single pitch rotation or in both combination of them with sines or cosines function. The unsteady flow solution around the moving vehicle are then obtained by solving Reynolds averaged navier-stokes equations. The results of unsteady aerodynamic forces and moments of the UAV are then analyzed using Fourier method to yield static and dynamic stability derivatives. Based on the results show that the designed UAV has good longitudinal dynamic stability agreement compared to vortex Lattice method. It fulfills the requirement for the UAV to have longitudinal stability in terms of pitching moment with the rate of angle of attack and pitch rate. © 2019 Journal of Applied Science and Engineering.

Y2H allows identification of protein interaction partners using screening libraries, while RY2H is used to determine residues critical to a given protein-protein interaction by exploiting site-directed mutagenesis. Currently, both these techniques still rely on sequencing of positive clones using conventional Sanger sequencing. For Y2H, a screen can yield several positives; the identification of such clones is further complicated by the fact that sequencing products usually contain vector sequence. For RY2H, obtaining a complete sequence is required to identify the full range of residues involved in protein-protein interactions. However, with Sanger sequencing limited to 500-800 nucleotides, sequencing is usually carried from both ends for clones greater than this length. Analysis of such RY2H data thus requires assembly of sequencing products combined with trimming of vector sequences and of low-quality bases at the beginning and ends of sequencing products. Further, RY2H analysis requires collation of mutations that abrogate a DB/AD interaction. Here, we present 2HybridTools, a Java program with a user-friendly interface that allows addressing all these issues inherent to both Y2H and RY2H. Specifically, for Y2H, 2HybridTools enables automated identification of positive clones, while for RY2H, 2HybridTools provides detailed mutation reports as a basis for further investigation of given protein-protein interactions. © 2019 Cauchy et al.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Motivated by the limitations of prior work, we propose a GPS spoofing detection scheme that requires minimal prior configuration and employs information fusion based on the GPS receiver and inertial measurement unit (IMU). We use a real-time model of tracking and calculating to derive the current location of the drones which are then contrasted with the location information received by the GPS receiver to judge whether the UAV system is under spoofing attack. Experiments show that, while the accuracy meets the requirements of detection, the proposed method can accurately determine whether the system is attacked within 8 s, with a detection rate of 98.6%. Compared with the existing schemes, the performance of real-time detecting is improved in our method while the detection rate is ensured.

These changes contribute substantially to the current mass loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet. In order to constrain models of ice dynamics as well as estimates of mass change, detailed knowledge of geometry and ice flow is needed, in particular on the rapidly changing tongues of ocean-terminating outlet glaciers. In this study, we validate velocity estimates and spatial patterns close to the calving terminus of such an outlet derived from an iterative offset-tracking method based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity data with a collection of three independent reference measurements of glacier flow. These reference datasets are comprised of measurements from differential GPS, a terrestrial radar interferometer (TRI) and repeated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys. Our approach to SAR velocity processing aims at achieving a relatively fine grid spacing and a high temporal resolution in order to best resolve the steep velocity gradients in the terminus area and aims to exploit the 12d repeat interval of the single-satellite Sentinel-1A sensor. Results from images of the medium-sized ocean-terminating outlet glacier Eqip Sermia acquired by Sentinel-1A and RADARSAT-2 exhibit a mean difference of 11.5% when compared to the corresponding GPS measurements. An areal comparison of our SAR velocity fields with independently generated velocity maps from TRI and UAV surveys showed good agreement in magnitude and spatial patterns, with mean differences smaller than 0.7md-1. In comparison with existing operational velocity products, our SAR-derived velocities show an improved spatial velocity pattern near the margins and calving front. There 8% to 30% higher surface ice velocities are produced, which has implications on ice fluxes and on mass budget estimates of similarly sized outlet glaciers. Further, we show that offset tracking from SAR intensity data at relatively low spatio-temporal sampling intervals is a valid method to derive glacier flow fields for fast-flowing glacier termini of outlet glaciers and, given the repeat period of 12d of the Sentinel-1A sensor (6d with Sentinel-1B), has the potential to be applied operationally in a quasi-continuous mode. © 2018 Rendiconti del Seminario Matematico.

Performance of the two vehicles was characterized over a range of speeds and angles of attack. Particular attention was paid to the effect of sharp features along the hulls of the two vehicles and how they affect the observed flow regime. It has been shown that the new design, which uses a bow shape designed to encourage natural laminar flow, benefits from a 10% reduction of parasitic drag and 13% increase in lift-to-drag when the hull surface is smooth. The legacy glider, made up of a faired bow and a cylindrical hull, suffers from laminar separation and up to 100% increase in induced drag if the flow over its bow is prevented from transitioning to a turbulent state before encountering adverse pressure gradient at lower Reynolds numbers. This results in lowering of attainable speed at shallow glide path angles, whereas the associated parasitic drag reduction is demonstrated to increase the maximum velocity of the glider when moving at glide slopes greater than approximately 30°. © 2019 Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers.

Chlorides in a maritime atmosphere, de-icing salts or Sulphur Dioxide in an industrial atmosphere cause high corrosion rates if mild steel is left unprotected. The paper shows the best corrosion protection for a long service life under all these conditions offered by a duplex-coating combining a thermally sprayed zinc-based layer with a fitting top-coat. It introduces the thermal spraying process and its application on bridges, which can be performed in the plant or at the worksite, during erection and for repair work. Thermal Spraying is a well-established process which has been in existence for more than a hundred years. It is used manually, semi-automated and fully automated. Thermal Spraying with zinc and zinc-alloys is a ""cold"" process having no influence on the microstructure of the coated steel. It refers to worldwide standards and norms, which assure the highest quality of material, work and coatings. Worldwide references on steel bridges are presented as well as the latest developments in research. Throughout this abstract, the results of an intensive study over a service life of more than 26 years of duplex systems for Offshore Wind Energy plants is shown.

The study subject is the ore mass of Nikolayevskoye field, characterized by man-induced and tectonic disturbances and high geodynamic activity. The aim of research was practical implementation of methods and instruments of forecast and control over geomechanical state of the burst-hazardous rock mass and safety improvement of mining operations. Exploitation practice of burst-hazardous fields demonstrates that forecast accuracy of hazardous rock pressure demands cutting-edge multi-level systems, where local methods and tools complement regional ones. A regional forecast of rock-burst hazard at Nikolayevskoye field was performed by means of seismoacoustic method using automated control system for rock pressure (ACSRP) «Prognoz-АDS». Local forecast was carried out using «Prognoz-L» device, geophysical (sample disking) method and visual observations of dynamic pressure manifestations in the mining tunnels. Quality assessment of stress-strain and burst state of the rock mass was performed using specialized software «PRESS 3D URAL». Integration of engineering and geomechanical data in the process of conducting research guarantees a relevant assessment of rock-burst hazard in various areas of the field at various stages of its development. Practical verification of the system, where local methods and tools complement regional ones, demonstrated satisfactory results at Nikolayevskoye mining plant, which makes it recommendable for other mining facilities extracting ore at great depths under similar conditions of active geodynamic processes. © 2019, Saint-Petersburg Mining University.

A research spoofing generator will contribute to assess the threat of spoofing attack and help the anti-spoofing research. But the recent commercial of the shelf (COTS) spoofing generator are expensive and the technology implementation is sophisticated and complicated. To address the above problem and promote the GNSS safety-critical applications, a spoofing generator using vector tracking-based software-defined receiver is proposed in this paper. The spoofing generator aims to modify the raw signals by cancelling the actual signal. The connections between the spreading code and carrier and the states of the victim/spoofed receiver are established through vector-tracking. The actual signal can be predicted effectively and the spoofing signal will be generated at the same time. The experiment test results show that the spoofing attack signal can mislead the victim receiver to the designed trajectory effectively. Neither the tracking channels nor the positioning observations has abnormal changes during this processing period. The recent anti-spoofing methods cannot detect this internal spoofing easily. The proposed spoofing generator can cover all open-sky satellites with a good quality of concealment. With the superiority of programmability and diversity, it is believed that the proposed spoofing generator method based on an open source software-defined receiver with vector tracking architecture has a great value for GNSS anti-spoofing researches. © 2019, Institute of Navigation.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In the current implementation of baseline 'snapshot' ARAIM, Carrier Smoothed Code (CSC) measurements at one instant in time are used to provide a navigation solution. Using a time-sequential implementation of ARAIM, i.e., using measurements collected over time, will significantly reduce Protection Levels (PL). It was shown in [3] that snapshot ARAIM cannot provide better performance than LPV-200, which has a 35 m Alert Limit (AL). Exploiting satellite motion will lead to superior positioning performance and significantly tighter PLs relative to baseline snapshot ARAIM, possibly even achieving 10 m ALs to support Category II aircraft approaches. In order to implement this time sequential approach, orbit and clock errors need to be characterized over time. In this paper, we process GPS and Galileo orbit and clock data to evaluate and analyze ranging errors over time. We then determine upper and lower bounds on ranging errors autocorrelation functions. These bounds will be implemented to over-bound time-sequential positioning errors. © 2019, Institute of Navigation.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Notably, TEdeff cancers are characterized by spurious transcription and faulty mRNA processing in a large set of genes, such as interferon/JAK/STAT and TNF/NF-κB pathways, leading to their suppression. The TEdeff subtype of tumors in renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma patients significantly correlate with poor response and outcome in immunotherapy. Given the importance of investigating TEdeff cancers—as it portends a significant roadblock against immunotherapy—the goal of this protocol is to establish an in vitro TEdeff mouse model to study these widespread, non-genetic transcriptional abnormalities in cancers and gain new insights, novel uses for existing drugs, or find new strategies against such cancers. We detail the use of chronic flavopiridol mediated CDK9 inhibition to abrogate phosphorylation of serine 2 residue on the C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II), suppressing the release of RNA Pol II into productive transcription elongation. Given that TEdeff cancers are not classified under any specific somatic mutation, a pharmacological model is advantageous, and best mimics the widespread transcriptional and epigenetic defects observed in them. The use of an optimized sublethal dose of flavopiridol is the only efficacious strategy in creating a generalizable model of non-genetic widespread disruption in transcription elongation and mRNA processing defects, closely mimicking the clinically observed TEdeff characteristics. Therefore, this model of TEdeff can be leveraged to dissect, cell-autonomous factors enabling them in resisting immune-mediated cell attack. © 2019 Journal of Visualized Experiments.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The potential exploitation requires accurate estimation of resources classified as measured resources according to the Australian JORC Code (The Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code). The issue of the accuracy of polymetallic nodule resources estimation was analyzed in the area of the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone in the Pacific administered by the InterOceanMetal Joint Organization (IOM), the contractor of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) since 2001. The area of about 4 200 km2 selected for the analysis is one of the most prospective ones due to the abundance of nodules. The analysis was based on samples collected from the ocean floor using a box corer operated from the research ship. The average distance between sampling sites was about 8 km. The assessment of the accuracy of estimates was made for 15 square calculation blocks with a side of 17 km and an area of 300 km2. They roughly correspond to the areas of annual exploitation, assuming that the average abundance of wet nodules is 10 [kg/m2] and the annual production is 3 million tons. The use of geostatistical block kriging enabled to determine relative standard kriging errors as a measure of the accuracy of estimates of nodule resources. To minimize the risk of mining investment, it was assumed that the nodule resources estimation error in the case of calculation blocks corresponding to the areas of annual exploitation must not exceed 5%. The calculated estimation errors range from 10.6% to 26.6% (with a median equal to 13.1%) and are much higher than the assumed threshold value of 5%. The low accuracy of polymetallic nodule resources estimation is due to the small volume of samples collected by box corer, the large distance between sample collection points, and a relatively high regional (with a coefficient of variation close to 40%), and local variability in the abundance of nodules (discontinuous variation) as indicated by the nugget effect in the geostatistical semivariogram. Subsequent simulations have confirmed that achieving the assumed accuracy would require the collection of a large number of samples from the ocean floor, which is unrealistic given the huge labor intensity and high costs. The only rational way to achieve the assumed accuracy is to combine resource estimates based on box corer sampling method with an additional polymetallic nodule resources estimation based on bottom photographs, taken by the research ship or AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). © SGEM2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

A variety of quadcopter, hexacopter, and octocopter configurations have emerged, yet few publications carefully investigate their performance. This paper contributes results from a series of dynamometer, wind-tunnel, and autonomous flight tests over different propeller configurations, flight speeds, and angles of attack. A modular small hexacopter platform providing propulsion unit redundancy is tested in the standard tractor configuration and a less common pusher configuration. Static thrust as a function of propeller, motor revolutions per minute, and motor current was determined from dynamometer tests. The hexacopter was mounted on a load cell test stand, and data were collected in the University of Michigan’s 5 × 7 ft wind tunnel over different freestream flow speeds, motor thrust percentages, and hexacopter angles of attack. To validate wind-tunnel performance findings, outdoor autonomous flight tests were conducted. Results show the pusher configuration generates approximately 15% more thrust (lift) than do tractor propellers; however, they exhibit a relatively poor lift-to-drag ratio. These results suggests that a pusher configuration hexacopter will have higher efficiency for local-area surveillance applications requiring hover and slow flight, whereas a tractor configuration is more efficient for payload transport applications that require forward flight at appreciable velocities.

Generally speaking, UAVs can be used as new aerial platforms in the cellular network to provide communication services for terrestrial users, or become new aerial users of the cellular network served by the terrestrial base stations. Due to their high altitude, UAVs usually have dominant line-ofsight channels with the ground nodes, which, however, pose new security challenges to future wireless networks with widely deployed UAVs. On one hand, UAV-ground communications are more prone than terrestrial communications to eavesdropping and jamming attacks by malicious nodes on the ground. On the other hand, compared to malicious ground nodes, malicious UAVs can launch more effective eavesdropping and jamming attacks to terrestrial communications.

However, the Caribbean has been threatened by climate change, poverty, pollution, environmental degradation and intense growth of the tourism industry, affecting megafauna species directly and indirectly. Population monitoring plays a critical role in an informed conservation process and helps guide management decisions at several scales. The aim of the present review was to critically examine the methods employed for monitoring marine megafauna in the Caribbean, so as to create a framework for future monitoring efforts. In total, 235 documents describing protocols for the monitoring of sirenians, cetaceans, elasmobranchs, sea turtles and crocodilians in the Caribbean region, were reviewed. The methods included community-based monitoring (interviews, citizen science and fisheries monitoring), aerial surveys (by manned and unmanned aerial vehicles), boat-based surveys (including manta tow, and side-scan sonars), land-based surveys, acoustic monitoring, underwater surveys, baited remote underwater video, mark-recapture, photo-identification and telemetry. Monitoring efforts invested on aquatic megafauna in the Caribbean have been highly different, with some species and/or groups being prioritised over others. The present critical review provides a country-based overview of the current and emerging methods for monitoring marine megafauna and a critical evaluation of their known advantages, disadvantages and biases. © 2019 CSIRO.","Review","Final","Scopus"

Their vulnerabilities have to be studied thoroughly before deploying them in critical systems to avoid irrecoverable loss caused by intentional attacks. Researchers have proposed some methods to craft adversarial examples for studying security risk in object detectors. All these methods require modifying pixels inside target objects. Some modifications are substantial and target objects are significantly distorted. In this paper, an algorithm which derives an adversarial signal placing around the border of target objects to fool objector detectors is proposed. Computationally, the algorithm seeks a border around target objects to mislead Faster R-CNN to produce a very large bounding box and finally decease its confidence to target objects. Using stop sign as a target object, adversarial borders with four different sizes are generated and evaluated on 77 videos, including five in-car videos for digital attacks and 72 videos for physical attacks. The experimental results show that adversarial border can effectively fool Faster R-CNN and YOLOv3 digitally and physically. In addition, the experimental results on YOLOv3 indicate that adversarial border is transferable, which is vital for black-box attack. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

"Integrity monitoring algorithm for GNSS-based cooperative positioning applications","2019","Proceedings of the 32nd International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2019","10.33012/2019.16881","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075267297&doi=10.33012%2f2019.16881&partnerID=40&md5=f85bae0bf525f243bd63ecb0308a8ac2","In recent years, GNSS-based cooperative positioning applications such as multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), and intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) are receiving a great attention. These applications can achieve the information exchange among wireless devices (nodes). As multiple devices equipped with GNSS receivers are feasible to measure the distance and communicate with each other, the positioning performance of a single device can be enhanced greatly by using redundant measurements. Up to now, the focus of GNSS-based cooperative positioning applications is to provide users with high positioning accuracy and availability. Meanwhile, there is also an increasing demand for the integrity of GNSS-based cooperative positioning applications. Compared with conventional GNSS applications, cooperative positioning applications are more vulnerable to the interferences or attacks from the ground. For a cooperative positioning system, the faults occurring at one device could also affect other devices, further resulting in severe positioning errors of each node. Receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM), as a prevalent integrity monitoring method, has shown good performance on detecting and excluding the faults related with satellites. However, some challenges have to be tackled for applying RAIM to GNSS-based cooperative positioning applications including the definition, detection, and exclusion of new fault modes. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the potential faults modes and design an effective RAIM algorithm for cooperative positioning system. In our research, the fault modes related with nodes are firstly introduced. A whole-network extended Kalman filter (WNEKF) is then proposed to integrate the pseudorange measurements of satellites and the ranging measurements between the nodes. Based on solution separation strategy, an integrity monitoring algorithm is developed to detect and exclude the faults. The benefit of our method is that it is conductive to monitor all the faults of the whole network simultaneously. Besides, based on the centralized algorithm, only few master nodes are needed to execute the integrity monitoring algorithm, while the other nodes receive integrity information from the master nodes. © 2019, Institute of Navigation.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This article presents a different approach to PLS and suggests natural and simple ways to achieve security in wireless networks. A practical assumption on the availability of channel state information (CSI) is considered for eavesdroppers (EVs) at the transmitter. Moreover, there is no restriction on EVs' placement, and as such EVs could be in better channel conditions when they are closer to the transmitter. The article describes how the interference channels can be exploited to simultaneously reduce the interference for the users' received signals and amplify the interference at the EV's received signal. It is also shown that when considering communication with energy-constrained nodes, the heterogeneous nature of the transmitted signals is an asset and can be exploited to confuse the eavesdropper. This is because information and energy signals are transmitted over different fractions of a time slot, and the EV can be confused since it does not know the time-fraction when information signal or energy signal is transmitted. Finally, the article also suggests how we can achieve secure information transmission under poor scattering environments, such as unmanned-aerial-vehicle-enabled communications. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Currently, machine learning is increasingly integrated in many applications and thereby, becomes part of everyday life, and automates decisions based on predictions. In certain domains, such as medical diagnosis, security, autonomous driving, and financial trading, wrong predictions can have a significant influence on individuals and groups. While advances in prediction accuracy have been impressive, machine learning systems still can make rather unexpected mistakes on relatively easy examples, and the robustness of algorithms has become a reason for concern before deploying such systems in real-world applications. Recent research has shown that especially deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks that can trigger such wrong predictions. For image analysis tasks, these attacks are in the form of small perturbations that remain (almost) imperceptible to human vision. Such attacks can cause a neural network classifier to completely change its prediction about an image, with the model even reporting a high confidence about the wrong prediction. Of particular interest for an attacker are so-called backdoor attacks, where a specific key is embedded into a data sample, to trigger a pre-defined class prediction. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of poisoning (backdoor) attacks on a number of benchmark datasets from the domain of autonomous driving. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In particular, a lack of resources to deal with critical concerns, such as complaints, poses a threat to customer relations and the public perception of companies. Therefore, it is necessary to prioritize these concerns in order to avoid negative effects. Sentiment analysis, i.e. the automated recognition of the mood in texts, makes such prioritisation possible. The sentiment analysis of German-language emails is still an open research problem. Moreover, there is no evidence of a dominant approach in this context. Therefore two approaches are compared, which are applicable in the context of the problem definition mentioned. The first approach is based on the combination of sentiment lexicons and machine learning methods. This is to be extended by the second approach in such a way that in addition to the lexicons further features are used. These features are to be generated by the use of feature extraction methods. The methods used in both approaches are investigated in a systematic literature search. A Gold Standard corpus is generated as basis for the comparison of these approaches. Systematic experiments are carried out in which the different method combinations for the approaches are examined. The results of the experiments show that the combination of feature extracting methods with Sentiment lexicons and machine learning approaches generates the best classification results.

Exploiting the natural dynamics around the Sun-Earth barycentric Lagrange points, minimal-?V trajectories to flyby asteroids appear which are compatible with current CubeSat propulsive capabilities. Ground operations costs for an interplanetary CubeSat, however, still represent a major challenge towards low-cost missions; hence certain levels of autonomy are desirable. Considering the limited allocation of sensors and actuators in CubeSats, and their limited performance, Monte Carlo simulations are implemented to understand the flyby accuracies that can be achieved through autonomous navigation and guidance. Primary sources of error analyzed in this study include: (1) uncertainties in the departure conditions, (2) errors in the propulsive maneuvers, (3) errors in the observations, and (4) uncertainties in the ephemeris of the target asteroid. An autonomous navigation and guidance strategy is proposed and evaluated, employing observations of the Sun, visible planets and of the target asteroid, and two trajectory correction maneuvers along the trajectory. Flyby accuracies below 100 km are found possible if the mission characteristics are suitable in terms of available ?V, on-board asteroid visibility time, mission duration, and asteroid ephemeris uncertainty before the mission. Ultimately, this study assesses the readiness level of current CubeSat technology to autonomously flyby near-Earth asteroids, with realistic component specifications and modeling of relevant errors and uncertainties. The effect of the different mission factors on the final flyby accuracies is evaluated, and a feasible autonomous navigation and guidance strategy is proposed in the effort to reduce ground operations and overall mission costs.

After the compressed image is trained together with the real image through the discriminator, the quality of the compressed image is constantly improved. This image compression algorithm can fully synthesize the codes of non-major areas such as trees and rivers in the image, and try to retain the codes of important areas such as houses and roads.

However, hybrid UAVs are rarely used because controller design is challenging due to its complex, mixed dynamics. In this paper, we propose a method to automate this design process by training a mode-free, model-agnostic neural network controller for hybrid UAVs. We present a neural network controller design with a novel error convolution input trained by reinforcement learning. Our controller exhibits two key features: First, it does not distinguish among flying modes, and the same controller structure can be used for copters with various dynamics. Second, our controller works for real models without any additional parameter tuning process, closing the gap between virtual simulation and real fabrication.We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controller both in simulation and in our custom-built hybrid UAVs (Figure 1, 8).

UAS surveys can be employed in place of personnel to reduce safety risks, but they generate significant quantities of data that often require manual review. Research and development of automated methods to identify targets of interest in this type of imagery data can provide multiple benefits, including increasing efficiency, decreasing cost, and potentially saving lives through identification of hazards or threats. This paper presents a methodology to efficiently and effectively identify cryptic target objects from UAS imagery. The approach involves flight and processing of airborne imagery in low-light conditions to find low-profile objects (i.e., birds) in beach and desert-like environments. The object classification algorithms combat the low-light conditions and low-profile nature of the objects of interest using cascading models and a tailored deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.

In this paper, we investigate how the UAVs should optimally exploit its mobility via trajectory planning to achieve the fairness of energy consumption with communication, hovering, and motion energy consumption in consideration. Most of the current works only consider motion energy consumption; however, communication and hovering energy consumption cannot be ignored. We first formulate this problem as a min-max tour cover problem that has been proved to be NP-hard. Then, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to minimize the maximum energy consumption of the reconnaissance UAVs by planning the trajectories. Next, to guarantee the fairness of energy consumption under scenarios with strict and firm energy requirements, we propose an approximation algorithm that can achieve an approximation ratio of 2.5. Finally, the extensive simulations are conducted under different settings to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms. The results show that the algorithms can improve the fairness of energy consumption and reduce the maximum energy consumption compared with other algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) has been exploring the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted ultra-wideband (UWB) radar to image and detect obscured explosive hazards. In a stripmap modality, a synthetic aperture radar system travels in a straight line and takes measurements perpendicular to the platform's direction of travel. The large angular diversity provided by the platform motion yields a fine cross-range resolution of the imaged scene. This problem space is being simulated in MATLAB to determine the feasibility of buried target detection and to identify the optimal parameters of operation on a UAV. Parameters such as platform height, incident angle, and bandwidth are investigated. It is shown that performance at different platform heights is determined by the dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on elevation. Furthermore, a minimum platform height is required to meet the minimum requirements of the time-bandwidth product for pulsed waveforms. An optimal transmit angle can be found by maximizing the target-to-clutter ratio (TCR). The target radar cross section (RCS) is taken from finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) models of targets of interest, and the clutter is simulated using the small perturbation method (SPM) for distributed clutter. Finally, the required resolution and bandwidth of the system are presented. © 2109 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

These are often consumed by safety-related applications that e.g. augment situational awareness, issue alerts, recommend courses of action, and even trigger autonomous action. Consequently, the messages need to be both trustworthy and timely. We explore the impact of authenticity and integrity protection mechanisms on message latency using a model based on queuing theory. In conditions of high traffic density such as found in busy city centres, even the latency requirement of 100 ms for first generation V2V applications was found to be challenging. Our main objective was to compare the performance overhead of the standard, PKC-based, message authenticity and integrity protection mechanism with that of an alternative scheme, TESLA, which uses symmetric-key cryptography combine with hash chains. This type of scheme has been dismissed in the past due to supposed high latency, but we found that in high traffic density conditions it outperformed the PKC-based scheme. without invoking congestion management measures. Perhaps the most significant observation from a security perspective is that denial of service attacks appear very easy to carry out and hard to defend against.

"Polar ocean observations: A critical gap in the observing system and its effect on environmental predictions from hours to a season","2019","Frontiers in Marine Science","10.3389/fmars.2019.00429","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069768510&doi=10.3389%2ffmars.2019.00429&partnerID=40&md5=e76dc1cec292b9cd393a0ef53f6da685","There is a growing need for operational oceanographic predictions in both the Arctic and Antarctic polar regions. In the former, this is driven by a declining ice cover accompanied by an increase in maritime traffic and exploitation of marine resources. Oceanographic predictions in the Antarctic are also important, both to support Antarctic operations and also to help elucidate processes governing sea ice and ice shelf stability. However, a significant gap exists in the ocean observing system in polar regions, compared to most areas of the global ocean, hindering the reliability of ocean and sea ice forecasts. This gap can also be seen from the spread in ocean and sea ice reanalyses for polar regions which provide an estimate of their uncertainty. The reduced reliability of polar predictions may affect the quality of various applications including search and rescue, coupling with numerical weather and seasonal predictions, historical reconstructions (reanalysis), aquaculture and environmental management including environmental emergency response. Here, we outline the status of existing near-real time ocean observational efforts in polar regions, discuss gaps, and explore perspectives for the future. Specific recommendations include a renewed call for open access to data, especially real-time data, as a critical capability for improved sea ice and weather forecasting and other environmental prediction needs. Dedicated efforts are also needed to make use of additional observations made as part of the Year of Polar Prediction (YOPP; 2017-19) to inform optimal observing system design. To provide a polar extension to the Argo network, it is recommended that a network of ice-borne sea ice and upper-ocean observing buoys be deployed and supported operationally in ice-covered areas together with autonomous profiling floats and gliders (potentially with ice detection capability) in seasonally-ice covered seas. Finally, additional efforts to better measure and parameterize surface exchanges in polar regions are much needed to improve coupled environmental prediction. © 2019 Smith, Allard, Babin, Bertino, Chevallier, Corlett, Crout, Davidson, Delille, Gille, Hebert, Hyder, Intrieri, Lagunas, Larnicol, Kaminski, Kater, Kauker, Marec, Mazloff, Metzger, Mordy, O'Carroll, Olsen, Phelps, Posey, Prandi, Rehm, Reid, Rigor, Sandven, Swart, Smedstad, Solomon, Storto, Thibaut, Toole, Wood, XIE, Yang and Steering Group.","Review","Final","Scopus"

It was determined that for mathematical modeling of the process of performing a UAV flight task in the conditions of external influences, it is advisable to use a stochastic GERT-network structure. The main features, advantages and disadvantages of mathematical GERT-modeling are considered. This approach allows defining arbitrary functions and probability density distributions of random variables under conditions of uncertainty of these characteristics for the system as a whole. The division of the flight process of the UAV into stages with expert evaluation of the input data at each of the stages made it possible to determine the distribution function of the random variable of the execution time of the flight task of the UAV under external influences. A GERT-network for the performance of a UAV flight mission under external conditions is presented. Taking into account a number of the most important components of the flight task implementation process allowed to bring the prototype of the process in question as close as possible to the actual conditions for the performance of the task set by the UAV and to improve the accuracy of the simulation results. Solved the problem of the mathematical formalization of the Gert network for the performance of a UAV flight mission under external conditions. The results of the formalization of the steel are the expressions for calculating the density and the distribution function of the random variable of the execution time of the UAV task. The analysis and research of the obtained results of modeling. It was revealed that the practical value of the developed model is the ability to predict the process of performing the flight task of the UAV, based on the given characteristics of external influences (intensity, probability, etc.). The results obtained allow for a more in-depth analysis of the individual stages of the flight task, and are designed to help improve the quality and efficiency of UAV control under external conditions. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

An algorithm to categorize moving obstacles based on their positions, velocities, distances, and directions to ascertain their collision threat level and possible replanning decision is introduced. The initial path computation is done using morphological dilation, VD, A-star, and cubic spline algorithms. Instead of considering the entire map of the environment, CGT is used to compute a small rectangular region estimated to enclose a detected collision-threat obstacle and the current position of the robot. The roadmap is computed in the geometrical shape using VD and nodes are added to the initial roadmap nodes to compute a new path for replanning. To avoid increasing time and space requirements, these nodes are discarded before subsequent replanning is done. The results indicate better path replanning performance in complex and dynamic environments in terms of success path computation rate, path cost, time, and the number of replanning computations compared with other five popular related path planning approaches. The proposed method is efficient, and it computes safe and shortest replan path to goal with low computation time requirement. Unnecessary replanning computations are avoided which aid in reducing time and distance to get to the goal. With the performance results, the proposed method is a promising method for achieving safe, less path cost, and time in path replanning computations in complex and dynamic environments. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In 2014, a HAB on Lake Erie containing microcystin (a liver toxin) contaminated the municipal water supply in Toledo, Ohio, providing non-potable water to 400,000 people. Studying HABs is complicated as different cyanobacteria produce a range of toxins that impact human health, such as microcystins, saxitoxin, anatoxin-a, and cylindrospermopsin. HABs may be increasing in prevalence with rising temperatures and higher nutrient runoff. Consequently, new tools and technology are needed to rapidly detect, characterize, and respond to HABs that threaten our water security. A framework is needed to understand cyber threats to new and existing technologies that monitor and forecast our water quality. To properly detect, assess, and mitigate security threats on water infrastructure, it is necessary to envision water security from the perspective of a cyber-physical system (CPS). In doing so, we can evaluate risks and research needs for cyber-attacks on HAB-monitoring networks including data injection attacks, automated system hijacking attacks, node forgery attacks, and attacks on learning algorithms. Herein, we provide perspectives on the research needed to understand both the threats posed by HABs and the coupled cyber threats to water security in the context of HABs. © 2019 Schmale, Ault, Saad, Scott and Westwrick.","Article","Final","Scopus"

These populations are listed under Canada's Species at Risk Act (SARA) as 'endangered' and 'threatened', respectively. Relatively little is known about their habitat use outside of the sheltered waters along the east coast of Vancouver Island, especially during the winter. SARA requires the identification of critical habitat for these populations. High densities of Chinook salmon-their primary prey- are found around Swiftsure Bank, an area identified as potential critical habitat for Southern Residents. However, it is a difficult area to survey for whales using conventional small-boat ap - proaches. Here, we used 2 yr of data collected from an autonomous acoustic recorder deployed at Swiftsure Bank from 2009-2011 to assess the year-round habitat use of this area by Resident killer whales. Overall, Resident killer whales were detected on 244 of 680 monitored days (36%). Southern Residents were heard in all months, with activity peaking during the summer. Northern Residents were also heard throughout the year, but were mostly detected in the spring and fall, which indicates the 2 populations may differ in their strategies for using this common foraging area. High levels of use by both of these populations highlights the importance of Swiftsure Bank to both, supporting the expansion of Resident killer whale critical habitat to include this site. © The authors 2019.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In such new areas of URLLC and m-MTC, mobile operators need to explore new use cases and/or applications together with vertical industries, the industries which are potential users of 5G, in order to fully exploit the new 5G capabilities. Intelligent Transport System (ITS), including automated driving, is one of the most promising application areas of 5G since it requires both ultra-reliable and low-latency communications. We are actively working on the research and development of truck platooning as a new 5G application. We have developed a field trial system for vehicular-to-network (V2N) communications using 5G prototype equipment and actual large-size trucks in order to assess 5G capabilities, including ultra-low-latency, in automotive test courses in the field. This paper discusses the fundamental performance evaluation required for vehicular communications between platooning trucks, such as low-latency message communication for vehicle control and low-latency video monitoring of following platooning truck vehicles. The paper also addresses the field evaluation results of 5G V2N communications in a rural area. It clarifies the fundamental radio propagation issues at the leading and the following vehicles in truck platooning for V2N communications, and discusses the impact of the radio propagation over a road to the over-the-air transmission performance of 5G V2N communications.

However, CNNs do not explicitly retain the relative position of objects in an image and, thus, the effectiveness of the obtained features is limited in the framework of the complex object detection problems. To address this problem, in this paper we introduce Capsule Networks (CapsNets) for object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-acquired images. Unlike CNNs, CapsNets extract and exploit the information content about objects' relative position across several layers, which enables parsing crowded scenes with overlapping objects. Experimental results obtained on two datasets for car and solar panel detection problems show that CapsNets provide similar object detection accuracies when compared to state-of-the-art deep models with significantly reduced computational time. This is due to the fact that CapsNets emphasize dynamic routine instead of the depth. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The principal treatment is surgical removal where a complete tumor resection is crucial to reduce the recurrence and mortality rate. Intraoperative tumor imaging enables surgeons to objectively visualize the malignant lesion to maximize the tumor removal with healthy safe margins. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging imaging modality for cancer detection, which can augment surgical tumor inspection, currently limited to subjective visual inspection. In this paper, we aim to investigate HSI for automated cancer detection during image-guided surgery, because it can provide quantitative information about light interaction with biological tissues and exploit the potential for malignant tissue discrimination. The proposed solution forms a novel framework for automated tongue-cancer detection, explicitly exploiting HSI, which particularly uses the spectral variations in specific bands describing the cancerous tissue properties. The method follows a machine-learning based classification, employing linear support vector machine (SVM), and offers a superior sensitivity and a significant decrease in computation time. The model evaluation is on 7 ex-vivo specimens of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, with known histology. The HSI combined with the proposed classification reaches a sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 68% and area under the curve (AUC) of 92%. This feasibility study paves the way for introducing HSI as a non-invasive imaging aid for cancer detection and increase of the effectiveness of surgical oncology. © 2019 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

UAVs can be exploited to efficiently accomplish complex missions when cooperatively organized as an ad hoc network, thus creating the well-known flying ad hoc networks (FANETs). The establishment of such networks is not feasible without deploying an efficient networking model allowing a reliable exchange of information between UAVs. FANET inherits common features and characteristics from mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and their sub-classes, such as vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Unfortunately, UAVs are often deployed in the sky adopting a mobility model dictated by the nature of missions that they are expected to handle, and therefore, differentiate themselves from any traditional networks. Moreover, several flying constraints and the highly dynamic topology of FANETs make the design of routing protocols a complicated task. In this paper, a comprehensive survey is presented covering the architecture, the constraints, the mobility models, the routing techniques, and the simulation tools dedicated to FANETs. A classification, descriptions, and comparative studies of an important number of existing routing protocols dedicated to FANETs are detailed. Furthermore, the paper depicts future challenge perspectives, helping scientific researchers to discover some themes that have been addressed only ostensibly in the literature and need more investigation. The novelty of this survey is its uniqueness to provide a complete analysis of the major FANET routing protocols and to critically compare them according to different constraints based on crucial parameters, thus better presenting the state of the art of this specific area of research. © 2019 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

First, the time-coordinated control problem for a single UAV is formulated, which is the foundation of solving the problem of a single UAV arriving at the desired attack position relative to ground-moving target at a specific terminal time. Then, relative motion between each UAV and ground-moving target is considered as a finite-time time-varying tracking system problem, and the difference between expected output and system output is defined as tracking error vector. The control law is obtained by linear quadratic optimal control theory to minimize the energy cost in the whole process and the tracking error at the terminal time. Besides, time-coordinated function, which is critical to coordinate terminal time among all UAVs in the UAV swarm, is proposed to model time-coordinated strategies. Finally, numerical simulations show that the proposed control law can steer UAV swarm to arrive at the desired attack positions and achieve the time-coordinated strategies effectively. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To explorehownavigational Lock and Dams (LDs) on the Mississippi River could be used to deter the upstream migration of invasive fish species, computer modelling that combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and agent-based (AB) fish passage model (CFD-AB model) could be used to hypothetically quantify the passage of bigheaded carp (Hypophthalmichthys spp.) through LDs. Agent-based fish (AB-fish) are always located on a node of the CFD mesh and move by selecting the neighboring node that minimizes fatigue. A possible limitation of this approach is that the AB-fish movement exhibits a dependence upon the CFD mesh. The proposed modified approach allows the AB-fish to occupy any point in the computational domain and to continually (within the size of the time step) update their minimum fatigue path.

In this paper, we introduce delayed-action games (DAGs) formalism that simulates hidden-information games (HIGs) as SMGs, where hidden information is captured by delaying a player’s actions. The elimination of private variables enables the usage of SMG off-the-shelf model checkers to implement HIGs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a DAG can be decomposed into subgames that can be independently explored, utilizing parallel computation to reduce the model checking time, while alleviating the state space explosion problem that SMGs are notorious for. In addition, we propose a DAG-based framework for strategy synthesis and analysis. Finally, we demonstrate applicability of the DAG-based synthesis framework on a case study of a human-on-the-loop unmanned-aerial vehicle system under stealthy attacks, where the proposed framework is used to formally model, analyze and synthesize security-aware strategies for the system. © The Author(s). 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

At present, the main positioning method for UAVs is the use of GPS. However, GPS positioning may be affected by stronger electromagnetic signals from spoofing attacks. In this study, a radar-assisted positioning method based on 5G millimeter waves is proposed. In 5G end-to-end network slices, the rotors of UAVs can be detected and identified by deploying 5G millimeter wave radar. High-resolution range profile (HRRP) is used to obtain the UAV location in the detection zone. Micro-Doppler characteristics are used to identify the UAVs and the cepstrum method is used to extract the number and speed information of the UAV rotor. The sinusoidal frequency modulation (SFM) parameter optimization method is used to separate multiple UAVs. The proposed method provides information on the number of UAVs, the position of the UAV, the number of rotors, and the rotation speed of each rotor. The simulation results show that the proposed radar detection method is well suited for UAV detection and identification and provides a valid GPS-independent method for UAV tracking. © 2019 Jingcheng Zhao et al.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, with a large distance to the search areas, the sea transition (from one point to the other) of the underwater vehicles requires high energy costs. This leads to the necessity to use heavy-duty underwater vehicles, which determines the high cost of the search operation. The transport of underwater vehicles is proposed to be carried out with an unmanned surface vessel, equipped with actuators for the automatic release of a group of vehicles under water and receiving on board after the end of the underwater mission. The maritime unmanned complex consisting of an unmanned surface vessel and a group of autonomous underwater vehicles on its board forms a new type of marine robotics, the complete automation of which is an actual scientific and technical task. For its implementation, the underlying (basic) automation technology of the marine search underwater mission has been developed as the theoretical basis for the development of the generalized structure of the complex automatic control system. Ten implementation stages of the underlying technology are formulated and the analysis of their automation features with the use of modern methods in the field of marine robotics is performed. Automation of the underlying technology stages involves the transfer of the vessel to a given water area, the automatic release (launch) of the group of underwater vehicles and their coordinated motion to the search area, the search operations and the return to the unmanned surface vessel, as well as the recovery of the vessel to the base. The generalized requirements for automatic control systems constituting the maritime unmanned complex at each stage of its functioning are provided. The spiral trajectory of waiting for the motion of the underwater vehicles at the group formation stages, for the search operation execution and after its completion, is proposed. For the spatial motion of the autonomous underwater vehicle as an agent of the group, the automatic control system was improved by introducing the blocks of the “Navigation Situation Model” and the “Navigation Threat Identifier, which make it impossible for emergency collision with the neighboring underwater vehicles of the group and disintegrate the group due to the data communication loss between them. © The Author(s) 2019.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Typically, these techniques either (a) optimize communication routes based on topology-independent constraint systems that encode the inclusion of each network component in the route of a message or (b) depend on a time- and memory-expensive enumeration of all possible transmission routes to identify the optimal route. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which combines the advantages of these two strategies to enable an efficient exploration of the routing search space: First, the given network is preprocessed to identify so-called proxy areas in which each pair of nodes can be connected by exactly one route. Contrary to network areas with a variety of different routing possibilities, proxy areas do not offer any room for optimization. We propose two approaches-both integrable into existing constraint systems-which exploit the knowledge gathered on proxy areas to improve the exploration efficiency during the routing optimization process. Experimental results for two mainstream topologies of automotive networks give evidence that, compared to state-of-the-art routing optimization approaches, the proposed approaches (a) offer an exploration speedup of up to ×185, (b) deliver network designs of equal or higher quality, and (c) enable an automated design of significantly larger automotive systems. © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Key to the ‘new’ Cloud is the advent of so-called function-as-a-service and edge, to which these issues of performance and lessons learned from energy efficiency can be applied. Important to this is to establish what we mean by edge as distinct from other things as may be similarly referred to.

As the UAV aerial video has rapid changes in scale and perspective, few pixels in the target region, and multiple similar disruptors, and the main tracking methods in this research field generally have relatively low tracking performance and timeliness, we propose a remote sensing target tracking method for the UAV aerial video based on a saliency enhanced multi-domain convolutional neural network (SEMD). First, in the pre-training stage, we combine the least squares generative adversarial networks (LSGANs) with a multi-orientation Gaussian Pyramid to augment typical easily confused negative samples for enhancing the capacity to distinguish between targets and the background. Then, a saliency module was integrated into our tracking network architecture to boost the saliency of the feature map, which can improve the representation power of a rapid dynamic change target. Finally, in the stage for generating tracking samples, we implemented a local weight allocation model to screen for hard negative samples. This approach can not only improve the stability in tracking but also boost efficiency. The comprehensive evaluations of public and homemade hard datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve high accuracy and efficiency results compared with state-of-the-art methods. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To develop a UAV capable of carrying out the mission of mapping the coastal estate's area, in this research is done wing design UAV which is named serindit V-1. The design process begins with the design concept, then proceed with a preliminary design that aims to determine the dimensions and initial configuration of the wing UAV serindit V-1. Furthermore, the wing UAV serindit V-1 is simulated on XFLR5 software using Clark's airfoil, GOE 611 and S7055. Simulations were performed to see the characteristics of aerodynamic at takeoff speed (12 m / s), cruising speed (20 m / s) and maximum speed (30 m / s). Simulation result at the take-off speed and cruising speed show the lift coefficients produced by the three airfoils meet the requirements. Then, the highest value of the lift coefficient ratio to the air drag coefficient at cruising speed, produced by airfoil S7055 at a 3-degree angle of attack. Furthermore, the graph of the pitching moment coefficient on all angles of attack produced by the three airfoils shows a negative gradient.

Autonomous vehicles are expected to take over tasks which are dull, dirty and dangerous for humans (3Ds of robotization). However, augmented autonomy increases reliance on the robustness of the system. Autonomous vehicle systems are heavily focused on data acquisition in order to perceive the driving environment accurately. In the future, a typical autonomous vehicle data ecosystem will include data from internal sensors, infrastructure, communication with nearby vehicles, and other sources. Physical faults, malicious attacks or a misbehaving vehicle can result in the incorrect perception of the environment, which can in turn lead to task failure or accidents. Anomaly detection is hence expected to play a critical role improving the security and efficiency of autonomous and connected vehicles. Anomaly detection can be defined as a way of identifying unusual or unexpected events and/or measurements. In this paper, we focus on the specific case of malicious attack/hijacking of the system which results in unpredictable evolution of the autonomous vehicle. We use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for anomaly/fault detection. It is, first, trained on non-abnormal data to understand the system's baseline performance and behaviour, monitored through three vehicle control parameters namely velocity, acceleration and jerk. Then, the model is used to predict over a number of future time steps and an alarm is raised as soon as the observed behaviour of the autonomous car significantly deviates from the prediction. The relevance of this approach is supported by numerical experiments based on data produced by an autonomous car simulator, capable of generating attacks on the system. © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this line, the combination of operational modes (polarity and/or metal transfer mode) within a process has gained attention, since it expands the adjustability of the arc energy. By combining this feature with arc motion,the arc energy delivered to the workpiece can be optimally distributed. Therefore, this work exploits the synchronization between arc magnetic oscillation and gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process to control weld bead formation. A system was devised to control the magnetic oscillation and a welding power source synchronously. Characterization of the synchronized magnetic oscillation was carried out based on high-speed filming and electrical data. The welding process was then synchronized with the magnetic oscillation varying the level of welding current according to the arc time-position, being the effect on weld bead width considered for analysis. Welding with outoscillation and with unsynchronized magnetic oscillation were taken as references. The synchronized magnetic oscillation made possible to achieve larger weld bead width on the side with higher current level and longer lateral stop time and vice versa.

While ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm has attracted a great deal of attention due to the fact that ants can work cooperatively to find an optimal path. However, ACO converges slowly in finding an optimal path, particularly for the case when the problem domain is large.

The emergence of the immense economic potential necessitates a robust authentication mechanism that needs to be lightweight and suitable for real-time applications. Moreover, the physical integrity of these devices cannot be assumed as these are designed to be deployed in an unattended environment with minimum human supervision. A user authentication mechanism for the IoT, in addition to guaranteeing user anonymity and un-traceability functionality requirements, must also be resistant to device physical capture and related misuses.

It is shown that the proposed scheme has the ability to resist various well-known attacks that are crucial for securing the IoT environment. Through a detailed comparative study, we show that the proposed scheme outperforms other existing related schemes in terms of computation and communication costs, and also security functionality features.

Experimental validation is performed through indoor free-flight pitch step responses. On average, the simulated root mean square pitch tracking error is found to be within 31% of the experiment. The usefulness of the whole system to determine station-keeping performance is assessed by free-flight station-keeping experiments in a wind tunnel environment. The tracking error along all three axes is found to increase with increasing mean wind speed. The simulated standard deviation of errors along the wind direction is on average within 7% of the experiment, whereas those of the errors along axes perpendicular to the wind direction are found to be within 56%.

This BKDEF is focused on guiding staff training courses for enhancing the ability to allocate the ""large but limited"" budget for single, high-cost product design. However, except for its initial application to support the budget planning for the next generation fighter design, the framework's effectiveness is still awaiting further scrutiny. This study fills the gap by providing the ""second application"" of BKDEF, which is to support another similar decision for designing the medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial system (MALE UAS). This paper verified the effectiveness of the framework through an empirical application and obtained the knowledge required to allocate a budget for MALE UAS design following the group-opinion basis. In addition, the original analytical style for the last ""decision analysis"" phase of BKDEF, which included pure quantitative analytical items in order to understand the similarities and diversities in the individual opinions, was replaced by a comparative study to discover the homogeneity and heterogeneity between the two budgeting decisions in a larger scope. As a consequence, the two criteria sets did not overlap despite both decisions being related to military aircraft design. The absolute weights for the MALE UAS design criteria were more balanced than those for the air-superior fighter design, even if the size of the criteria set was larger.

This evaluation is subject to significant uncertainties (commodity prices, production rates,…), adding complexity to the economic models. On the other hand, decisions must be taken in shortest time to catch opportunities. This paper proposes a new economic model for investment decisions, with the double objective of accelerating the evaluation phase and providing better information to make decisions. This model, supported by a collaborative interface, consolidates information coming from all departments (production, commercial, engineering, finance, portfolio). Next, specifics Oil and Gas fiscal models (PSA, royalties, provisions) are applied and results are consolidated at asset affiliate and portfolio levels. Then, tens of economic criteria (NPV, technical costs, production ratios, Break-even Price, …) are calculated and graphically represented in a dashboard directly aimed at the decision makers. Once having such a consolidated model, any investment strategy can be evaluated in a short time. Multi-level sensitivity analyses are available to give the most complete vision of possible future outcomes. The first level of sensitivity is given by specific input parameters that are managed at a global level (WACC, commodities price, inflation, exchange rate). As such, any variation in a global input will be automatically reported on the overall portfolio. The second level of sensitivity is provided by the Monte Carlo simulation, calculated from the model uncertainties, either threats or opportunities. Each uncertainty is characterized by a probability and an impact variable applied on any model parameter, such as global inputs, production profiles and costs.. The ultimate level of sensitivity is the definition of the portfolio Efficient Frontier. Considering multiple investments strategies, the probabilistic approach is adding the risk dimension through the Value at Risk (VaR). Over risk-exposed strategies can be excluded, and optimal strategies are unequivocally identified on the Efficient Frontier. The innovative contribution of the solution is the ability to perform typical and what-if evaluations of assets or portfolio, as well as addressing any uncertainty impacting cash flows. The oil and gas industry is producing risk-based information at many stages (production forecast, schedule and cost risk assessments), however such information is barely consolidated for investment decisions. An integrated and automated asset/portfolio economic model raises valuable typical and risk-based indicators to the highest levels of management. © 2019 Offshore Mediterranean Conference (OMC).

The phenological events occur sequentially-leaf fall, leaf flushing, flowering and fruiting from April to November. It is hermaphroditic, protandrous, self-compatible, facultative xenogamous, and melittophilous involving worker honey bees, small male and female carpenter bees and male and female cuckoo bees. Of these, worker honey bees and female carpenter bees forage for both pollen and nectar while male carpenter bees and both sexes of cuckoo bees forage exclusively for nectar. Cuckoo bees are very important for cross-pollination because they are swift fliers and visit many flowers from different plants in the shortest time. Carpenter bees and honey bees are largely important for self-pollination as they are not fast fliers and tend to spend more time at each flower for forage collection. The flowers have a specialized pollination mechanism to resort to autonomous autogamy if not pollinated but this mode of pollination is subject to the availability of pollen in its own anthers. Fruit is a 1-seeded follicle produced from a single carpel of the flower. It is indehiscent and floats in tidal water when detached from the plant. When settled in muddy substratum, it breaks open to expose the seed which germinates and produces a new plant in quick succession. The study reports that the plant is highly threatened due to different human economic activities taking place in the area and hence immediate in situ conservation measures are required for its protection and propagation. © Raju 2019.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In addition, there is a design opportunity to exploit existing wall surfaces as ‘analogue’ media screens by using the vertical farm and garden as a medium of representation. In this paper we explore the opportunity for new design possibilities to achieve a hybrid architectural wall system as a reciprocal retrofit for existing building surfaces, integrating a vertical micro-farm and media screen. This architectural opportunity is explored through agile methods and the early design stages of a hybrid green media wall, PixelGreen. PixelGreen will be retrofitted to an existing wall of a high-rise building to convey mediated, graphical, artistic content and provide edible plant micro-farming simultaneously. The physical proof of concept is given through a modular mock-up with a programmed UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) serving as the ‘agent’ for constant updating of mediated content, maintenance and a regular farming cycle. The outcome of this approach provides preliminary insight into how to feasibly implement a hybrid green media wall with autonomous robotics and computation technology. © 2019 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The use of UAV in the daily tasks of industry, commerce or as entertainment for children and adults becomes more recurrent. Each of the UAVs has a specific task, depending on the technologies that are provided, in addition to their basic functions with which they were manufactured. However, in most cases the security of these UAVs is not usually taken into account since some of them are inexpensive and do not have a robust security system that protects the data they send or receive for their operation, that can cause its communication system or the operating system that controls its basic functions of flight, landing, among others, to be compromised. These computer attacks could cause physical or moral harm to people around the same operator of the UAV because they could steal information related to the locations they have visited, or intercept images or videos taken by the UAV. This paper shows the exploitation of GPS vulnerability in the commercial drone of the company 3D Robotics, this vulnerability can cause a malicious user to have control of their autonomy, and carry out illicit activities, such as overflying in spaces not allowed as an airport and private areas. The exploitation of this vulnerability is important to make known that the UAVs should have a more robust security system and also give importance to the security of GPS since the only one that has security is the military GPS. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Effective measures to mitigate and prevent marine plastic pollution require a thorough understanding of its origin and eventual fate. Several models have estimated that land-based sources are the main source of marine plastic pollution, although field data to substantiate these estimates remain limited. Current methodologies to measure riverine plastic transport require the availability of infrastructure and accessible riverbanks, but, to obtain measurements on a higher spatial and temporal scale, new monitoring methods are required. This paper presents a new methodology for quantifying riverine plastic debris using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), including a first application on Klang River, Malaysia. Additional plastic measurements were done in parallel with the UAV-based approach to make comparisons between the two methods. The spatiotemporal distribution of the plastics obtained with both methods show similar patterns and variations. With this, we show that UAV-based monitoring methods are a promising alternative for currently available approaches for monitoring riverine plastic transport, especially in remote and inaccessible areas. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

While the node authentication allows two sensing devices to authenticate each other using their own pre-loaded secret credentials in memory, the key agreement phase permits to establish a secret key between them if the mutual authentication is successful. In this paper, we propose a new certificate-based 'lightweight access control and key agreement protocol in the IoT environment, called LACKA-IoT,' that utilizes the elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) along with the 'collision-resistant one-way cryptographic hash function.' Through a detailed security analysis using the formal security under the 'Real-Or-Random (ROR) model,' informal (non-mathematical) security analysis, and formal security verification using the broadly used 'Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA)' tool, we show that the LACKA-IoT can protect various known attacks that are needed for a secure device access control mechanism in the IoT. Furthermore, through a comparative study of the LACKA-IoT and other relevant schemes, we show that there is a better tradeoff among the security and functionality features and communication and computational costs of the LACKA-IoT as compared to other schemes.

It is the key component to intelligent agents, such as self-driving vehicles, medical monitoring devices and robotics. In this work, we consider generating unseen future frames from previous observations, which is notoriously hard due to the uncertainty in frame dynamics. While recent works based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) made remarkable progress, there is still an obstacle for making accurate and realistic predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN based on inter-frame difference to circumvent the difficulties. More specifically, our model is a multi-stage generative network, which is named the Difference Guided Generative Adversarial Network (DGGAN). The DGGAN learns to explicitly enforce future-frame predictions that is guided by synthetic inter-frame difference. Given a sequence of frames, DGGAN first uses dual paths to generate meta information. One path, called Coarse Frame Generator, predicts the coarse details about future frames, and the other path, called Difference Guide Generator, generates the difference image which include complementary fine details. Then our coarse details will then be refined via guidance of difference image under the support of GANs.

Arrhythmia is a disturbance of the heartbeat that can potentially be lethal. Arrhythmia can be detected by identifying an individual abnormal heartbeat, which can occur in isolation or sequentially. Heartbeats can be classified into five types: non-ectopic (N), supra ventricular ectopic (S), ventricular ectopic (V), fusion (F) and unknown beats (Q). Automated classification of the incidence and pattern of abnormal heartbeats enables arrhythmia detection, triage and life-threatening arrhythmia. Therefore, it is vital to develop a tool for the classification of these classes. ECG signals are contaminated by noise rendering difficulty and challenging to discriminate between different types of heartbeats. In this work, we used noisy as well as denoised (clean) ECG signals to classify heartbeats. Using stop-band energy (SBE) minimized dyadic orthogonal filter bank, wavelet decomposition of the ECG signals was performed. After this, fuzzy entropy, Renyi entropy and fractal dimension features were extracted for easier and accurate classification into the five classes. These features were then fed to classifiers, achieving maximum accuracy (MAAC) of 98%, maximum sensitivity (MASE) of 85.33% and maximum specificity (MASP) of 98.22% for noisy data, and MAAC of 98.1%, MASE of 85.63% and MASP of 98.27% for clean data, with KNN classifier.

Such intimacy fnds its sustenance in the knowledge that results from the afections incubated toward the territory, as revealed by beekeeping. The case of bees is of particular interest because of the stimulus they represent both for the development of personal reforestation initiatives and for the possibility they ofer to reinvent small-scale ways of life. It is in their relationship with them that both the traditional patterns of interspecies linkage and the threats posed by market expansion come into play, particularly about the linkage of the pollinating activity of the bee ofered as a service to the company. The knowledge and afects generated by beekeeping contradict the scientifc knowledge conveyed to communities by the institutions of development. The meeting of both forms of knowledge raises contradictions and misunderstandings that suggest the convenience of constituting local practices in a model of substantive environmental citizenship. The symbiotic modes prevalent in the community ensure autonomous ways of inhabiting the territories, forms that are stressed when production intensifes in the interests of business opportunities.

This is a step toward making informed/explainable decisions in the domain of time series, powered by deep learning. There have been numerous efforts to increase the interpretability of image-centric deep neural network models, where the learned features are more intuitive to visualize. Visualization in the domain of time series is significantly challenging, as there is no direct interpretation of the filters and inputs compared with the imaging modality. In addition, a little or no concentration has been devoted to the development of such tools in the domain of time series in the past. TSViz provides possibilities to explore and analyze the network from different dimensions at different levels of abstraction, which includes the identification of the parts of the input that were responsible for a particular prediction (including per filter saliency), importance of the different filters present in the network, notion of diversity present in the network through filter clustering, understanding of the main sources of variation learned by the network through inverse optimization, and analysis of the network's robustness against adversarial noise. As a sanity check for the computed influence values, we demonstrate our results on pruning of neural networks based on the computed influence information. These representations allow the user to better understand the network so that the acceptability of these deep models for time-series analysis can be enhanced. This is extremely important in domains, such as finance, industry 4.0, self-driving cars, health care, and counter-terrorism, where reasons for reaching a particular prediction are equally important as the prediction itself. We assess the proposed framework for interpretability with a set of desirable properties essential for any method in this direction. © 2019 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To describe the attitude of the AUV without singularities, quaternions are used to describe its translational and rotational motion. A finite-time convergent extended state observer (FTCESO) in conjunction with the sliding mode control (SMC) approach is exploited to design the tracking controller for the closed-loop system with the finite-time convergence. Meanwhile, in order to release the burden of the observer, the anti-windup compensator is utilized to handle the nonlinearity of input saturation. A switch function is considered to make a switch between the robust controller and the constant-rate reaching law. Subsequently, with consideration of the inherent singularity problem of actuator dynamics, the constrained steering logic is implemented to avoid this issue without introducing other torque errors in theory. Finite-time stability of the attitude tracking system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov-based approach. Finally, the simulation results validate the attitude tracking performance of the CMG-based AUV with the proposed control strategy, when it is subject to the stated nonlinear uncertainties. © 2019 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Effective and robust segmentation in outdoor scene is prerequisite for safe autonomous navigation of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, our aim is to find the best exploitation of different imaging modalities for road scene segmentation, as opposed to using a single RGB modality. We explore deep learning-based early and later fusion pattern for semantic segmentation, and propose a new multi-level feature fusion network. Given a pair of aligned multimodal images, the network can achieve faster convergence and incorporate more contextual information. In particular, we introduce the first-of-its-kind dataset, which contains aligned raw RGB images and polarimetric images, followed by manually labeled ground truth. The use of polarization cameras is a sensory augmentation that can significantly enhance the capabilities of image understanding, for the detection of highly reflective areas such as glasses and water. Experimental results suggest that our proposed multimodal fusion network outperforms unimodal networks and two typical fusion architectures.

However, open channels can be vulnerable to various attacks by a malicious adversary. Therefore, secure mutual authentication for V2G has become essential, and numerous related protocols have been proposed. In 2018, Shen et al. proposed a privacy-preserving and lightweight key agreement protocol for V2G in SIoT to ensure security. However, we demonstrate that their protocol does not withstand impersonation, privileged-insider, and offline password guessing attacks, and it does not also guarantee secure mutual authentication, session key security, and perfect forward secrecy. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic privacy-preserving and lightweight key agreement protocol for V2G in SIoT to resolve the security weaknesses of Shen et al.'s protocol. The proposed protocol resists several attacks including impersonation, offline password guessing, man-in-the-middle, replay, and trace attacks, ensures anonymity, perfect forward secrecy, session key security, and secure mutual authentication. We evaluate the security of the proposed protocol using formal security analysis under the broadly-accepted real-or-random (ROR) model, secure mutual authentication proof using the widely-accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, informal (non-mathematical) security analysis, and also the formal security verification using the broadly-accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool. We then compare computation costs, and security and functionality features of the proposed protocol with related protocols.

In particular, surveying traffic sign damage and conditions has become essential for determining and prioritizing necessary repair/replacement. Under the research project sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences NCHRP-IDEA program, a conventional sign detection algorithm based on color, shape, and texture has been developed to process the images of signs. The developed algorithm has been enhanced by digital image processing and deep-learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN), and region-based convolutional neural networks (RCNN). In this paper, a method is designed to process the images obtained using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), employing a model UAV, to further develop of our current research. The preliminary test shows that it is promising to use a UAV and machine learning to develop an expedited infrastructure condition evaluation following natural disasters because of its automatic and non-contact nature. The preliminary outcomes show the detection rates have satisfying FN rates and very low FP rates. Besides, the designed algorithm and data-gathering method provides a real-time and on-site computation capability that reduces the quantity of data to be stored by filtering out unnecessary data instantly. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

PCG signals provide useful information and can help in the early detection and diagnosis of heart diseases. Many studies have attempted to discover automated tools that analyse heart sounds by applying machine learning algorithms. Although tremendous efforts have been made in this area, no successful framework currently exists to detect pathology in signals because of issues with background noise or poor quality. One part of the evolution of machine learning is the development of deep learning networks, which are designed to exploit the compositional structure of data. This paper investigates the performance of a convolutional neural network called AlexNet, focusing on two approaches for distinguishing abnormality in PCG signals with data collected from the 2016 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge dataset. This dataset contains heart sound recordings collected from clinical and non-clinical environments.

Traditional methods for post-harvest survey involving manual assessment of debris on the ground over small sample plots are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and do not scale well to heterogeneous landscapes. In this paper, we propose and evaluate new automated methods for the collection and interpretation of high-resolution, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-borne imagery over post-harvested forests for estimating quantities of fine and coarse woody debris. Using high-resolution, geo-registered color mosaics generated from UAV-borne images, we develop manual and automated processing methods for detecting, segmenting and counting both fine and coarse woody debris, including tree stumps, exploiting state-of-the-art machine learning and image processing techniques. Results are presented using imagery over a post-harvested compartment in a Pinus radiata plantation and demonstrate the capacity for both manual image annotations and automated image processing to accurately detect and quantify coarse woody debris and stumps left over after harvest, providing a cost-effective and scalable survey method for forest managers. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, even the emerging fifth-generation (5G) networks may face difficulty in supporting the increased traffic demand with a rigid, fixed infrastructure without substantial over-provisioning. This is particularly true for spontaneous large-scale events that require service providers to augment the capacity of their networks quickly. Today, the use of aerial devices equipped with high-rate radio access capabilities has the potential to offer the much needed 'on-demand' capacity boost. Conversely, it also threatens to rattle the long-standing business strategies of wireless operators, especially as the 'gold rush' for cheaper millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum lowers the market entry barriers. However, the intricate structure of this new market presently remains a mystery. This paper sheds light on competition and cooperation behavior of dissimilar aerial mmWave access suppliers, concurrently employing licensed and license-exempt frequency bands, by modeling a vertically differentiated market where customers have varying preferences in price and quality. To understand viable service provider strategies, we begin by constructing the Nash equilibrium for the initial market competition by employing the Bertrand and Cournot games. We then conduct a unique assessment of short-term market dynamics, where licensed-band service providers may cooperate to improve their competitive positions against the unlicensed-band counterparts intruding on the market. Our analysis studies the effects of various market interactions, price-driven demand evolution, and dynamic profit balance in this novel type of ecosystem. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The increased interconnectedness among devices, people, networks, and systems, however, introduces a level of complexity surpassing the experience accumulated so far. While the security of communications, network and information systems can be considered a well-established discipline, the study of security of cyber-physical systems is fairly recent. Furthermore, the dependencies of live organisms, including humans, with integrated sensors and electronics, of perceptions and cognition, and variety of drones on influences from cyberspace have been subject of only few, mostly incidental studies. The interdependencies among cyber, physical, biological systems, and humans in situation assessment and decision-making roles create new potential vectors of attack by malicious actors. If exploited, they will lead to cross impact among domains that are usually studied separately. Authors from three Bulgarian institutions, combining research and policy-making experience, embarked on the task to elaborate a comprehensive cybersecurity research agenda. This paper presents their concept for an integrative approach to the exploration of ‘systems of systems.’ The study is structured along five domains: communications and information systems and networks; cyber-physical system; bio-integrated systems; cognitive processes, i.e. the processes of shaping perceptions, assessing a certain situation and options and making decisions; and drones, remotely controlled or autonomous, the latter case being particularly reliant on advances in artificial intelligence. This paper outlines the problem of vulnerability of each of the five domains to influences from cyber space. Then it presents some advances in cross-domain understanding of vulnerabilities, supported by examples of cybersecurity studies, and provides the outlines of a corresponding, interdisciplinary research agenda, built around the concept of systems of systems. The authors conclude by predicting that the field of cybersecurity will be subject to considerable growth in coming years, requiring multi-and inter-disciplinary competencies and scientific support. © 2019, Curran Associates Inc.

The US Department of Defense developed a sensor system to observe seismic vibration patterns that lead to detection of buried objects in unpaved roads. The system is capable of exciting soil acoustically and observing seismic responses while advancing at 1m/s with a 30m standoff. The optical design and build created 960 simultaneous independent spatial observations that collect data over a 0.5m x 1m area. A gimbal then repositions the sensor to collect a new region. In this sequential manner the system can scan 2m x 1km in less than 30min. Active gimbal stabilization kept beam positions relatively stable on the ground while the vehicle was in motion. Inertial sensing reduced gross Doppler components common to all channels. Even with these corrections, channel dropouts remained a challenge, so filtering of erroneous samples in time and space was required to improve the data quality. Automated target recognition algorithms quickly process the spatial vibration data to warn operators of a threat. We present here an overview of the system and collected data. The system proved effective at finding buried threats that produced seismic anomalies at the surface, but additional challenges lie in differentiating target responses from clutter. The seismic response of naturally occurring environmental clutter in roads produces responses that appear similar to objects of interest, reducing the effectiveness of target detection algorithms.

Here, we identify the construction of living buildings and infrastructure as a high-potential application domain for biohybrid robotics, and review technological advances relevant to its future development. Construction, civil infrastructure maintenance and building occupancy in the last decades have comprised a major portion of economic production, energy consumption and carbon emissions. Integrating biological organisms into automated construction tasks and permanent building components therefore has high potential for impact. Live materials can provide several advantages over standard synthetic construction materials, including self-repair of damage, increase rather than degradation of structural performance over time, resilience to corrosive environments, support of biodiversity, and mitigation of urban heat islands. Here, we review relevant technologies, which are currently disparate. They span robotics, self-organizing systems, artificial life, construction automation, structural engineering, architecture, bioengineering, biomaterials, and molecular and cellular biology. In these disciplines, developments relevant to biohybrid construction and living buildings are in the early stages, and typically are not exchanged between disciplines. We, therefore, consider this review useful to the future development of biohybrid engineering for this highly interdisciplinary application. © 2019 The Authors.","Review","Final","Scopus"

Because human failure is the most common reason for a successful cyberattack, human-factor researchers and psychologists might improve AV cybersecurity by researching how to decrease the probability of a successful attack. We review some areas of research connected to the human factor in cybersecurity and find many potential issues. Psychologists might research the characteristics of people prone to cybersecurity failure, the types of scenarios they fail in and the factors that influence this failure or over-trust of AV. Human behavior during a cyberattack might be researched, as well as how to educate people about cybersecurity. Multitasking has an effect on the ability to defend against a cyberattack and research is needed to set the appropriate policy. Human-resource researchers might investigate the skills required for personnel working in AV cybersecurity and how to detect potential defectors early. The psychological profile of cyber attackers should be investigated to be able to set policies to decrease their motivation. Finally, the decrease of driver's driving skills as a result of using AV and its connection to cybersecurity skills is also worth of research. © 2019 Linkov, Zámecník, Havlícková and Pai.","Review","Final","Scopus"

The behavior of workers at their workplace affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive corporate information. In addition, attackers exploit the “human factor” as a weak point with techniques such as phishing, malware, and social engineering. Exploiting the lack of awareness is often an easy task with minimal risk. To make employees aware of their important role, companies typically carry out security awareness campaigns. Our university created an e-Learning Platform (eLP) to support our awareness campaigns. In order to determine the success, the effectiveness and the impact of such an awareness campaign, suitable measurement methods are needed. A common approach to measure the success of eLPs is to run surveys and questionnaires with the learners. Since the manual evaluation of those surveys and questionnaires is a time-consuming task, we are researching how a possible automation can be achieved. Moreover, the effectiveness is often evaluated through quizzes or knowledge tests. Since knowledge by itself does not improve the behavior of people, the compliant-behavior has to be measured, too. We derived metrics for success and effectiveness but recognized that success can hardly be measured automatically. To reduce the manual effort we decided to only measure the effectiveness automatically. Therefore, we are measuring the behavior and determine if the security-compliance has increased. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Defenders need to keep pace by developing their own advances, which may preclude human-in-Theloop decision making. Consequently, future systems will have to rely on automated reasoning and automated responses to ensure mission success and continuously adapt to an evolving adversary. Automated reasoning about defensive cyber responses is essentially sequential decision making based on the projection of possible futures from a current situation. This problem is especially complicated in cyberspace, however, because the current situation and future projections are highly uncertain. Our research tackles these challenges using the formal framework of partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs). We show how to break the ""curse of dimensionality"" that makes these problems intractable by computing approximate solutions using a Monte Carlo online planner that incorporates a computationally feasible simulation of the cyber security problem. Our simulation is an extension of MITRE's Cyber Security Game simulator, which explores the mission-impact-focused strategies of an adaptive, intelligent attacker. Preliminary results on small problems, where the optimal solution can be calculated precisely, show that our approach consistently finds the optimal answer, not just a good approximation. We are in the process of increasing the fidelity of the simulator and POMDP representation to model more realistic cyber environments by increasing attacker and defender actions, increasing the variety of sensor types (including sensing of both actions and states), accounting for multiple incident effects, and improving the scaling properties. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

There is an interconnection of assembly lines, robot motion control systems, Automated Guided Vehicles (AVG) as well as a multitude of sensors and actuators. The key enablers of this development are at first the mobility and flexibility of the components due to the use of wireless connections, and secondly, the possibility of actively influencing the network management with Software Defined Network (SDN) approaches. Nevertheless, the use of this wireless communication solutions are accompanied by great risks, new attack vectors, and cyber security threats. The open nature and the broadcast characteristic suffer a huge potential for miscellaneous cyberattacks. Not only because of that, but there is a fundamental need for sound and secure authentication of participating entities and reliable encryption of transmitted data. However, traditional cryptographic applications come along with a lot of overhead in the form of complex computations and communication. Besides that, the new system often no longer have any interface to enter conventional credentials. In order to face these requirements, new methods have to be developed, which meet the demands of the industry such as low latency, low cost and, reliable communication. Within this work, Physical Layer Security (PhySec) approaches are used to derive and establish shared secret keys between participating entities. This Secret Key Generation (SKG) is based on characteristics of the wireless channel. It is shown that a transfer of the principle into Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) such as Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE+) or the upcoming Fifth Generation (5G) also perform as well.

Conventional methods dating back to 1950 were often tedious and susceptible to inter-observer variability, and preceding attempts to improve these traditional techniques have inadequately addressed the human expert inter-observer variability so as to significantly refine bone age evaluations. In this paper, an automated and efficient approach with regression convolutional neural network is proposed. This approach automatically exploits the carpal bones as the region of interest (ROI) and performs boundary extraction of carpal bones, then based on the regression convolutional neural network it evaluates the skeletal age from the left hand wrist radiograph of young children. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves an average discrepancy of 2.75 months between clinical and automatic bone age evaluations, and achieves 90.15% accuracy within 6 months from the ground truth for male.

The algorithm supports the integration of multiple sensors to increase the coverage at each viewpoint and reduce the mission time. A weighted heuristic reward function is developed in the algorithm to target coverage, accuracy, travelled distance and turning angle at each viewpoint. The iterative processes of the proposed algorithm were accelerated exploiting the parallel architecture of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). A set of experiments using models of different shapes were conducted in simulated and real environments.

For years, he worked diligently to carry out the missions that the favorite had entrusted to him. For a long time he was on top of the world, then the sky darkened and the coalition of his enemies came to the end of his perseverance. How could such a politician not feel the wind spin?

An integral part of these systems are the communication channels that allow the on-board systems to interact with passenger devices (e.g. tablets), ITS systems (e.g. road-side units), and other vehicles. These advances have significantly enlarged the attack surface and we already have numerous instances of successful penetration of vehicular networks both from inside the vehicle and from the outside. Traditional mechanisms for detecting and responding to such attacks are ill-suited to the vehicular domain mainly due to the fact that the entire process of dealing with an attack must be handled automatically and in a way that does not affect safety or severely impacts the continued availability of the vehicle or its key systems. Once a security breach is suspected, the system must evaluate the circumstances in order to determine whether the threat is real (and not a false positive) and select the optimal response through the use of an Intrusion Response System (IRS). Although IRSs have been adopted in other domains, there is a lack of such systems in the vehicular field. In this paper, we investigate the challenges and requirements for integrating such a mechanism inside a vehicle. In addition, we present an Intrusion Response System based on the Red-Zone principle which meets the identified requirements. Finally, we discuss the integration of IRS through the vehicle system development and the different aspects which support such a process. © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To address this challenge, we must be able to observe land surface temperatures within spatially complex urban environments. However, many existing remote sensing studies are based upon satellite or aerial imagery that capture temperature at coarse resolutions that fail to capture the spatial complexities of urban land surfaces that can change at a sub-meter resolution. This study seeks to fill this gap by evaluating the spatial variability of land surface temperatures through drone thermal imagery captured at high-resolutions (13 cm). In this study, flights were conducted using a quadcopter drone and thermal camera at two case study locations in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and El Paso, Texas. Results indicate that land use types exhibit significant variability in their surface temperatures (3.9-15.8 °C) and that this variability is influenced by surface material properties, traffic, weather and urban geometry. Air temperature and solar radiation were statistically significant predictors of land surface temperature (R2 0.37-0.84) but the predictive power of the models was lower for land use types that were heavily impacted by pedestrian or vehicular traffic. The findings from this study ultimately elucidate factors that contribute to land surface temperature variability in the urban environment, which can be applied to develop better temperature mitigation practices to protect human and environmental health. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Towards this end, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes allow multiple users and devices to communicate using the same temporal and spectral resources. In this context, buffer-aided (BA) relay selection can significantly enhance the quality and reliability of communication, through increased diversity. So, in this paper, we employ BA relay selection in the uplink of the NOMA networks where users and devices coexist and demand access to the wireless resources. The presented relay selection policy, namely flex - NOMA, facilitates simultaneous transmissions from multiple sources to multiple relays, exploiting channel state information at the reception, and dynamic decoding ordering by the relays performing successive interference cancellation (SIC). The theoretical analysis and performance evaluation results are provided and comparisons, in terms of outage probability, average sum-rate and average delay show that flex - NOMA offers improved performance without incurring high complexity and coordination overheads. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Among the areas examined is one around Minamitorishima Island, an exclusive economic zone of Japan, where marine sediments containing high concentrations of rare earths have been discovered on the seabed at about a depth of 6000 m. It is expected that this area will to be a potential mining area that can respond to future demand for expansion. Rare Earth, which is a type of rare earth element, is widely used in the automobile industry and semiconductor business field. For a stable supply of a mineral resource for these industries, it is quite essential to grow the mining business associated with sea floor mineral resources such as the rare earth element. However, for commercialization of ocean energy and mineral resources, except petroleum and natural gas, there are number of problems. These include those associated with the methods for assessing the viability, gathering and raising technology, separating and refining technology, measures for ecological protection and the preparation of laws and ordinances. In order to solve these problems, industry, academia and the Government in Japan are collaborating and our company is a core member of the rare earth mud development consortium established by Tokyo University as a main promoter. We hope to realize the exploitation of ocean mineral resources such as rare earth mud by applying the dredging technology that has been cultivated as a marine civil engineering operator for over a hundred years and the unmanned construction supporting systems for remote control of heavy machinery on site.

Specifically, information regarding the presence and orientation of unexploded ordinance (UXO) and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), as well as soil information is sought. Remote geophysical interrogation of the subsurface provides an opportunity to gain this information while reducing exposure to potentially hazardous situations. Efforts are currently underway to mount electromagnetic induction (EMI) devices on unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to support remote interrogation of high-threat areas, ingress and egress routing, permafrost mapping and existing infrastructure evaluation. This work consists of development of a UAS based EMI mapping platform for detection of runway embedded UXO for expedited runway remediation. Additionally, we consider a similar approach for a sensor intended to laterally map permafrost. The initial development phases of the UAS based EMI system require an understanding of the electromagnetic fields emitted by the UAS platform itself in order to optimize the performance of the system. Here we measure the fields emitted by two different UAS motor configurations at varying standoff distances ranging from 0-53 cm. Additionally, we evaluate the motor signatures under varying loads, and show interference on signatures of small UXO analogue targets. For this phase of investigation, shielding variables are not introduced. The results from the investigation allow for determination of the minimal platform to sensor standoff distance. These initial results indicate a minimum distance of 60 cm for the planned frequency ranges. © (2019) by Environmental and Engineering Geophysical Society All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The changes affecting the transport industry create a scenario of work intensification, characterized by different risk factors. Which working conditions contribute to this work intensification? And which impacts on health are perceived by professional drivers? A quantitative overview was adopted with the use of logistic regression models. The INSAT (Health and Work Survey) was used in two studies in Portugal: In a sample of 161 bus drivers; and in a sample of 336 drivers from both passenger and freight transport. The results showed that drivers experienced significant work-related health problems: Headache, back pain, musculoskeletal disorders, anxiety, fatigue and generalized discouragement. The results also points out that risks such as extending the number of working hours per day, dealing with tension situations with the public or feeling exploited at work are key factors that increase the perception of back pain, discouragement and anxiety. The analysis of the working conditions in the road transport acquires thus a renewed relevance today, since at this moment the mobility sector, especially the public transport service, is crossing a new – digital – frontier with the increasing automation (driverless vehicles). Will this “mobility of the future” (apparently) without worker be capable of soften the effects of work-related risks on drivers’ health? Or will it give rise to new forms of work intensification and consequently to new costs for workers’ health?. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

At some point, all available parallelism is exploited and performance improvements need to be sought elsewhere. As part of drug development trials, a compound is periodically administered, and the interactions between it and the human body are modeled through pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics by a set of ordinary differential equations. Numerical integration of these equations is the most computationally intensive part of the fitting process. For this task, parallelism brings little benefit. This paper describes how to exploit the nearly periodic nature of repeated administration models by numerical application of the method of averaging on the one hand and reusing previous computational effort on the other hand. The presented method can be applied on top of any existing integrator while requiring only a single tunable threshold parameter. Performance improvements and approximation error are studied on two pharmacometrics models. In addition, automated tuning of the threshold parameter is demonstrated in two scenarios. Up to 1.7-fold and 70-fold improvements are measured with the presented method for the two models respectively. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, only a small fraction of the ocean has been surveyed. Being able to estimate the 3D model of the environment from a single video eases the task of surveying the underwater environment, saves costs and opens doors to autonomous exploration of unknown environments. In order to estimate the 3D structure of a vehicle's surrounding environment, we propose a deep learning based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method. With our method, it is possible to predict a depth map of a given video frame while, at the same time, estimate the movement of the vehicle between different frames. Our method is completely self-supervised, meaning that it only requires a dataset of videos, without ground truth, to be trained. We propose a novel learning based depth map prior using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve the depth map prediction results. We evaluate the performance of our method on the KITTI dataset and on a private dataset of subsea inspection videos. We show that our method outperforms state of the art SLAM methods in both depth prediction and pose estimation tasks. In particular, our method achieves a mean Absolute Trajectory Error of 1.6 feet in our private subsea test dataset.

At the SG edge, widespread decentralisation of heterogeneous devices coupled with fluctuating energy availability and need as well as a greatly increased fluidity between their roles as energy producers, consumers, and stores raises significant challenges to ensuring robustness and security of both information and energy exchange. Detecting and mitigating both malicious and non-malicious threats in these environments is essential to the realisation of the full potential of the SG. To address this need for robust, localised, real-Time security at the grid edge we propose CONCEDE, a collaborative cross-layer ego-network integrity awareness and attack impact reduction extension to our previous work on delay-Tolerant cognitive adaptive energy exchange. We detail a substantial, targeted, energy disruption attack perpetrated by colluding mobile energy prosumers. Our CONCEDE proposal is then evaluated in multiple, diverse smart micro-grid (SMG) scenarios using hybrid traces of EVs and infrastructure from Europe, North America, and South America in the presence of a coordinated attack from malicious distributors seeking to disrupt energy supply to a target community.

Our algorithm plans receding horizon trajectories to maximally advance the robot along the racecourse, while taking into account the opponents’ intentions and responses. We build on our previous work (Spica et al Theoretic approach to autonomous two-player drone racing, 2018 [1]), which only considered racing with two robots. Our algorithm uses an iterative best response scheme with a new sensitivity term to find approximate Nash equilibria in the space of the multiple robots’ trajectories. The sensitivity term seeks Nash equilibria that are advantageous to the ego robot. We demonstrate our approach through extensive multi-player racing simulations, where our planner exhibits rich behaviors such as blocking, overtaking, nudging or threatening, similar to what we observe from racing with human participants. Statistics also reveal that our game theoretic planner largely outperforms a baseline model predictive controller that does not consider the opponents’ responses.

To complicate matters further, knowledge about the behavior and failure modes of a system are often collected in different models. We show how three of those models, namely attack trees, fault trees, and timed failure propagation graphs can be converted into Halpern-Pearl causal models, combined into a single holistic causal model, and analyzed with actual causality reasoning to detect and explain unwanted events. Halpern-Pearl models have several advantages over their source models, particularly that they allow for modeling preemption, consider the non-occurrence of events, and can incorporate additional domain knowledge. Furthermore, such holistic models allow for analysis across model boundaries, enabling detection and explanation of events that are beyond a single model. Our contribution here delineates a semi-automatic process to (1) convert different models into Halpern-Pearl causal models, (2) combine these models into a single holistic model, and (3) reason about system failures.

The main emphasis has been spent for the rail environment. The main driver is the possibility to realize cost effective solution for the modernization of the lines without losses in terms of safety. Furthermore, the rail community have recognized GNSS as one of the step charge innovation foreseen in the next generation train control systems. In the recent period, there has been some attempts to exploit the outcome of such studies even in the driverless car applications. As a matter of fact, these two transportation means share the same electromagnetical environment and both of them are subjected to constrained movement profile. Since one of the most important KI in the safety related application is represented by the integrity, we considered the presence of an external augmentation and integrity monitoring network. Particularly, we considered three different approaches for augmenting the PVT solution that are respectively the local area augmentation network, the wide area augmentation network and the 2-tiers augmentation schemes. For all these schemes we carried out the SWOT analysis considering the peculiarities of the application. On the basis of the SWOT, the system integrator can decide to implement the network that better suit its own requirement. In or vision, the best solution is to share a unique augmentation network for both rail and connected cars.

Such flows are characterized by very low values of turbulence intensity, and the main cause for transition corresponds to flow separation. Four different turbulence models for low-Reynolds-number flow are compared with the experimental data for a NACA 0018 airfoil over a range of two-dimensional as well as three-dimensional (3-D) conditions. The turbulence models under consideration are the k − ω shear-stress transport (SST) model with low-Reynolds-number modification, (k − ω SST) γ − Reθ model along with its simplified version in the form of the (k − ω SST) γ model, and k − kl − ω model. The NACA 0018 profile is rotated in a flow with a chord-based Reynolds number of 3 × 105 at three different rotational speeds between an angle of attack of 0 and 25 deg. Using a curve fitting methodology, an estimate of the results at an infinitesimally slow rotation can be made. Both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations are considered to allow an assessment of the model for predicting steady hysteresis.

The presented localization method consists of rough and fine localizations. The rough localization exploits the modified Kalman filtering, which produces the rough location estimates of a high-speed object. Due to an inappropriate threshold value, the rough estimates often lead to a divergence in the modified Kalman filtering. In this paper, the fine localization suppresses the divergence. The proposed fine localization is based on a deep learning technique. Using the rough estimates, the deep learning method classifies the current position of the high-speed object into an appropriate region. Based on the classified region, the rough location estimates are refined into the fine location estimates in the fine-localization step. The experimental results verify that the deep learning approach overcomes the weakness of the modified Kalman method in the localization. The results also show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional Kalman approach in the localization of high-speed objects. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, it is difficult to obtain enough scenes training data in a real sea navigation environment. In response to possible emergency situations even no shorestation support, this paper proposes a method using conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN) to generate the most executable large-scale target ships image set, which can be used to training various sea conditions autonomous decision-making model. In practice, most of the current research on unmanned ships are based onshore remote control or monitoring. Nonetheless, in some extremely special circumstances, such as communication interruption, or if the ship cannot be guided or remotely controlled in real time on the shore, the unmanned ship must make an appropriate decision and form new plans according to the encounter targets and the whole current situation. The CGAN model is a novel means to generate the target ships to construct the whole encounter sea scenes situation. The generated targets training image set can be used to train decision models, and explore a new way to approach large-scale, fully autonomous navigation decisions. © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, the adoption of UAV-SCs involves the planning of their missions over time, which includes the scheduling of recharging actions of each UAV-SC at ground sites. Typically, the energy needed to recharge UAV-SCs is derived from the grid, which can be coupled with microgeneration exploiting renewable energy sources (e.g., solar panels). In this architecture, the energy that is locally produced can be either sold to the grid or used to recharge the UAV-SCs. On the other hand, when the energy from microgeneration is insufficient for recharging the UAV-SCs, additional energy can be bought from the grid. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between maximizing the throughput provided by the UAV-SCs over a set of areas, maximizing energy sold to the grid, and maximizing energy bought from the grid. The proposed model, MaxUAVProfit, is designed to (i) plan the UAV-SCs missions as a sequence of positions and actions in 3D space vs. time, (ii) manage the grid-connected microgeneration, and (iii) control the amount of throughput received by each hotspot. We then evaluate the MaxUAVProfit in a realistic scenario, which is based on the measurement of real cellular metrics and a realistic UAV-SC energy consumption model. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of the MaxUAVProfit with respect to other competing solutions, which include either optimization of microgeneration or maximization of the area throughput. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Seismic surveys are the key part of petroleum exploration. Reflected sound waves are used to produce a 3D subsurface geological model, which helps to take a decision on drilling location for potential hydrocarbon resources. Seismic surveys are very complex operations, and growing energy demand pushes exploration activities into highly challenging environments, for example areas covered with surface ice, which necessitate exceptionally sophisticated approaches. We have carried out state-of-the-art studies on the use of unmanned aerial systems and autonomous underwater vehicles during seismic data acquisition procedures in such environments. Our conclusion is that both of these techniques are highly relevant for all stages of seismic operations offshore. We have also studied the possible effects on marine life from the sound waves, which are introduced during these surveys. We have found that great caution must be exercised in whale’s habitat; and recommend further studies on the direct effects. © 2019, Lulea University of Technology.

Results of previous studies in asymptomatic CAD were heterogeneous in retinal layer changes measured by OCT. The objectives of this prospective, non-interventional study were to investigate if structural retinal changes occur in symptomatic CAD patients with macroangiopathic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Methods: We used spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) to cross-sectionally and longitudinally analyze the retinal morphology of CAD patients with macroangiopathic ischemic stroke or TIA not permanently affecting the visual pathway. We employed semi-automated segmentation of macular volume scans to assess the macular retinal layers' thickness and peripapillary ring scans to determine the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness using the contralateral eye and eyes of microangiopathic ischemic stroke patients with matched age, gender, and vascular risk factors as control. Visual function and visual field deficits were assessed by multifocal visual evoked potentials (mfVEP). Results: Neither the thickness of retinal layers measured by SD-OCT in 17 patients nor the mfVEP latency or amplitude in 10 patients differed between the symptomatic stenotic, the contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA) side and the control group of 17 microangiopathic stroke patients at baseline. Furthermore, longitudinal investigations of 10 patients revealed no significant changes of any retinal layer 4 months after ischemic stroke or TIA. Conclusion: In conclusion, our study revealed no evidence for an impact of symptomatic carotid artery disease on retinal structure or functional impairment of the visual pathway. © 2019 Lee, Gemerzki, Boerker, Guthoff, Aktas, Gliem, Jander, Hartung and Albrecht.

Blockchain can provide a good solution to the issue of secure message dissemination or secure information sharing in vehicular networks with a weak trust relationship among the nodes. In this paper, we investigate the design of a regional blockchain for VANETs, where the blockchain is shared among nodes in a geographically bounded area. We investigate how to design the regional blockchain while achieving a low 51% attack success probability. We derive a condition that guarantees a low 51% attack success probability in terms of the numbers of good nodes and malicious nodes, the message delivery time, and the puzzle computation time. The condition can provide a useful guideline for selection of several control parameters guaranteeing the stable operation of the blockchain. We run several simulations to show the validity of the condition and investigate the effects of various parameters on the 51% attack success probability.

In order to effectively resist possible spoofing threats, a series of anti-spoofing algorithms have been developed. The Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) is a commonly used anti-spoofing method and has been widely used in various fields. The algorithm exploits the consistency among satellites and utilizes the transmit time of each navigation signal to perform spoofing detection. However, RAIM only focuses on the code phase information of the navigation signal and does not utilize the carrier portion. In some scenarios, it is feasible and effective to utilize the information held in the carrier. In this paper, carrier doppler check are integrated with RAIM by using time-domain difference method, which makes the algorithm applicable to more spoofing scenarios.

The proposed approach is founded on the concept of swarm behavior in multi-agent systems, i.e., a self-formed and self-coordinated team of UAVs which adapts itself to mission-specific environmental layouts. The swarm formation and coordination are inspired by biological mechanisms of flocking and stigmergy, respectively. These mechanisms, suitably combined, make it possible to strike the right balance between global search (exploration) and local search (exploitation) in the environment. The swarm adaptation is based on an evolutionary algorithm with the objective of maximizing the number of tracked targets during a mission or minimizing the time for target discovery. A simulation testbed has been developed and publicly released, on the basis of commercially available UAVs technology and real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed approach extends and sensibly outperforms a similar approach in the literature. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

One of these examples is a command injection issue on a gateway ECU, which was reported in 2016. In order to mitigate these threats, the secure design of connected vehicle systems, which is done at the concept phase during development, has become increasingly important in industry. From this perspective, a security guideline such as JASO TP15002 which specifies two concrete methods, CRSS (CVSS Based Risk Scoring System) and RSMA (Risk Scoring Methodology for Automotive System), was made public in 2015. The latest work on the application of TP15002 to the ITU-T X.1373 standard was published in 2017. However, the risk assessment in this publication seems limited. It is not clear from this publication how systematically the risk assessment task in TP15002 can be performed at the implementation level. Another interesting question is how different methods affect the risk scores of connected vehicle systems. In this paper, we focus on the risk assessment phase in JASO TP15002. For a systematic risk assessment, we introduce an idea of asset container and propose to extend CRSS to a novel RSS (Risk Scoring System), RSS-CVSSv3, by appropriately replacing CVSSv2 vulnerability scoring system on which CRSS is based with CVSSv3. To address the above questions, we perform a comparative study on CRSS, RSMA, and RSS-CVSSv3 for multiple use cases such as a CGW (Central Gateway) and a drone, to examine the efficiency and usefulness of our methods. For this comparative purpose, we devise an interesting approach for the refinement of RSMA to the obstacles in comparing CRSS with RSMA. © 2019 Yasuyuki Kawanishi et al.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Yet, several studies have documented behavioral or physiological responses to close-proximity UAS flights. We experimentally tested whether American black bears (Ursus americanus) habituate to repeated UAS exposure and whether tolerance levels persist during an extended period without UAS flights. Using implanted cardiac biologgers, we measured heart rate (HR) of five captive bears before and after the first of five flights each day. Spikes in HR, a measure of stress, diminished across the five flights within each day and over the course of 4 weeks of twice-weekly exposure. We halted flights for 118 days, and when we resumed, HR responses were similar to that at the end of the previous trials. Our findings highlight the capacity of a large mammal to become and remain habituated to a novel anthropogenic stimulus in a relatively short time (3-4 weeks). However, such habituation to mechanical noises may reduce their wariness of other human threats. Also, whereas cardiac effects diminished, frequent UAS disturbances may have other chronic physiological effects that were not measured. We caution that the rate of habituation may differ between wild and captive animals: while the captive bears displayed large initial spikes in HR change (albeit not as large as wild bears), these animals were accustomed to regular exposure to humans and mechanical noises that may have hastened habituation to the UAS. © 2018 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

Briefly defined, such a smart home has special electronics to enable the remote control of automated devices specifically designed for remote health care to ensure the safety of the patient at home and the supervision of their health status. These sensors are linked to a local intelligence unit responsible for analyzing sensor data, detecting emergency situations, and interfacing between the patient at home and a set of people involved in their health care, such as doctors, nurses, emergency services, and paramedics. Smart homes can improve the patient's quality of life and safety through the innovative use of advanced technologies. Telemedicine and telecare are driving forces behind the adoption of smart homes. The telecare medicine information system (TMIS) has drawn worldwide attention for the past 20 years, as modern technologies have made remote delivery of healthcare a reality. TMIS using multidisciplinary research and application involves advanced technologies in information processing, telecommunications, bio-sensing, and artificial intelligence including smart technologies. TMIS leverages the latest mobile and wireless communication technologies and widely available internet infrastructure to deliver quality services to home patients enabling them to remotely access information about their health and obtain telemedical services. TMIS delivers capabilities to remotely provide 24\times 7 health care facilities to patients. Its purpose is to provide patients with convenient and expedited remote health care services, greatly improving the quality and efficiency of health care services. However, the open and insecure nature of the internet poses a number of security threats to patient secrecy and privacy. Security design for TMIS is not trivial. Essential security and privacy are provided by mutual authentication and key agreement protocols. This paper proposes an efficient and secure, bilinear pairing-based, unlink-able, mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for TMIS. The proposed protocol adopts a fuzzy extractor for the identification of patients using the biometric data. The security of the proposed protocol is based on the hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) and elliptic curve computational Diffie-Hellman problem (ECCDHP) to preserve the privacy of the user. The detailed security analysis is discussed, and the results of comparison are provided. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

As the self-driving vehicle cannot achieve full-condition driving without human driver yet and still have a long time to go, the collaborative driving can exploit both machine and human specialties, which requires human and vehicle intelligence to control the vehicle simultaneously and work together. However, there were a few studies focusing on the HVCD that experimental environment and evaluation methods are rarely discussed, even under the simulation conditions, which limits the development of collaborative driving. To bridge the significant gaps, this paper designed simple semi-physical simulation system architecture for the HVCD. First, the simple designed system can achieve basic functions, including human control input as the normal driver, vehicle intelligence with local and global sensor data process and decision fusion. The presented system can use and process this multi-source information to achieve the HVCD in the simulated environment. Second, the evaluation method based on vehicle driving safety, stability, and rapidity is proposed and discussed, which matters most for system performance test and feasibility verification. In addition, experiments with different decision fusion conditions were presented and the experimental results show that the proposed simple semi-physical HVCD simulation system can work smoothly and reflect the practical scenario. Furthermore, the performance of different fusion weights experiments shows the advantages of both human driver and vehicle intelligence, which provides a reference for the HVCD related research improvement. © 2019 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In a vehicular plane of the VANETs, vehicles communicate with each other for various safety and non-safety applications. In future, the autonomous CAVs communication will not only be of type broadcast but also unicast in nature using multi-hop communication. Both broadcast and unicast multi-hop communication of VANETs are vulnerable to various types of attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS), message falsification, Sybil attack, Greyhole, Blackhole, and Wormhole attack. This paper aims to utilize the power of machine learning to detect wormhole attack in multi-hop communication of VANETs. Although various mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to detect this attack, the ML-based approach for wormhole has not been explored. To model the attack in VANET, we create a scenario of multi-hop communication using AODV routing protocol on NS3 simulator that uses the mobility traces generated by the SUMO traffic simulator. We run the simulation and collect the statistics generated using the flow monitor tool. These collected traces are preprocessed, and then k-NN and SVM are applied on this preprocessed file to make the model learn of wormhole attack. The performance of these two machine learning models is compared in terms of detection accuracy and four alarm types. Our study demonstrates that ML is a powerful tool, which can help deal with such attacks in a multi-hop communication of future generation CAVs. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This network is based on the exploitation of the licensed spectrum bands during the absence of their owners. It brings new secondary users that should observe the environment to identify the spectrum holes and exploit them as long as they don’t interfere with the owners. These capabilities are realized based on cognitive cycle that enables observing the environment, analysing the observations, learning, deciding and acting to improve the performance. Hence, spectrum management solutions for cognitive radio networks are essential for efficient utilization of the radio resources, and they are decisive to allow spectrum sharing between different radio communication systems.

Guaranteeing the security of these networks and the data exchanged is key to ensuring the safety and privacy of passengers on public roads. The use of conventional infrastructure and technologies for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) results in centralized environments with potential privacy concerns and are vulnerable to spoofing and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. We contend that some of these vulnerabilities can be mitigated via distributed-ledger technologies (DLT) such as blockchain (BC) and directed acyclic graphs (DAG). By using an append-only ledger system, it is possible to establish consensus among peers with regards to which transactions to keep as well as their validity in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion. A consortium based DLT framework would provide some level of trust in a distributed ledger network (DLN) by only allowing consensus among preselected nodes. The use of such technology as part of an ITS managed by a consortium of transportation organizations (e.g., government, insurance companies, vehicle manufacturers) would provide decentralized computing, authentication, validation, consensus, and fault tolerance at much lower costs than alternative solutions. As an example use case, it could provide attestation of transportation-related events such as traffic jams and accidents as well as snapshots of vehicle information such as maintenance records or odometer readings. This paper explores the use of a consortium DLT-based architecture to augment vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)/ITS capabilities and serve as the source of event attestation. It describes the effectiveness of this technology in securing against different types of attacks and expected implementation challenges. It also discusses how this approach could provide a form of privacy control to vehicle owners. Finally, it proposes additional DLT research that could lead to improvements in scalability, consensus and validation mechanisms, and incentives for organizations involved. © 2019 14th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ICCWS 2019.

In the USSR, the number of aerial ropeways reached 190 at the cargo transport volume of 116 Mt yearly and the ropeway length of 60 km. The comparison of the technical and economic performance of motor, railway, conveyor transport with aerial ropeways shows that the latter has some strategic advantages over the other types of solid mineral transportation. Furthermore, these advantages are of the primary concern for the remote areas in the North and Far East of Russia. The benefits of the aerial ropeways include independence fro relief and atmospheric conditions, feasibility of routing along the shortest distance between the loading and unloading points, etc. Regarding actual performance, the aerial ropeways are recommended for transportation of cargo in amount from 0.5 to 5 Mt/yr for a distance to a few kilometers. Subject to approximately equal initial capital investment with motor transport, aerial ropeways are advantageous in terms of operating cost by a factor of 4–5. Construction of a unique aerial ropeway undertaken by Russia in the extremely difficult mining ad technical conditions of the Kashkadarya Region in Uzbekistan is reflective of the large scientific and technological potential offered by experts and companies from Russia. R&D projects accomplished in Russian in the late years (automated control of hauling equipment, new materials, etc.) allow the aerial ropeways to be assumed as advanced and efficient type of transportation for granular (loose) materials compliable with the concept of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. © 2019, Publishing house Mining book.

In this paper, we aim at developing an efficient algorithm for the joint transmit power and UAV trajectory design via maximizing the minimum average throughput in a UAV-enabled network. The conventional method to tackle this problem is to optimize transmit power or trajectory in an alternative manner, which generally incurs high computational complexities. Moreover, how to find a favorable initial point is a challenging task. To this end, we impose a novel constraint by assuming that the UAV will not communicate until it approaches the closest position to a user, thus transforming the initial problem into an approximate one with reduced variables. Based on this result, we further propose two low-complexity algorithms by exploiting the alternating directional method of multipliers (ADMM), whose updating step is performed in closed-form solutions. In the first algorithm, both UAV trajectory and transmit power are determined simultaneously. We also propose a second algorithm which iteratively optimizes transmit power and trajectory. The simulation results show that by using the proposed ADMM-based algorithms, one can achieve higher performance than state-of-the-art methods with reduced computation time. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

We then target the maximization of the energy stored in the UAVs and in the ground sites, by ensuring the coverage of the territory through the scheduling of the UAV missions over space and time. After providing the problem formulation, we face its complexity by proposing a decomposition-based approach and by designing a brand-new genetic algorithm. The results, obtained over a set of representative case studies, reveal that there exists a trade-off between the UAVs battery level, the ground sites battery level, and the level of coverage. In addition, both the decomposed version and the genetic algorithm perform sufficiently close to the integrated model, with a strong improvement in the computation times. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The Bahrain Field was discovered in the early 1930s and is recognized as the first oil field developed in the Arabian Gulf. Recently, Tatweer Petroleum introduced advanced Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), also known as (Drones), to address the unique needs of its daily operation by providing a safe, efficient, and cost-effective maintenance and inspection solutions. This paper demonstrates the valuable benefits of utilizing UAV (Drones) in the oil and gas industry in three main areas: 'Security, Surveillance, and Emergency Response,' 'Inspection and Maintenance,' and 'Surveying and Mapping.' Under the Security and Surveillance front, Tatweer Petroleum is facing operational safety issues and security threats that require real-time response solutions, and the need to provide rapid, precise, and reliable situational awareness. Tatweer's Drones support the Security team with dynamic perimeter surveillance, intruder alerts, and critical equipment and process monitoring. Additionally, the Drones are used to support the emergency response team as a professional tool for rapid aerial incident investigation, evacuation, monitoring, and remote hazard detection. Preventive maintenance inspection is another application area where Drones can play a vital role. This is especially true when it comes to inaccessible operational assets due to their physical location (e.g. overhead power lines insulators), sheer magnitude (e.g. solar cell farm), or an inherent process hazard (e.g. flare stacks). Airborne cameras with advanced spectral imaging technology and powerful magnification optics can capture, analyze, and identify particular anomalies such as oil or gas leaks and pre-failure overheats, and provide vivid close-up images of fatigued structures and micro failures in plants and assets. This is a great cost-effective and efficient method for inspection and failure prevention. Surveying and mapping an industrial environment is time-consuming, difficult, and often dangerous. Tatweer Petroleum used the Drones to allow surveyors and mappers to collect unlimited aerial data with precise measurements, while saving time, money, and manpower. It also provides premium processing and analytics capabilities to support critical processes such as stock pile volume measurements, terrain mapping, site planning etc. The Drones are preprogrammed to automatically cover any particular area in the Bahrain Field. The survey data produces highly accurate, best-in-class orthophotos and digital elevation models. © 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Ships are increasingly using systems that rely on digitization, integration, and automation, which calls for cyber risk management on and off-shore. As of 2017, there were more than 52,000 merchant ships sailing the Cyber Seas. Despite the increased danger of cyber-attacks on the high seas and in sea ports around the globe, internationally binding cybersecurity regulations for the maritime industry have not been adopted. However, effective risk management in the maritime sector, specifically to identify, assess, detect, respond to and recover has been recently raised by the United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO) in its 2016 Guidelines on maritime cybersecurity. Technological advances in the shipping industry, such as autonomous ships, drones, robotics, various blockchain applications, and deep level machine learning hold considerable promise for the supply side of shipping. However, there is still uncertainty within the maritime industry regarding possible safety, security and cybersecurity incidents, as well as concern about the diminishing role of seafarers, mostly from the developing world. As the future of technological advances in shipping is expanded, the existing legal, policy and regulatory frameworks must be adapted and new frameworks written, as required, at both the national and international levels. The strategic plan for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted in December 2017 recognizes the need to integrate new and emerging technologies into the regulatory framework for shipping. The evolution of the Belt and Road Initiative in the South China Sea also bear major implications for the shipping and maritime trade, as do recent regulatory requirements governing cyber security and privacy rights in the European Union. Through empirical evidence this paper explores the legal implications including the rights and duties of the maritime industry in protecting against unlawful intrusions into cyber systems, while at the same time advancing recommendations for legal frameworks and regulations essential to ensure safety and security on the Cyber Sea. © 2019 14th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ICCWS 2019.

During the algorithm iteration execution, each particle evaluates its fitness function according to the actual position. Then, every particle moves towards a direction dependent on its actual best position and the position of the best particle so far. The procedure ends when the iteration limit is reached or fitness criterium is met. In the presented autonomous UAV 3D path planning method, a PSO algorithm is used to build a feasible path, optimized in terms of fuel and threat cost. The process begins when the UAV detects or receives information about threats appearing on its primary trajectory. The population of particles moves in the search space of three variables, which are the angles of pitch, roll and yaw. These angles determine the spatial orientation of the UAV, indicating its direction of movement in each step. Further waypoints are chosen with consideration of the distance to the target and violation of threat areas. As a final result, the PSO algorithm constructs a suboptimal, feasible path which could be used as a reference trajectory for the UAV's automatic control system. Simulation results turned out to be completely repeatable and indistinguishable, despite the stochastic nature of the algorithm, which proves its great optimization abilities. Moreover, its short execution time (within seconds) allows this procedure to be used in real time applications. © 2019 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Biometric is one of the most trustworthy authenticators and is presently being advocated to use in the remote authentication of TMIS. However, most of the existing TMISs consider a single-server-environment-based authentication system. Therefore, patients need to register and log into every server separately for different services. Furthermore, these schemes do not employ error correction technique to remove the errors from biometric data. Also, biometrics are inherent and demand diversification to generate a revocable template from inherent biometric data. In this paper, we propose a mutual authentication and key agreement scheme for a multi-medical server environment to overcome the limitations of the existing schemes. In the proposed scheme, a cancelable transformation of the raw biometric data is used to provide the privacy and the diversification of biometric data. The errors of the biometric data are corrected with error-correction techniques under the fuzzy commitment mechanism. A formal security analysis using the widely accepted real-or-random model, the Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic, and the automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool concludes that the proposed scheme is safe against known attacks. We also compare the computation and communication costs of our scheme to evaluate the performance with the others. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Moreover, remote sensing technology, which enables the observation of the Earth's surface and is currently very common in environmental research, has many limitations such as insufficient spatial, spectral and temporal resolution and a high cost of data acquisition. Since the 1990s, researchers have been exploring the potential of different types of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for monitoring Earth's surface. The present study reviews recent scientific literature dealing with the use of UAV in environmental biology. Amongst numerous papers, short communications and conference abstracts, we selected 110 original studies of how UAVs can be used in environmental biology and which organisms can be studied in this manner. Most of these studies concerned the use of UAV to measure the vegetation parameters such as crown height, volume, number of individuals (14 studies) and quantification of the spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation changes (12 studies). UAVs were also frequently applied to count birds and mammals, especially those living in the water. Generally, the analytical part of the present study was divided into following sections: (1) detecting, assessing and predicting threats on vegetation, (2) measuring the biophysical parameters of vegetation, (3) quantifying the dynamics of changes in plants and habitats and (4) population and behaviour studies of animals. At the end, we also synthesised all the information showing, amongst others, the advances in environmental biology because of UAV application. Considering that 33% of studies found and included in this review were published in 2017 and 2018, it is expected that the number and variety of applications of UAVs in environmental biology will increase in the future. © 2018 Maciej M.

In this context, the exact 2D position of road markings as well as height information play an important role in, e.g., lane-accurate self-localization of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, the overall task is divided into an automatic segmentation followed by a refined 3D reconstruction. For the segmentation task, we applied a wavelet-enhanced fully convolutional network on multiview high-resolution aerial imagery. Based on the resulting 2D segments in the original images, we propose a successive workflow for the 3D reconstruction of road markings based on a least-squares line-fitting in multiview imagery. The 3D reconstruction exploits the line character of road markings with the aim to optimize the best 3D line location by minimizing the distance from its back projection to the detected 2D line in all the covering images. Results showed an improved IoU of the automatic road marking segmentation by exploiting the multiview character of the aerial images and a more accurate 3D reconstruction of the road surface compared to the semiglobal matching (SGM) algorithm. Further, the approach avoids the matching problem in non-textured image parts and is not limited to lines of finite length. In this paper, the approach is presented and validated on several aerial image data sets covering different scenarios like motorways and urban regions. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this work, we propose ShapeShifter, an attack that tackles the more challenging problem of crafting physical adversarial perturbations to fool image-based object detectors like Faster R-CNN. Attacking an object detector is more difficult than attacking an image classifier, as it needs to mislead the classification results in multiple bounding boxes with different scales. Extending the digital attack to the physical world adds another layer of difficulty, because it requires the perturbation to be robust enough to survive real-world distortions due to different viewing distances and angles, lighting conditions, and camera limitations. We show that the Expectation over Transformation technique, which was originally proposed to enhance the robustness of adversarial perturbations in image classification, can be successfully adapted to the object detection setting. ShapeShifter can generate adversarially perturbed stop signs that are consistently mis-detected by Faster R-CNN as other objects, posing a potential threat to autonomous vehicles and other safety-critical computer vision systems.

These games may pit a friendly blue force against an opposing red force, with a ""greyspace"" separating the two teams. Effective wargames simulate real environments and incorporate elements of user patterns of life and adversarial activity. Virtualized environments are typically used to prevent unintended damage to production systems and to enable the snapshotting and resetting of environments on an as-needed basis. These environments need to replicate not only a network that is to be defended, but also the infrastructure used by attackers as well as the intermediate Internet nodes between those networks. The high administrative overhead cost of setting up and maintaining these virtual environments can preclude some organizations from using wargames to train their workforce or to validate their tactics and strategies. In this paper, we discuss the methods and technologies used by Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute to create and run some of the largest cyber wargames for the United States Department of Defense and other federal agencies. We present an integrated set of open source utilities that are used to create the infrastructure to be used in the virtualized environment. Utilities developed by Carnegie Mellon researchers and made freely available as open source projects, are then used to configure environments and deploy them. Among these, the GreyBox and TopGen utilities are used to simulate a realistic Internet infrastructure and content within that infrastructure to link the defending and attacking networks. The Ghosts user simulation utility orchestrates non-player characters during the wargame to conduct automated actions through the simulated Internet so realistic network traffic and system interaction can be baselined by the defending force and/or exploited by the attacking force. Additional SEI tools are used to enrich networks with simulated industrial controls systems and emulated wireless networks. Finally, control and telemetry data from various utilities are rendered invisible to participants so they can focus on accomplishing their objectives. These same tools and techniques can be leveraged as cyber warfare research and experimentation testbeds for academic purposes. © 2019 14th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ICCWS 2019.

The explainable model is on a visual platform in the format of if-then rules derived from the Sugeno-type fuzzy inference model. The model is tested using the data recorded from three different missions. In each mission, adverse weather, conditions and enemy locations are introduced at random locations along the path of the mission. There are two phases to the model development. In the first phase, the Mamdani fuzzy model is used to create rules to steer the UAV along the designated mission and the rules of engagement when it encounters weather and enemy locations along and near its chosen mission. The data are gathered as UAV traverses on each mission. In the second phase, the data gathered from these missions are used to create a reverse model using a Sugeno-type fuzzy inference system based on the subtractive clustering in the data. The model has seven inputs (time, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, heading direction, engage in attack, continue mission, and steer UAV) and two outputs (weather conditions and distance from the enemy). This model predicts the outputs regarding the weather conditions and enemy positions whenever UAV deviates from the predefined path. The model is optimized with respect to the number of rules and prediction accuracy by adjusting subtractive clustering parameters. The model is then fine-tuned with ANFIS. The final model has six rules and root mean square error value that is less than 0.05. Furthermore, to check the robustness of the model, the Gaussian random noise is added to a UAV path, and the prediction accuracy is validated. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

A lot of applica-tions are being developed using aerial vehicles as a pivot. These vehicles provide a vast range of support to modern day networks. Modern computing applications such as Urban Computing, Internet of Things, Ubiquitous Computing, and the Internet for All have sought applications of UAVs to attain complex tasks. However, securing aerial vehicles in a network is not an easy task because of the difference in communication standards and range of applicability. Aerial nodes are prone to various types of attack in a network such as Sybil attack, wormhole attack, sinkhole attack, or impersonation attack. These attacks lead to a large number of vulnerabilities causing fatal incidents. A new attack is introduced in this paper termed as “Coagulation Attack”. This term is derived from the clotting properties of fluids. This paper introduces the concept, issues, challenges, and research aspects of coagulation attack.

Safe and secure road transport is a major societal and political objective, which is substantiated by the concrete goal of the European Commission to “move close to zero fatalities in road transport” (White Paper of the European Commission Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area—Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system, 2011, page 10.) within the next three decades. One historically often neglected aspect of this objective in automotive system development is security, i.e., freedom from maliciously implemented threats. In the automotive software industry, model-based engineering is the current state of the practice. Instead of integrating security into the entire system development process, it currently tends to be an afterthought. Because of the tight interdependencies and integration of components, the consequences of gaping security flaws are grave. The contribution of this paper is a secure modeling approach enabling the automotive engineer to analyze the software system in the context of industrial model-based engineering in an early phase. The security modeling language specification is presented as a proposed annex to the relevant industry standard EAST-ADL, and therefore offers a common modeling approach for architectural and security aspects. All security extensions are in line with this standard and its meta level, which is shared with AUTOSAR. The security modeling language specification is demonstrated in a small modeling example, along with a formal evaluation which applies the Grounded Theory method to a set of expert interviews, showing that it is comprehensive and embraces even non-standardized pertinent research. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The quality of the information derived from these point clouds is dependent on a range of variables, including the type and structure of the forest, weather conditions and flying parameters. A key requirement to achieve accurate estimates of height based metrics describing forest structure is a source of ground information. This study explores the availability and reliability of ground surface points available within point clouds captured in six forests of different structure (canopy cover and height), using three image capture and processing strategies, consisting of nadir, oblique and composite nadir/oblique image networks. The ground information was extracted through manual segmentation of the point clouds as well as through the use of two commonly used ground filters, LAStools lasground and the Cloth Simulation Filter. The outcomes of these strategies were assessed against ground control captured with a Total Station. Results indicate that a small increase in the number of ground points captured (between 0 and 5% of a 10 m radius plot) can be achieved through the use of a composite image network. In the case of manually identified ground points, this reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) error of the terrain model by between 1 and 11 cm, with greater reductions seen in plots with high canopy cover. The ground filters trialled were not able to exploit the extra information in the point clouds and inconsistent results in terrain RMSE were obtained across the various plots and imaging network configurations. The use of a composite network also provided greater penetration into the canopy, which is likely to improve the representation of mid-canopy elements. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

High yields (>60%) under optimized conditions frequently revert to low yields (<20%) in large scale, automated syntheses. Competing side reactions and concomitant complex reaction mixtures contribute to substantial loss of product during HPLC clean-up. Objective: To develop alternative precursors for facile routine clinical manufacture of [18F]FAZA that are compatible with current equipment and automated procedures. Methods: Two new precursors, 1-α-D-(2',3'-di-O-acetyl-5'-O-(4-nitrobenzene)sulfonyl-arabinofuranosyl)-2- nitroimidazole (DiAcNosAZA) and 1-α-D-(2',3'-di-O-acetyl-5'-iodo-arabinofuranosyl)-2-nitroimidazole (DiAcIAZA), were synthesized from commercially-available 1-α-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-nitroimidazole (AZA). A commercial automated synthesis unit (ASU) was used to condition F-18 for anhydrous radiofluorination, and to radiofluorinate DiAcNosAZA and DiAcIAZA using the local standardized protocol to manufacture [18F]FAZA from AcTosAZA. Results: DiAcNosAZA was synthesized via two pathways, in recovered yields of 29% and 40%, respectively. The nosylation of 1-α-D-(2',3'-di-O-acetyl-arabinofuranosyl)-2-nitroimidazole (DiAcAZA) featured a strong competing reaction that afforded 1-α-D-(2',3'-di-O-acetyl-5'-chloro-arabinofuranosyl)-2- nitroimidazole (DiAcClAZA) in 55% yield. Radiofluorination yields were better from DiAcNosAZA and DiAcIAZA than from DiAcTosAZA, and the presence of fewer side products afforded higher purity [18F]FAZA preparations. Several radioactive and non-radioactive by products of radiofluorination were assigned tentative chemical structures based on co-chromatography with authentic reference compounds. Conclusion: DiAcClAZA, a major side-product in the preparation of DiAcNosAZA, and its deprotected analogue (ClAZA), are unproven hypoxic tissue radiosensitizers.

CEW is a massive and challenging project, and due to the sensitivity of the data sources, there are few open studies that have investigated CEW. Moreover, the spatial sparsity, continuous action, and partially observable environment that exist in CEW have greatly limited the abilities of DRL algorithms, which strongly depend on state-value and action-value functions. In this paper, we use Python to build a 3-D space game named Explorer to simulate various CEW environments in which the electronic attacker is an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) and the defender is an observation station, both of which are equipped with radar as the observation sensor. In our game, the UCAV needs to accomplish the task of detecting the target as early as possible to perform follow-up tracking and guidance tasks. To allow an 'infant' UCAV to understand what 'target searching' is, we train the UCAV's maneuvering strategies by means of a well-designed reward shaping, a simplified constant accelerated motion control, and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm based on a generative model and variational Bayesian estimation. The experimental results show that when the operating cycle is 0.2s , the search success rate of the trained UCAV in 10 000 episodes is improved by 33.36% compared with the benchmark, and the target destruction rate is similarly improved by 57.84%. © 2019 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, most of research projects related to robotics does not discuss security issues, moving on directly to studying classical problems (i.e., perception, control, planning). This paper evaluates the effects of availability issues (Denial of Service attacks) in two commonly used commercially available UAVs (AR.Drone 2.0 and 3DR SOLO). Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are made while the vehicles are navigating, simulating common conditions found both by the general public and in a research scenario. Experiments show how effective such attacks are and demonstrate actual security breaches that create specific vulnerabilities. The results indicate that both studied UAVs are susceptible to several types of DoS attacks which can critically influence the performance of UAVs during navigation, including a decrease in camera functionality, drops in telemetry feedback and lack of response to remote control commands. We also present a tool that can be used as a failsafe mechanism to alert the user when a drone is reaching out a determined flight limit range, avoiding availability issues. © 2019 Kohat University of Science and Technology.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The development of new (weapon) technologies (e.g. precision-guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles) represents opportunity (and challenges) especially for states to enhance their military power and change their status in the system of international relations. Nowadays, the U.S. still represent the main actor of this system, however, we can identify several rivals on the global or regional levels. People’s Republic of China (PRC) is one of these challengers. From this point of view, the development of autonomous systems (AxS) could strengthen the Chinese military capabilities and enhance the threat for the position of the U.S. and their allies (NATO). However, this presumption depends on the transformation of the Chinese strategic thinking that could address such opportunity. The aim of this paper is to analyse how the Chinese strategic thinking reflects the development of AxS and identify the changes which are connected with this issue. This paper will provide the necessary understanding of the PRC’s approach to the AxS, which, from this point of view, represents implications for military planning and strategy development not only of the U.S., but also NATO and its member states. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The client side detection of such type of attacks can be achieved by detecting Round Trip Time (RTT) deviations from multiple points on the Internet to the target network. However, the localization of the autonomous systems where the attack originates can only be performed with an underlying realistic and precise model of the Internet interconnections. A usable and useful realistic Internet interconnections model does not exist. The existing interconnection models are to simplistic to be applicable in real scenarios and/or incorporate to much uncorrelated information that cannot be used due to its complexity. This work presents a client side methodology to locate the source of BGP hijack attacks based on a quasi-realist graph that models the Internet as an all. The construction of such graph builds upon all known Internet exchange points (IX) and landing points of all known submarine cables. The lack of information about interconnections between Internet exchangers (IX) nodes and landing points is extrapolated from simple rules that take in consideration Earth geographic characteristics. This approach results in a graph that includes all major corner stones of the Internet while maintaining a simple structure. This underlying quasi-realist graph model of the Internet will allow the search for IX nodes where a false route could be injected to create a similar RTT anomaly observed during an attack. With very simplistic assumptions as similar node, link loads and symmetric routing by the shortest path, and calibration using a relatively small set of world-scale measurements, the proof-of-concept results show that the model allows to locate the source of routing hijack attacks within a reasonable degree of efficiency. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Moreover, it requires detailed specification of the external forces applied, such as vehicle speeds, loci, and axle weights.

However, demanding requirements ranging from high data rate and large user density to ultra-high reliability and low latency, are imposed on the 5G network, which is considered the key enabler of cooperative automated driving. In this paper, we propose a novel ultra-dense 5G vehicular network architecture, which features the kinematic information aided user-centric access, to address these requirements. In particular, distributed local access and application centers (LAACs) are designed to perform application implementation and access control collectively, such that the kinematic information of the vehicles extracted at the application layer can be exploited in the dynamic management of network resources to sustain consistently high-performance wireless communications between vehicles and their serving LAACs. Focusing on the uplink transmission of the periodic cooperative sensing messages (CSMs), the possible design of key elements in the kinematic information aided user-centric access, including access point association, radio resource allocation, and mobility support, are discussed. Issues brought about by the practical network deployment and constraints are also considered.

This threatens to undermine ocean best practice in marine monitoring, as it impedes a reduction in the bias and variance of sampled data and restricts the confidence in the advice that can be given. In particular, there is potential for confounding between the monitoring methods, their measured ecological properties, and the questions they seek to answer. Australia has developed significant long-term marine monitoring and observing programs and has one of the largest marine estates, including the world's largest representative network of marine parks. This new network will require ongoing monitoring and evaluation, beyond what direct funding can support, which needs to be integrated in a standardized way with other national programs to develop sufficient monitoring capacity. The aim of this paper is to describe the process undertaken in developing a suite of field manuals that provide Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for marine sampling in Australian waters so that data are comparable over time and space, thereby supporting a robust, cost-effective, and objective national monitoring program. We encourage readers to refer to the complete manuals of interest at www.nespmarine.edu.au/field-manuals. We generally limit SOP development to benthic or demersal sampling, (multibeam, autonomous underwater vehicles, baited remoted underwater video (BRUV), towed imagery, grabs and box corers, sleds and trawls), with a few exceptions (e.g., pelagic BRUVs). Collaboration was a key characteristic of our approach so rather than single groups trying to impose their standards, more than 70 individuals from over 30 organizations contributed to the first version of this field manual package. We also discuss the challenges that arose while developing these national SOPs, the associated solutions that were implemented, and the plans for ensuring their long-term maintenance and national and international uptake. We anticipate that this paper will contribute to international collaborations by evoking valuable suggestions and sharing of lessons learnt from other national initiatives so that we might work toward a global ocean best practice for biological and geoscientific monitoring of the marine environment. © 2019 Przeslawski, Foster, Monk, Barrett, Bouchet, Carroll, Langlois, Lucieer, Williams and Bax.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In particular, the tasks of underwater reconnaissance and surveillance, underwater mine hunting and anti-submarine warfare, all poses a serious and dangerous threat to humans. UUV has become the forerunning technology to accomplish such missions. In this paper, a method based on dynamic Bayesian network modeling was proposed to evaluate the UUV in an underwater threat situation. We divided the UUV threats into three categories: environmental factors, platform factors, and mission factors. Through each of these categories, we carried out factor extraction and set up the priori probability according to the characteristics. Setting up the static Bayesian network involved the addition of state transition probability and establishment of the model for assessing the dynamic Bayesian threat situation. By comparing the results of the static and dynamic Bayesian simulation, it was shown that the dynamic Bayesian is superior. Moreover, by analyzing the sensitivity, we recognized the greatest current threat and in response, determined the appropriate UUV countermeasures. The results showed that the dynamic Bayesian method has great practical significance and value for threat assessment. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Recent years have shown a strong increase of performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency with the aid of convolutional neural networks. Thus, the community has established data sets for benchmarking several kinds of algorithms. However, public data is rare for multi-sensor approaches or either not large enough to train very accurate algorithms. For this reason, we propose a method to generate multi-sensor data sets using realistic data augmentation based on conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN). cGANs have shown impressive results for image to image translation. We use this principle for sensor simulation. Hence, there is no need for expensive and complex 3D engines. Our method encodes ground truth data, e.g. semantics or object boxes that could be drawn randomly, in the conditional image to generate realistic consistent sensor data. Our method is proven for aerial object detection and semantic segmentation on visual data, such as 3D Lidar reconstruction using the ISPRS and DOTA data set.

By exploiting hybrid structured, TDLs, and polarized antenna arrays, the strict requirements of hardware size and cost on UAV can be satisfied. It is shown that the energy efficient beamforming with the adopted array can be formulated as a WMMSE-based parameter optimization problem, which however is still a challenging nonconvex problem due to unit modulus constraints in analog beamformer. To overcome the nonconvex nature, an iterative algorithm is proposed, in which the optimization problem is iteratively solved through three convex quadratic programming problems with convex equality or inequality constraints.

However, they are unable to meet large-scale and complex missions with a limited energy reserve. Only multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) work together to better cope with this problem and have been extensively studied. In this paper, a new systematic framework is proposed to solve the problem of multi-UAV collaborative task allocation. It is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and solved by the improved clustering algorithm. The purpose is to enable multi-UAV to complete tasks with lower energy consumption. As the number of UAVs rises, it also appears the flight safety issues such as collisions among the UAVs, an improved multi-UAV collision-resistant method based on the improved artificial potential field is proposed. Besides, the UAVs connected with the internet are vulnerable to the various type of network attacks, a method based on the intrusion detection system is proposed to resist the network attack during multi-UAV mission execution. We have also proposed an improved method to improve the accuracy of task allocation further. In addition, an online real-time path planning is proposed to enhance the robustness of multi-UAV to cope with sudden problems. Finally, the numerical simulations and real physical flying experiments showed that the proposed method could provide a viable solution for multi-UAV task allocation; moreover, compared with other task allocation methods, our method has great performance. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

"An Adaptive Tracking Estimator for Robust Vehicular Localization in Shadowing Areas","2019","IEEE Access","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907647","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064856330&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2907647&partnerID=40&md5=0fb500767eeac70f33c35e7f9783e201","The vehicular localization is a crucial technique in autonomous vehicle systems. This paper addresses an adaptive tracking method for robust vehicular localization even in shadowing conditions. The proposed tracking estimator consists of attitude estimation and position estimation. For the attitude estimation, the tracking estimator relies on inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a global positioning system (GPS). According to the shadowing condition, the presented estimator adaptively selects the IMU data and the GPS information in order to continuously estimate the vehicle attitude. Then, the tracking estimator utilizes the attitude estimates and the on-board diagnostics II (OBD-II) information in order to accurately estimate the vehicle position. The adaptive tracking approach allows robust vehicular localization since the vehicle attitude can reliably be achieved in shadowing and non-shadowing areas. Furthermore, the adaptive tracking method effectively exploits one extended Kalman filter for the estimations of vehicle attitude and position. This significantly alleviates the complexity of the tracking estimator. The simulation results verify that the adaptive tracking estimator accurately tracks the vehicle trajectory even in shadowing areas. The results also exhibit that the proposed tracking estimator outperforms the conventional tracking estimators in the aspects of localization performance. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The distribution of stresses and distortions with aerodynamic loads is studied. Factors such as tension, pressure and shear stress showed on wing of UAVs due to vibration which caused the structure of wing to break down and then failure. The experimental study was carried out by using wing made of composite material (foam and cover by lamination plate), where airfoil type (NACA Clark y) installed inside wind tunnel of low velocity. It is found that the vibration acceleration at constant wind velocity with variation of attack angle of the wing, it is obtained the relationship between the acceleration and the frequency using the LABVEIW program which analyzed and identified the distribution of forces on the wing.

However, existing methods assume an accurate knowledge of the location of the mobile unit and a precise propagation model of the actual radio environment. By getting rid of these two requirements, our proposed localization algorithms make mobility-assisted localization far more practical as we do not need to equip the mobile unit with a global positioning system or run a time-consuming campaign to survey radio environment. LEMOn estimates the position of target nodes by using known locations of a small set of fixed anchor nodes while receiving messages sent from a mobile unit from unknown arbitrary locations. LEMOn-M, on the other hand, solves the localization matching problem by mapping an arbitrary number of target nodes to the known set of locations. Both algorithms first estimate an inter-node distance using a similarity between received signal strength indicators of beacons received from the mobile unit. The conventional location estimators are then employed to localize target nodes with an unknown location. The obvious examples of real-world applications include but are not limited to unmanned aerial vehicle assisted wireless sensor networks and indoor IoT systems. The various simulations show that the two algorithms achieve a very high localization accuracy even in harsh radio environments while static localization techniques fail. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

By using a new performance function and an error transformation scheme, the proposed controller is able to achieve the desired tracking performance and the maximum convergence time is known as a priori. A disturbance observer is designed to deal with the influence of the modeling uncertainties, ocean disturbances, and thruster faults.

This has been confirmed by several research projects in which vehicles were attacked in order to trigger various functions. In some cases these functions were critical to operational safety. To make automotive systems more secure, concepts must be developed that take existing attacks into account. Several taxonomies were proposed to analyze and classify security attacks. However, in this paper we show that the existing taxonomies were not designed for application in the automotive development process and therefore do not provide enough degree of detail for supporting development phases such as threat analysis or security testing. In order to be able to use the information that security attacks can provide for the development of security concepts and for testing automotive systems, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy with degrees of detail which addresses these tasks.

To reduce the residual risk for unexpected DNN behaviour and provide evidence for their trustworthy operation, DNNs should be thoroughly tested. The DeepFault whitebox DNN testing approach presented in our paper addresses this challenge by employing suspiciousness measures inspired by fault localization to establish the hit spectrum of neurons and identify suspicious neurons whose weights have not been calibrated correctly and thus are considered responsible for inadequate DNN performance. DeepFault also uses a suspiciousness-guided algorithm to synthesize new inputs, from correctly classified inputs, that increase the activation values of suspicious neurons. Our empirical evaluation on several DNN instances trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets shows that DeepFault is effective in identifying suspicious neurons. Also, the inputs synthesized by DeepFault closely resemble the original inputs, exercise the identified suspicious neurons and are highly adversarial. © The Author(s) 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

For the majority of applications, clinical administration of Treg requires laborious ex vivo expansion and typically involves open handling for culture feeds and repetitive sampling. Here we show results from our approach to translate manual Treg manufacturing to the fully closed automated CliniMACS Prodigy® system reducing contamination risk, hands-on time, and quality variation from human intervention. Polyclonal Treg were isolated from total nucleated cells obtained through leukapheresis of healthy donors by CD8+ cell depletion and subsequent CD25high enrichment. Treg were expanded with the CliniMACS Prodigy® device using clinical-grade cell culture medium, rapamycin, IL-2, and αCD3/αCD28 beads for 13–14 days. We successfully integrated expansion bead removal and final formulation into the automated procedure, finalizing the process with a ready to use product for bedside transfusion. Automated Treg expansion was conducted in parallel to an established manual manufacturing process using G-Rex cell culture flasks. We could prove similar expansion kinetics leading to a cell yield of up to 2.12 × 109 cells with the CliniMACS Prodigy® and comparable product phenotype of >90% CD4+CD25highCD127lowFOXP3+ cells that had similar in vitro immunosuppressive function. Efficiency of expansion bead depletion was comparable to the CliniMACS® Plus system and the final ready-to-infuse product had phenotype stability and high vitality after overnight storage. We anticipate this newly developed closed system expansion approach to be a starting point for the development of enhanced throughput clinical scale Treg manufacture, and for safe automated generation of antigen-specific Treg grafted with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR Treg).

However, they are also collecting, storing, processing and transmitting data to eventually communicate them securely to third parties (e.g., owners of devices or cloud data storage). The deployed devices are often battery-powered mobile or static nodes equipped with sensors and/or actuators, and they communicate using wireless technologies. Examples include unmanned aerial vehicles, wireless sensor nodes, smart beacons, and wearable health objects. Such resource-constrained devices include Active Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) nodes, and these are used to illustrate our proposal. In most scenarios, these nodes are unattended in an adverse environment, so data confidentiality must be ensured from the sensing phase through to delivery to authorized entities: in other words, data must be securely stored and transmitted to prevent attack by active adversaries even if the nodes are captured. However, due to the scarce resources available to nodes in terms of energy, storage, and/or computation, the proposed security solution has to be lightweight. In this article, we propose a serverless protocol to enable Mobile Data Collectors (MDCs), such as drones, to securely collect data from mobile and static Active RFID nodes and then deliver them later to an authorized third party. The whole solution ensures data confidentiality at each step (from the sensing phase, before data collection by the MDC, once data have been collected by MDC, and during final delivery), while fulfilling the lightweight requirements for the resource-limited entities involved. To assess the suitability of the protocol against the performance requirements, it was implemented on the most resource-constrained devices to get the worst possible results. In addition, to prove the protocol fulfills the security requirements, it was analyzed using security games and also formally verified using the AVISPA and ProVerif tools. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Article","Final","Scopus"

For the shipping industry, research and development of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) has academic value and practical significance. In an unknown environment, MASS interacts with the environment to conduct behavioral decisions-making, intelligent collision avoidance, and path planning. Reinforcement learning balances exploration and exploitation to improve its own behavior by interacting with the environment to obtain rewarded data. Thus, to achieve intelligent collision avoidance and path planning for MASS in unknown environments, a path planning algorithm of MASS based on reinforcement learning is established. Firstly, the research status of unmanned ships and reinforcement learning is reviewed. The four basic elements of reinforcement learning are analyzed: environment model, incentive function, value function and strategy. Secondly, the port environment model, sensor model, MASS behavioral space, reward function, and action selection strategy were designed separately. Besides, the reward function consists of avoiding obstacles and approaching the target point. Finally, based on the python and pygame platform, a simulation experiment was carried out with Rizhao Harbor District as a case study to verify that this method has better self-adaptability. The model successfully avoids obstacles through online trial and error self-learning and plans adaptive paths in unknown environments. &#x00A9; 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Three survey studies presented participants with an artificial intelligence (AI) agent, an autonomous drone, or a human drone pilot facing a moral dilemma in a military context: to either launch a missile strike on a terrorist compound but risk the life of a child, or to cancel the strike to protect the child but risk a terrorist attack. Seventy-two percent of respondents were comfortable making moral judgments about the AI in this scenario and fifty-one percent were comfortable making moral judgments about the autonomous drone. These participants applied the same norms to the two artificial agents and the human drone pilot (more than 80% said that the agent should launch the missile). However, people ascribed different patterns of blame to humans and machines as a function of the agent’s decision of how to solve the dilemma. These differences in blame seem to stem from different assumptions about the agents’ embeddedness in social structures and the moral justifications those structures afford. Specifically, people less readily see artificial agents as embedded in social structures and, as a result, they explained and justified their actions differently. As artificial agents will (and already do) perform many actions with moral significance, we must heed such differences in justifications and blame and probe how they affect our interactions with those agents. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

UAVs are employed in various missions such as reconnaissance, observation, aggression, and protection. Consequently, counter-measures, known as anti-drone technologies, have been developed as well. In order to protect against threats from anti-drone technologies and enhance the survivability of UAVs, this study proposes an evasive measure. The proposed bio-inspired evasive maneuver of a UAV mimics a dragonfly's irregular flight. The unpredictable UAV movement is able to confuse enemies and avoid threats, thereby enhancing the UAV's survivability. The proposed system has been implemented on a commercial UAV platform (AR Drone 2.0) and tested in a real environment. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed flight pattern has larger displacement values compared to a regular flight maneuver, thus making the UAV's position is difficult to predict. © The Korea Institute of Information and Communication Engineering.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The results obtained at the simulation research stage were presented in the form of flight trajectory waveforms and changes occurring due to the strong wind. All obtained results were performed for two assumptions, namely windless and windy conditions. The wind strength in the analyzed system was treated as a disturbance of the UAV dynamics, which affected the change of the speed parameter and its position in the atmospheric space, as a consequence of which the flight stability was disturbed. Taking the above into consideration, it was assumed in the research that the obtained results should be carried out in a dynamic manner in order to realize the momentary dynamics of the motion of the tested flying object. The obtained results confirm that if we have accurate slip and angle of attack measurements for UAV, using electronic sensors we can correctly determine the value of the wind speed and the trajectory of the flight.

"Introducing Intelligence and Autonomy into Industrial Robots to Address Operations into Dangerous Area","2019","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","10.1007/978-3-030-14984-0_32","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064058277&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-14984-0_32&partnerID=40&md5=cec1492b6caf64f4b772dec49e76ccd1","The paper addresses the issue to use new generation robotic systems inside industrial facilities in order to complete operations in dangerous area. The new robotic systems are currently adopting the autonomous approach already in use in military sector; however, in this context the intensity of operations and the necessity to interact with high productivity systems introduce different challenges. Despite the problems, it is evident that this approach could provide very interesting improvements in terms of safety for humans especially in relations to dangerous area. For instance, in confined spaces, Oil & Gas or Hot Metal Industry these new autonomous systems could reduce the number of injures and casualties. In addition, these systems could increase the operation efficiency in this complex frameworks as well as the possibility to carry out inspections systematically; in this sense, this could result in improving the overall reliability, productivity and safety of the whole Industrial Plant. Therefore, it is important to consider that these systems could be used to address also security aspects such as access control, however they could result vulnerable to new threats such as the cyber ones and need to be properly designed in terms of single entities, algorithms, infrastructure and architecture. From this point of view, it is evident that Modeling and Simulation represent the main approach to design properly these new systems. In this paper, the authors present the use of autonomous systems introducing advanced capabilities supported by Artificial Intelligence to deal with complex operations in dangerous industrial frameworks. The proposed examples in oil and gas and hot metal industry confirm the potential of these systems and demonstrate as simulation supports their introduction in terms of engineering, testing, installation, ramp up and training. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles, sensors, humans, and infrastructure, thereby improving decision making based on the information received from its surroundings. However, for these applications to work correctly, information needs to be authenticated, verified and trustworthy. The most important messages in these networks are safety messages which are periodically broadcasted for various safety and traffic efficiency related applications such as collision avoidance, intersection warning, and traffic jam detection. However, the primary concern is guaranteeing the trustworthiness of the data in the presence of dishonest and misbehaving peers. Misbehavior detection is still in their infancy and requires a lot of effort to be integrated into the system. An attacker who is imitating “ghost vehicles” on the road, by broadcasting false position information in the safety messages, must be detected and revoked permanently from the VANETs. The goal of our work is analyzing safety messages and detecting false position information transmitted by the misbehaving nodes. In this paper, we use machine learning (ML) techniques on VeReMi dataset to detect the misbehavior. We demonstrated that the ML-based approach enables high-quality detection of modeled attack patterns. We believe that the ML-based approach is a feasible and effective way of detecting such misbehavior in a real-world scenario of VANETs. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The most frequent Aspergillus disorders include chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), a life-threatening disease that affects at least 3 million people worldwide, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), which affects approximately 4.8 million severe asthmatic patients globally. Diagnosis of such diseases involves IgG serological testing; however, the currently available anti-Aspergillus IgG detection assays are inappropriate for resource-poor laboratory settings, as they are expensive, rely on automated procedures, and require stable electrical power. Therefore, accurate CPA or ABPA diagnosis facilities are lacking in most low- and middle-income countries. We evaluated a novel anti-Aspergillus antibody immunochromatographic test (ICT) that requires minimal laboratory equipment. Two evaluations were performed: a single-center 4-month prospective study in a French reference laboratory (44 cases/257 patients) and a retrospective study in five French reference laboratories (262 cases and 188 controls). We estimated the ICT indices for the diagnosis of chronic aspergillosis, and the test results were compared to those of anti-Aspergillus IgG immunoblot (IB) assay. Of the 713 patients included in the study, 306 had chronic aspergillosis. Test sensitivity and specificity were 88.9% (95%CI[85–92]) and 96.3% (95%CI[94–98]) for the ICT and 93.1% (95%CI[90–96]) and 94.3% (95%CI[92–96]) for the IB, respectively. Agreement between the two assays was almost perfect (kappa = 0.86). As this ICT displays good diagnostic performance and complies with the ASSURED (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Equipment-free, and Delivered) criteria, we concluded that this anti-Aspergillus antibody ICT can be used to diagnose Aspergillus diseases in resource-poor settings. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

The approach is completely data-driven and unsupervised. It takes unlabeled sensor traces from several water monitoring missions and returns both a set of sparse drone state models and a clustering of data samples according to these models. We tested the methodology on a real dataset containing data of six different missions, two rivers and four lakes in different countries, for about 5.5 hours of navigation.

However, the wireless coverage of a single UAV is limited, and device-to-device (D2D) transmission can be exploited to accommodate more users with wireless service. Thus, in this paper, we consider the user association for a dual-UAV-enabled wireless network with the help of D2D connections in disasters. To achieve better performance, we maximize the weighted sum rate of the UAV-served users and the total number of D2D-connected users by optimizing the user association. The formulated problem is a combinatorial optimization problem involving binary variables, which is extremely difficult to solve. Accordingly, we propose two algorithms to solve it approximatively. The first algorithm is the learning-based clustering algorithm by viewing the optimization as a clustering problem. The users who can be served by the UAVs are regarded as cluster centers, which need to be selected optimally. In the second one, the binary variables are relaxed into continuous variables, and then, the problem can be solved by the existing optimization tools. The simulation results demonstrate that these two algorithms can achieve excellent suboptimal performance, and the computational complexity of the learning-based clustering algorithm is much lower. © 2019 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

These lesions present a wide range of aggressive phenotypes; it is also possible to encounter cases with various degrees of aggressiveness within the same lesion. Implementing an infrared-based approach for a more precise histological determination of the tumour aggressiveness should arouse interest among pathologists with direct benefits for patient care.

The new judgment criterion is a self-tuning parameter that is based on the quality of agent’s fitness instead of a random value used in the original WOA. The agent with higher fitness, i.e., superior agent, updates its position towards the best agent found so far. On the contrary, the agent with lower fitness, i.e., inferior agent, updates its position toward a reference agent which is selected randomly from the population. The performance of the proposed WOA is examined by testing six benchmark functions on low, medium, and high dimensions. Furthermore, the proposed WOA is applied to the path planning of unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV). The computed results of flight path and optimal cost obtained using the improved WOA will be compared with those obtained using the original WOA. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

It is an attempt to reduce these emissions and satisfy electricity demand. Its emerging potential is feasible by implementing microgrids. Higher cost and stochastic nature of intermittent RES are complications for the implementation and operation of such solutions. This paper analyzes economic feasibility and sustainability of implementation of hybrid power system (HPS) consisting of wind generator (WG), photovoltaic system (PVS), diesel generator unit and batteries as storage of energy. Technical analysis of the grid integration and parallel operation of the system and the grid are presented in the paper with an example of a real medium-voltage distribution network operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is shown that implementing such HPS would be beneficial in terms of economy, ecology, as well as in reducing energy losses. Besides, it will reduce power supplying costs and secure better exploitation and utilization of natural renewable energy sources. These technologies positively affect power network by decreasing the risk of network-components overloading, need for network expansions, better exploiting the power-generation facilities based on renewable resources and positively impacting voltage profiles. Moreover, it is shown that the microgrid can operate in island mode with autonomous power supply for consumers.

The growing use of card payments, hereafter referred to as credit cards, is evident in the daily use with many applications, such as withdrawing money from an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) and making payments in a store. Online payment has been very common these days, where the transaction is made across a great distance, allowing for online shopping. This has increased chance of credit cards experiencing a risk of cybersecurity attacks, particularly if the transaction amount is big enough. Another problem that arises is the potential fraud should a thief try to impersonate the credit card owner's identity. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a BioPay scheme that uses the fingerprint biotoken to replace the current plastic credit card. The BioPay scheme uses the biometric data (fingerprint), revocable fingerprint biotokens (Biotope), and Bipartite token to provide high authentication, non-repudiation, security and privacy for all payment transactions including money withdrawal from an ATM. The BioPay scheme collects biometric data (i.e. fingerprint) from users and embeds fourdigit authentication numbers inside the encoding biometric data (i.e. fingerprint), finally distributing them over clouds. In the payment/withdrawal process, a user provides his/her fingerprint to complete the transaction. BioPay scheme insures that the transaction process performs on an encrypted form to provide security and privacy for the customer's bank information. Our experiment shows that BioPay has comparable accuracy and significant performance gain for performing the transaction process. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Therefore, classifying ground vehicles from the UAV with high accuracy is of great significance. In order to avoid the complex feature extracting process and realize the classification of UAV-to-ground vehicles in different situations, this paper proposed a method based on micro-Doppler signatures using singular value decomposition (SVD) and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). First, models of UAV-to-ground vehicles are built to analyze the micro-Doppler components and Doppler signals in five different cases are given. Second, time-frequency spectrums of Doppler signals with low signal-to-noise ratios are improved after removing noise using SVD. Third, transfer-learning of pre-trained DCNNs is achieved using measured data and classification under various conditions is realized using the new-trained network. When there is no noise, the overall classification accuracy of two types of Doppler signals, three types of Doppler signals, four types of Doppler signals and five types of Doppler signals has reached 100%, 97%, 97%, and 96%, respectively. Comparison with current methods which need to extract micro-Doppler features by time-frequency techniques are also made.

Therefore, numerous systems based on Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) have been proposed to prevent this kind of accidents and enhance road users' safety. Nevertheless, these systems suffer from some problems, which can reduce their performance. For example, some of the proposed systems are autonomous; they do not exploit VANET to cooperate. In addition, as these systems offer more and more features, they treat a large amount of data, but without storage in a database. This can lead to the problems of congestion or loss of data. Therefore, we propose in this paper a new system, entitled Cooperative Road Hazard Detection Persistent System (CopRoadHazDPS). This system is based on the use of (i) Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-To-Infrastructure (V2I) communications to promote cooperation between vehicles, infrastructures and the Control Center, and (ii) Real-Time DataBases (RTDB) to manage data in real-time, effectively and accurately. It ensures the road safety in the case of unpredictable and predictable road hazards. Once a vehicle or the Control Center identifies a road hazard, its Road Manager cooperates with the other components to analyze the situation and decides about the convenient actions to avoid accidents. Simulations of several driving scenarios in varied type of roads, within the Vehicles In Network Simulation (VEINS) framework, confirm that CopRoadHazDPS ensures safety and reduces data freshness transactions thanks to the concept of the Quality of Data. © 2019, MIR Labs.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Many schemes have been developed to provide authentication mechanisms to ensure that only legitimate users are authorised to connect, but these schemes still suffer from vulnerable security. Various attacks expose patients' data for malicious tampering or destruction. Transferring health-related data and information between users and the health centre makes them exposed to penetration by adversaries as they may move through an insecure channel. In addition, previous mechanisms have suffered from the poor protection of users' authentication information. To ensure the protection of patients' information and data, we propose a scheme that authenticates users based on the information of both the device and the legitimate user. In this paper, we propose a Robust Authentication Model for Healthcare Users (RAMHU) that provides mutual authentication between the server and clients. This model utilizes an Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) and PHOTON to achieve strong security and good overall performance. RAMHU relies on multiple-pseudonym, physical address, and one-time password mechanisms to authenticate legitimate users. Moreover, extensive informal and formal security analysis with the automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool demonstrate that our model offers a high level of security in repelling a wide variety of possible attacks.

Intelligent battery management is a requirement for the success of these missions. We propose a formalization of the battery management problem in terms of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We model the problem as a POMDP where the agent modulates the energy provided to its propellers. The drone can estimate the “difficulty” to traverse an interval by observing the environment. An important aspect of this formalization is the prediction of future intervals’ difficulty values based on current observations by exploiting a priori geometric information, which we call Task Difficulty Propagation (TDP). We investigate variations of this approach and analyze related performance. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
"Operator Suspicion and Human-Machine Team Performance under Mission Scenarios of Unmanned Ground Vehicle Operation","2019","IEEE Access","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2901258","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063928895&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2901258&partnerID=40&md5=094a3753f1769677f244709a46588c1b","Emergent cyber-attack threats against cyber-physical systems can create potentially catastrophic impacts. The operators must intervene at the right moment when suspected attacks occur, without over-reliance on systems to detect the cyber-attacks. However, military operators are normally trained to trust, rather than suspect systems. We applied suspicion theory to explore how operators detect and respond to cyber-attacks against an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) system in the operational context of a human-machine team (HMT). We investigated the relationships between the operator suspicion and HMT performance by conducting human-in-the-loop experiments on eight mission scenarios with 32 air-force officers. The experiment yielded a significant, negative relationship between operator suspicion and HMT performance (quantified both in terms of the desirability of decision response and the time to respond). Notably, operator suspicion increased with the combined effects of cyber-attacks and a sentinel alert but not with the alert alone. This finding was particularly meaningful for 'false-negative' scenarios, in which no sentinel alert was sent despite cyber-attacks having occurred. Although the operators did not receive an alert, the operators grew more suspicious, seeking more information; it took longer for the operators to respond, and their decision responses were highly divergent (17.2% came with less-desirable responses, and 21.9% were considered instances of over-reliance). In contrast, in 'false-positive' scenarios, 95.3% of the operator responses were highly desirable. This experiment has implications for the role of a sentinel alert in engineering trustworthy HMT systems so that the operators can quickly transition through state-suspicion to the most desirable decision. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, it is essential to access a comprehensive annotated training set from different maritime environments. Creating such a dataset is expensive and time consuming. To automate this process, this paper proposes a novel self learning framework which automatically finetunes a generic pre-trained model to any new environment. With this, the framework enables automated labeling of new dataset types. The method first explores the video frames captured from a new target environment to generate the candidate vessel samples. Afterwards, it exploits a temporal filtering concept to verify the correctly generated candidates as new labels for learning, while removing the false positives. Finally, the system updates the vessel model using the provided self-learning dataset. Experimental results on our real-world evaluation dataset show that generalizing a finetuned Single Shot Detector to a new target domain using the proposed self-learning framework increases the average precision and the F1-score by 12% and 5%, respectively. Additionally, the proposed temporal filter reduced the noisy detections in a sensitive setting from 58% to only 5%. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we present a computationally low-cost and robust DATMO system which uses as input only 2D laser rangefinder (LRF) information. Due to its low requirements both in sensor needs and computation, our DATMO algorithm is meant to be used in current Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to improve their reliability for the cargo transportation tasks at port terminals, advancing towards the next generation of fully autonomous transportation vehicles. Our method follows a Detection plus Tracking paradigm. In the detection step we exploit the minimum information of 2D-LRFs by segmenting the elements of the scene in a model-free way and performing a fast object matching to pair segmented elements from two different scans. In this way, we easily recognize dynamic objects and thus reduce consistently by between two and five times the computational burden of the adjacent tracking method. We track the final dynamic objects with an improved Multiple-Hypothesis Tracking (MHT), to which special functions for filtering, confirming, holding, and deleting targets have been included. The full system is evaluated in simulated and real scenarios producing solid results. Specifically, a simulated port environment has been developed to gather realistic data of common autonomous transportation situations such as observing an intersection, joining vehicle platoons, and perceiving overtaking maneuvers. We use different sensor configurations to demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of our approach. We additionally evaluate our system with real data collected in a port terminal the Netherlands. We show that it is able to accomplish the vehicle following task successfully, obtaining a total system recall of more than 98% while running faster than 30 Hz. © 2018 by the authors.

The mission time is limited, and the most time-consuming operation is the collection of the objects themselves. Therefore, we address the problem to quickly identify the most valuable objects as surveillance planning with curvature-constrained trajectories. The problem is formulated as a multivehicle variant of the Dubins traveling salesman problem with neighborhoods (DTSPN). Based on the evaluation of existing approaches to the DTSPN, we propose to use unsupervised learning to find satisfiable solutions with low computational requirements. Moreover, the flexibility of unsupervised learning allows considering trajectory parametrization that better fits the motion constraints of the utilized hexacopters that are not limited by the minimal turning radius as the Dubins vehicle. We propose to use Bézier curves to exploit the maximal vehicle velocity and acceleration limits. Besides, we further generalize the proposed approach to 3D surveillance planning.

The case of unidirectional information flow is considered and the objective is to drive all the follower VTOL UAVs to accurately track a desired trajectory associated with a leader. Firstly, a novel distributed estimator is developed for each VTOL UAV to obtain the leader's desired information asymptotically. With the outputs of the estimators, the solution to the coordinated trajectory tracking problem of multiple VTOL UAVs is transformed to individually solving the tracking problem of each VTOL UAV. Due to the under-actuated nature of the VTOL UAV, a hierarchical framework is introduced for each VTOL UAV such that a command force and an applied torque are exploited in sequence, then the position tracking to the estimated desired position and the attitude tracking to the command attitude are achieved. Moreover, an auxiliary system with proper parameters is implemented to guarantee the singularity-free command attitude extraction and to obviate the use of the unavailable desired information. The stability analysis and simulations effectively validate the achievement of the coordinated trajectory tracking of multiple VTOL UAVs with the proposed control approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

The Yellow River is one of the main forces driving the geomorphological characteristics evolution of Kaifeng city. Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing system (UAVRSS) technology mean that research can now include both macroscopic and microscopic remotely sensed data. This paper utilized a digital elevation model (DEM) obtained using UAVRSS technology and evaluated the DEM and digital orthophoto map (DOM) of a given transect to analyze the geomorphological characteristics from the macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. Results of this research show that: the surface elevation near the Iron Pagoda is 88.44 m, the spire elevation is 143.618 m and the height is 55.183 m. The downstream area of the Yellow River in the Kaifeng city area is a typical suspended river. The surface elevation rises from 88.44m in Kaifeng city to 105 m near the Yellow River levee, while the elevation of the Yellow River is 92.25 m. The Yellow River is about 4 m above Kaifeng city and the river embankment is 16.56 m above the city. On a macro level, the transect elevation gradually decreases from north to south, which exhibits a stepwise pattern called the Four Typical Ladders. On a micro level, the most geomorphological changes were seen in the North Wall, the city-protection dike and the embankment. Those drastic changes were mainly influenced by the Yellow River floods, three major defense projects, and other human activities. The Yellow River remains the major of safety hazard to Kaifeng's steady and healthy development. Communities in Kaifeng city need to take a more active role in safeguarding their security and continuously aiding in flood control by recognizing the importance of major local defense projects. © 2019 Carpathian Journal of Earth and Environmental Sciences.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Our motivation is to improve driver experience using preview information from navigation maps. Smartphones facilitate, due to their unprecedented market penetration, the large-scale deployment of advanced driver assistance systems. On the other hand, it is challenging to exploit smartphone sensor data because of the fewer and lower quality signals, compared to the ones on board. Methods for detecting braking behavior using smartphones exist, however, most of them focus only on harsh events. Additionally, only a few studies correlate longitudinal driving behavior with the road condition. In this paper, a new method, based on deep neural networks and the sliding correlation coefficient, is proposed for the spatio-temporal correlation of road anomalies and driver behavior. A unique deep neural network structure, that requires minimum tuning, is proposed. Extensive field trials were conducted and vehicle motion was recorded using smartphones and a data acquisition system, comprising an inertial measurement unit and differential GPS. The proposed method was validated using the probabilistic Receiver Operating Characteristics method.

Our theoretical model views these delusions as unfounded threat beliefs which persist due to defence behaviours (e.g. avoidance) that prevent disconfirmatory evidence being processed. The treatment implications are that patients need to (1) go into feared situations and (2) not use defence behaviours. This enables relearning of safety and hence paranoia diminution. However, this is very difficult for patients due to their severe anxiety. A solution is to use virtual reality (VR) social situations, which are graded in difficulty and which patients find much easier to enter. We have now automated the provision of cognitive therapy within VR using an avatar coach, so that a therapist is not required and the treatment is scalable. In the THRIVE trial, the automated VR cognitive treatment will be tested against a VR control condition. It will contribute to our wider programme of work developing VR for patients with psychosis. Methods: Patients with persistent persecutory delusions in the context of non-affective psychosis will be randomised (1:1) to the automated VR cognitive treatment or VR mental relaxation (control condition). Each VR treatment will comprise approximately four sessions of 30 min. Standard care will remain as usual in both groups. Assessments will be carried out at 0, 2, 4 (post treatment), 8, 16, and 24 weeks by a researcher blind to treatment allocation. The primary outcome is degree of conviction in the persecutory delusion (primary endpoint 4 weeks). Effect sizes will be re-established by an interim analysis of 30 patients. If the interim effect size suggests that the treatment is worth pursuing (d > 0.1), then the trial will go on to test 90 patients in total. Secondary outcomes include real world distress, activity levels, suicidal ideation, and quality of life. Mediation will also be tested. All main analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle. The trial is funded by the Medical Research Council Developmental Pathway Funding Scheme. Discussion: The trial will provide the first test of automated cognitive therapy within VR for patients with psychosis. The treatment is potentially highly scalable for treatment services.

For this application, the availability of radiotracers labelled with positron emitters is a basic requirement. These short-lived neutron deficient positron emitters are produced at a cyclotron. In a cyclotron, charged particles are accelerated up to energies enabling to overcome Coulomb repulsion and induce nuclear reactions. The beam is extracted to target systems containing stable isotopes. Due to the bombardment, these stable isotopes are converted via nuclear reactions into radionuclides. The positron emitters are subsequently used for radiolabelling molecules to obtain radiotracers for various applications. Usually radiosyntheses are carried out in automated synthesis modules. The relatively short physical half-life of the positron emitters in use requires fast and efficient radiolabelling strategies that have been optimised for the most common radiopharmaceuticals in order to facilitate robust tracer production in sufficient activity amounts. Beside the PET alone approach, emerging methods deal with simultaneous PET-MR imaging to combine the high sensitivity of PET with the high resolution of MR. One possibility to exploit the synergy of both techniques is the combination of clinically established paramagnetic contrast agents and radiopharmaceuticals. This method was studied in several preclinical and clinical studies. A much more elegant possibility is the introduction of both modalities in one single, bimodal contrast and positron-emitting probe. Thus far, this technique was only tested in preclinical set-ups. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

But the security paradigm which can be an effect of faulty node, intrusion or even choice of erroneous communication channels needs to be taken care of through efficacious strategies. Consequently, both a specialized UAV mobility model and a security mechanism are required in order to establish prosperous collaborative networks. In this article, an SDN-based secure mobility model is proposed which takes into account the topological density and restricts the UAV and ground node (Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)) transmissions to authenticity. Significant gains are observed for throughput, coverage, and latency by establishing a simulated network between multiple UAVs and WSN motes. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Because of this, there are several threats which must be dealt with. One of these threats are the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) agents. In this framework, the development of technologies with the potential to increase the capabilities for detection of pollutants or toxic materials and situational awareness plays a significant role in the case of events in the scope of maritime accidents, pollution or port safety and security. These scenarios can pose substantial challenges to the operations, due to their complexity, and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is increasingly becoming ubiquitous in this context. This paper is focused in operation environment demonstrations, which aimed to validate the operational feasibility of the concept simulating two different scenarios; chemical and radiological. The selected scenarios were chosen on a risk probability analysis, being very approximate to a real-life incident. This system was tested, and the validation tests are also represented. It proved to be an asset in CBRN releases, either intentional or non-intentional. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The timely arrival of specialist ambulance crew in particular often makes the difference between life and death. As a consequence, it is critical that emergency ambulance services achieve short response times. This objective sets a considerable challenge to ambulance services worldwide, especially in metropolitan areas, where the density of incident occurrence and traffic congestion are high. Using London as a case study, in this paper, we consider the advantages and limitations of data-driven methods for ambulance routing and navigation. Our long-term aim is to enable considerable improvements to their operational efficiency through the automated generation of more effective response strategies and tactics. A key ingredient of our approach is to use a large historical dataset of incidents and ambulance location traces to model route selection and arrival times. Working on the London road network graph modified to reflect the differences between emergency and civilian vehicle traffic, we develop a methodology for the precise estimation of expected ambulance speed at the individual road segment level. We demonstrate how a model that exploits this information achieves best predictive performance by implicitly capturing route-specific persistent patterns in changing traffic conditions. We then present a predictive method that achieves a high route similarity score while minimising journey duration error. This is achieved through the combination of a technique that correctly predicts routes selected by the current LAS navigation system and our best performing speed estimation model. This hybrid approach outperforms alternative mobility models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first attempt to apply a data-driven methodology for route selection and the estimation of arrival times of ambulances travelling with blue lights and sirens on. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

These limitations include the requirement for active rather than passive monitoring, high equipment costs, sensor packaging size, and processing burden. We, therefore, propose a new structure from motion (SfM) 3-D ATR architecture that exploits the UAV's onboard sensors, i.e., the visual band camera, gyroscope, and accelerometer, and meets the requirements of a small UAV system. We tested the proposed 3-D SfM ATR using simulated UAV reconnaissance scenarios and found that the performance was better than classic 3-D light detection and ranging (LIDAR) ATR, combining the advantages of 3-D LIDAR ATR and passive 2-D ATR. The main advantages of the proposed architecture include the rapid processing, target pose invariance, small template size, passive scene sensing, and inexpensive equipment. We implemented the SfM module under two keypoint detection, description and matching schemes, with the 3-D ATR module exploiting several current techniques.

In addition to the flight environment for the fixed threat area, this paper tested the flight environment of the randomly generated threat area because of the complexity of the actual battlefield threat area. After many simulation tests, it was concluded that SMSOS can find the shortest flight path while avoiding the threat areas.

Then, by using the Robot Operating System (ROS) the mission control system was implemented in the single board computer inside the additional payload segment. Motion control for the AUV was realized designing controllers for surge speed, heading and depth. Design of the depth controller represented one of the major challenges mainly because towing the streamer heavily affects the vehicle dynamics when underwater. Thus, a specific fuzzy-PID control system was implemented and tested. This one, together with the surge speed and the heading controller are discussed in this paper.

Telecommunication service providers deploy UAVs to provide areal network access in remote rural areas, disaster-affected areas, or massive-attended events (sport venues, festivals, etc.), where full setup to provide temporary wireless coverage would be very expensive. Of course, a UAV is battery-powered with a limited energy budget for both mobility aspect and communication aspect. An efficient solution is to allow UAVs switching their radio modules to the sleep mode in order to extend the battery lifetime. This results in temporary unavailability of communication feature. Within such a situation, the ultimate deal for a UAV operator is to provide a cost-effective service with acceptable availability. This would allow meeting some target quality of service while having a good market share granting satisfactory benefits. In this article, we exhibit a new framework with many interesting insights into how to jointly define the availability and the access cost in UAV-empowered flying access networks to opportunistically cover a target geographical area. Yet, we construct a duopoly model to capture the adversarial behavior of service providers in terms of their pricing policies and their respective availability probabilities. Optimal periodic beaconing (advertising the presence of the UAV) is to be addressed, given the UAVs with limited battery capacity and their recharging constraints. A full analysis of the game, both in terms of equilibrium pricing and equilibrium availability, is derived. We show that the availability-pricing game exhibits some nice features as it is submodular with respect to the availability policy; whereas, it is supermodular with respect to the service fee. Furthermore, we implement a learning scheme using best response dynamics that allows operators to learn their joint pricing-availability strategies in a fast, accurate, and distributed fashion. Extensive simulations show convergence of the proposed scheme to the joint pricing-availability equilibrium and offer promising insights into how the game parameters should be chosen to efficiently control the duopoly game. © 2019 Sara Handouf and Essaid Sabir.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Human spaceflights represent a techno-logical challenge and the design and implementation of manned space habitats and work environment require knowledge and expertise to create habitats for mission scenarios that, for the future space missions, are not currently well known. The present International Space Station (ISS) is born on the experiences matured on the heritage of past space stations (Salyut, Skylab, Mir). The design solutions implemented on the ISS are therefore based on Human Factors Engineering (HFE) requirements developed from past experiences. From late eighties as of today, Thales Alenia Space in Italy has developed about fifty percent of the pressurized volume of the ISS, providing the permanent modules Node 2, Node 3, Cupola, Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM), Columbus and the logistic Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules (MPLM), Automated Transfer Vehicles (ATV), Cygnus. In all these modules Thales Alenia Space in Italy implemented HFE activities based on a human-centered design approach (driving the design, providing analysis, evaluation and usability verification of crew interfaces for work areas and equipment) aimed to guarantee a safe performance of all the on board crew operations, including displays and controls, workstation systems or evaluation of the entire spacecraft cabin or module habitable volume. The future of space exploration will passes through: (1) the extension of life of the ISS until 2024, exploiting it as test bench for future exploration missions and then as private and commercial orbital infrastructures; (2) the Chinese Space Station, that started its life in 2011 and will reach its full operability around 2022; (3) new commercial and independent stations in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and then from LEO to (4) Cislunar and deep space stations, including planetary outposts (Moon and Mars). This paper describes how the HFE activities have been performed for the ISS manned modules orbiting around the Earth and, thanks to the experience gained on the ISS, how they may be developed to physically and psychologically counteract the effects of a long stay period in space to suit future long duration spaceflights. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The application of pesticides by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can effectively avoid the harm caused by pesticides to human body, but the amount of pesticides is limited and it is difficult to locate the pesticides between flights. The unmanned navigation tractor with GNSS (global navigation satellite system) has realized the automatic navigation of planting and cotton harvesting in large area cotton field while could not work in cotton plant protection operation because the complex crop growth environment on site. Visual navigation vehicle can carry a large amount of pesticide, and its operation path is determined by the growth state of crops in the farmland avoiding crushing seedling. Therefore, it has great potential for the unmanned plant protection vehicle based on visual navigation in the field environment. Nowadays, sprayers mounted on tractors have being utilized in cotton protection in Xinjiang. The present studies for objects mainly focus on static images, and the dynamic detection of crop rows in video sequence is studied barely. Aiming at that, A plant protection unmanned vehicle was exploited, which can enhance and complement the intelligent agriculture. After the vehicle finish spraying in one cotton row, it will stop safely and accurately just at the edge of the proposed position. Subsequently, its 4 wheels will rotate 90° simultaneously, so as to ensure it can move in a vertical direction through the cotton rows; a camera on the opposite side can also be utilized to count the cotton rows and avoid repeated spraying. When the vehicle passes cotton rows preseted, its 4 wheels can simultaneously rotate 90°again along the same direction to prepare for the next spraying. Then a video-based dynamic count method for cotton rows is proposed to determine the interval distance of linear operation area in this paper. By tracking the centroids of cotton plant, the number of cotton rows could be counted in real time. Firstly, the color image from video became grayscale to emphasize information of cotton rows with prominent green component by calculation of 2G-R-B. Then, a region of interest (ROI) was set not only to reduce the calculation amount, but also to avoid the lacking of seedling in the end of cotton rows. Secondly, the vertical cumulative histogram of gray in ROI was solved and the histogram vs ROI width curve was obtained. The wave crests of the curve determined by two conditions were found, in which the width and the sharpness should be satisfied with threshold. Then a floating window was established to positioning the cotton row. Besides that, the grayscale centroids of each floating window were calculated, which represent the cotton rows where each one was located. Thirdly, a target window with the size of 65×65 was established for each centroid. With the growth of cotton, the branches and leaves intertwined in which situation, the gap between the 2 cotton rows became smaller, and the cotton leaves of one row were very loose. In this case, one cotton row might correspond to more than one target window. To avoiding the influences of the growth, the overlap rate was calculated between each 2 adjacent target windows. And the 2 target windows whose overlap rate meeting the condition (large than 0.1) should be merged together. It had been done until no overlapped rate meeting the conditions. Thus, each cotton row had been identified. For tracking, starting from the second frame, the overlap rate between each target window and other target windows from previous frame was judged, if it met the condition, the two target windows in the two successive frames were connected. Then the cotton row could be tracked.

"A Generic Spatiotemporal UAV Scheduling Framework for Multi-Event Applications","2019","IEEE Access","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885321","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058633929&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2018.2885321&partnerID=40&md5=2ac9edd20ee9d2fc8af8fa5f8de278ee","In this paper, a generic scheduling framework to manage a fleet of micro unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed. The objective is to employ multiple UAVs in sequential and parallel ways to cover spatially and temporally distributed events in a geographical area of interest over a long period of time. The proactive scheduling framework considers several constraints and challenges, including the technical specifications of the UAVs and the limited battery capacities. In addition, the platform considers the necessity to regularly send back the UAVs to a docking station for battery recharging. A mixed integer nonlinear programming problem aiming at minimizing the total energy consumption and the number of employed UAVs is formulated to guarantee the non-redundant exploitation of the resources. Afterward, a series of linearization steps are introduced to convert the problem into a mixed integer linear programming one so that it can be optimally solved. To reduce the complexity of the problem, a dynamic time horizon discretization approach adapted to the characteristics of the problem is performed beforehand. The proposed UAV scheduling framework is formulated in a generic manner and can be applied in multiple domains comprising short- and/or long-term UAV missions while ensuring uninterrupted service. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"Utility of broad-range 16S rRNA PCR assay versus conventional methods for laboratory diagnosis of bacterial endophthalmitis in a tertiary care hospital","2019","British Journal of Ophthalmology","10.1136/bjophthalmol-2018-312877","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054850121&doi=10.1136%2fbjophthalmol-2018-312877&partnerID=40&md5=b9326553dab64b9554e9b7098f19a77b","Background Endophthalmitis, a sight-threatening intraocular infection, can be of postsurgical, post-traumatic or endogenous origin. Laboratory diagnosis-based appropriate therapy can be vision-saving. Conventional culture-based laboratory diagnosis takes time and lacks sensitivity. In this study a broad-range PCR assay was assessed against conventional and automated culture methods in vitreous specimens for accurate microbiological diagnosis. Aims To use broad-range PCR assay targeting 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) region of bacteria and to assess its performance vis-à-vis conventional and automated culture methods in the laboratory diagnosis of endophthalmitis. Methods Vitreous specimens from 195 patients with clinically diagnosed endophthalmitis were processed for classical and automated culture methods, antimicrobial sensitivity and broad-range PCR assay targeting 762 bp region of 16S rRNA followed by nucleotide sequencing by Sanger's method. Causative agents were identified from the nucleotide sequences analysed against the GenBank database, and organisms were identified using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) MM18A guidelines. Results Bacteria could be detected from 127 (65.13%) of the 195 vitreous specimens by broad-range PCR assay; bacterial isolation was possible from 17 (8.7%) and 60 (30.76%) of these specimens by conventional and automated culture methods, respectively (p<0.0001). PCR assay could detect two uncultured bacterium, and in five cases the bacterial identity could not be determined from NCBI database matching. Conclusion Broad-range PCR assay could provide definitive microbial diagnosis within 24 hours in significantly more patients (p<0.0001). Some rare organisms could be detected, useful in treatment modalities. Automated culture was significantly more sensitive than conventional culture. © 2019 Article author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

Actually, the combined use of nadir and oblique UAV photogrammetry allows to cross the bridge between close range and aerial photogrammetry, enabling the quick acquisition of images for detailed 3D model production. This paper assesses the accuracy of UAV photogrammetry in the reconstruction of a cultural heritage building, namely the Girifalco fortress (Cortona, Italy), and it evaluates advantages and issues of this kind of 3D model generation. Furthermore, this work aims also at investigating the possible use of the generated model in order to extract geometric information about the building. First, elementary geometric shapes are extracted from the photogrammetric point cloud: the results of this step can be exploited for enabling the automatic generation of compact models of the building, which can be useful for instance in 3D city modeling applications. Then, a proper analysis of the geometric information included in the extracted shapes can be used in order to extract semantic information (e.g. to classify windows and doors) and to detect damaged areas on the building walls. © Authors 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To make motion planning models able to learn from the environment and to deal with emergency situations, a new motion planning framework called as parallel planning is proposed in this paper. In order to generate sufficient and various training samples, artificial traffic scenes are firstly constructed based on the knowledge from the reality. A deep planning model which combines a convolutional neural network CNN with the Long Short-Term Memory module LSTM is developed to make planning decisions in an end-to-end mode. This model can learn from both real and artificial traffic scenes and imitate the driving style of human drivers. Moreover, a parallel deep reinforcement learning approach is also presented to improve the robustness of planning model and reduce the error rate. To handle emergency situations, a hybrid generative model including a variational auto-encoder VAE and a generative adversarial network GAN is utilized to learn from virtual emergencies generated in artificial traffic scenes. While an autonomous vehicle is moving, the hybrid generative model generates multiple video clips in parallel, which correspond to different potential emergency scenarios. Simultaneously, the deep planning model makes planning decisions for both virtual and current real scenes. The final planning decision is determined by analysis of real observations. Leveraging the parallel planning approach, the planner is able to make rational decisions without heavy calculation burden when an emergency occurs. © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This coupled with recent advances in image processing and deep learning opens new possibilities for promising quantitative techniques. The clinical translation of quantitative imaging was previously hampered by tedious non-scalable and subjective image analysis. Osteoarthritis (OA) diagnosis using X-rays can be automated by the use of deep learning models and pilot studies showed feasibility of using similar techniques to reliably segment multiple musculoskeletal tissues and detect and stage the severity of morphological abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Automation and more advanced feature extraction techniques have applications on larger more heterogeneous samples. Analyses based on voxel based relaxometry have shown local patterns in relaxation time elevations and local correlations with outcome variables. Bone cartilage interactions are also enhanced by the analysis of three-dimensional bone morphology and the potential for the assessment of metabolic activity with simultaneous Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/MR systems. Novel techniques in image processing and deep learning are augmenting imaging to be a source of quantitative and reliable data and new multidimensional analytics allow us to exploit the interactions of data from various sources.

Fish species in these aquatic systems are prone to such pollution incidents and act as important indicators of the pollution level. Because cadmium enters the systematic circulation of fish and is non-biodegradable, the investigation of cadmium accumulation in fish bodies provides insights into the detrimental effects of cadmium pollution on the aquatic biological system. This research aims to validate the eco-environmental risks associated with emergent cadmium pollution incidents based on the investigation of the different tissues and organs of diverse fish species. The investigation was conducted six times along the Longjiang River using sampling methods during which all fish species were also classified and analyzed based on the water layer they reside in and their feeding habits. The results show that the cadmium concentration in the fish tissues is significantly higher in the former three investigations compared with that of the latter three analyses. For herbivorous, carnivorous, and omnivorous fish species, the cadmium concentration of their different tissues and organs follows the order: kidney>liver>gut>gill>egg>scale≈muscle. The cadmium concentration in the kidney is significantly higher (P<0.05) than that in any other organs of the fish species. This agrees with the fact that the kidney intensively metabolizes and accumulates heavy metals. The cadmium concentration in the same tissues or organs of the fish species living in different water layers follows the trend: demersal fish species>middle lower-layer species>middle upper-layer species. The sequence of the cadmium bioaccumulation factors in the muscles of different fish species is omnivore>carnivorous>herbivorous, that is, 8.32, 6.33, and 5.15, respectively, while the bioaccumulation factors in the muscles of the fish species in different water layers decrease in the following sequence: demersal fish species (8.18)>middle bottom-layer fish species (7.70)>middle upper-layer fish species (4.99). These experimental results indicate the biomagnification effects in heavy metal-polluted aquatic environments, where the bioaccumulation of heavy metals by fish is related to both the overall pollution level and local residential environment. © 2019, Science Press.

Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby creating a highly dynamic and heterogeneously managed ad-hoc network. It is these network properties that make it a challenging task to protect integrity of the data and guarantee its correctness. A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like public key infrastructure (PKI)-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security. We derive and discuss a classification for misbehavior detection mechanisms, provide an in-depth overview of seminal papers on the topic, and highlight open issues and possible future research trends. © 2018 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to study the deployment of source address validation-filtering by using some special path backscatter messages that are generated by the spoofed traffic. We use the long term absence of such messages from an Autonomous System (AS) to classify it as non-spoofer AS. We use Caida's backscatter dataset for our study. We provide the list of spoofer and non-spoofer ASes from the given dataset. We also provide detailed mathematical analysis for calculating the amount of time we need to wait before declaring an AS as a non-spoofer. Besides, we use the normal approximation of binomial distribution to calculate confidence interval for the proportion of ASes allowing spoofing and to test the hypothesis regarding the spoofing activity in the Internet. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The proposed method is based on a tightly coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that exploits the spatial diversity of measurements coming from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers and a vision system, which are integrated with inertial and magnetic sensor data. The focus is set on outdoor environments and the innovative idea is to extend attitude estimation approaches based on multiple GNSS antennas, to a multi-vehicle system where differential-GNSS and vision-based UAV-to-UAV tracking are exploited to build a virtual additional navigation sensor. Concept and processing architecture are described with emphasis on the EKF measurement update phase which is applicable for any number of cooperating deputies, and for different GNSS processing architectures. Performance of the proposed method is assessed through experimental tests involving two multi-rotors and two fixed ground antennas, one of which is used as Ground Control Point for pointing accuracy analysis.

While declarative languages (of the kind found in automated planners and model checkers) are traditionally used for verifying AI systems, a big challenge is to design methods that generate verified executable programs. A good example of such a “verification to implementation” cycle is given by automated planning languages like PDDL, where plans are found via a model search in a declarative language, but then interpreted or compiled into executable code in an imperative language. In this paper, we show that this method can itself be verified. We present a formal framework and a prototype Agda implementation that represent PDDL plans as executable functions that inhabit types that are given by formulae describing planning problems.

Bi, Cd, Tl, Se, Sb, Te and Au are the most enriched metals and metalloids in the particulate phase of volcanic plumes. Observations of the particulate phase from the volcanic plumes of White Island, Yasur and Etna reveal abundant silicates and sulfates, sulfuric acid and more interestingly Zn oxide containing variable amounts of Cu. Thermodynamic speciation calculations show chloride species to be very important in terms of gaseous metal transport. Complexation with sulfur, in contrast, appears significant only in S-rich and Cl-poor gases, at high (>700 °C) temperature. Bromine, despite being a minor component of volcanic gases, is very efficient at complexing with metals, and especially with Cu, Pb, Bi, Zn and Cr. Metal emission rates in the study period at White Island are one to two orders of magnitude lower than reported previously, with ~6–10 kg/d of Cu, As, Se and Zn, and <2 kg/d of Pb, Bi, Tl, Sb, Te and Cd. Higher values were measured at Yasur volcano, ranging from ~175 kg/d of Cu, ~30 kg/d of As, Zn and Pb, and ~3 kg/d of Tl and Cd.

We compare our new data to previously reported metal emissions from volcanoes worldwide, and show that high halogen emissions appear as the critical parameter controlling metal emissions, explaining the high metal fluxes measured at some intraplate volcanoes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The aim is to explore to what extent the policies fostered by Turin’s municipality within the European project NOVELOG (New Cooperative Business Models and Guidance for Sustainable City Logistics) could trigger more ecological behaviors in retailers during the provision’s process. The model is based on the idea that ecological behavior depends both on economic and social features, such as imitative component and service’s quality perceived and individual environmental sensitivity. The agents are informed through real data provided by the City of Turin. A price-based policy simulates the effect of an hypothetical NOVELOG monetary incentive, while a motivation-based policy would exploit the network effect. The results show that the policies improve the timing of the diffusion of virtuous behaviors, reducing the total production of pollutant emissions. The most effective results are given by strong monetary incentives for purchasing an ecological vehicle within the own-account option, or by the combination of price and motivation policies for the shift to a third-party option. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive and repeatable technique to diagnose brain abnormalities. However, the analysis of EEG spectra is still carried out manually by experts and effective computer science methods to extract relevant information from these signals become a necessity. Through a data mining approach, which guides the automated knowledge discovery process, we aim to achieve an automatic patients classification from the EEG biomedical signals of AD and MCI, in order to support medical doctors in the diagnosis formulation. Specifically, we design an integrated procedure that encompasses the following steps: (1) data collection; (2) data preprocessing of EEG-signals data; (3) features extraction by applying time-frequency transforms on EEG-signals (Fourier and Wavelet analysis); and (3) a supervised learning approach to classify samples in patients suffering from AD, patients affected by MCI, and healthy control (HC) subjects. By applying our procedure, we are able to extract human-interpretable classification models that allow to automatically assign the patients into their belonging class. In particular, by exploiting a Wavelet feature extraction we achieve 83%, 92%, and 79% of accuracy when dealing with HC vs AD, HC vs MCI, and MCI vs AD classification problems, respectively. By comparing the classification performances with both feature extraction methods, we find out that Wavelets analysis outperforms Fourier. Thus, we suggest it in combination with supervised methods for automatic patients classification based on their EEG signals for aiding the medical diagnosis of dementia.

"UAVs for volcano monitoring: A new approach applied on an active lava flow on Mt. Etna (Italy), during the 27 February–02 March 2017 eruption","2019","Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2018.12.001","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058162398&doi=10.1016%2fj.jvolgeores.2018.12.001&partnerID=40&md5=8aae0c87e25f339ffa889fea3beb35f6","Mt. Etna (Italy) with 55 effusive events in the last six years is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, with a million people living on its flank and thousands of tourists who visit it every summer. For this reason, the lava flow monitoring for risk mitigation and Civil Protection purposes is one of the fundamental tasks of the Cartographic Laboratory of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Osservatorio Etneo. This activity was traditionally performed using data collected from the field (with terrestrial GPS surveys) and from helicopter taking visible and thermal images. During the 27 February–02 March 2017 eruption the FlyEye Team, applied Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to monitor the active lava flow. Two high-resolution UAV surveys were performed on the lava flow field on the south flank of Mt. Etna, between 3050 and 2600 m a.s.l., obtaining almost 1170 images. Structure-from-Motion techniques were applied to create orthophotos and Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of the lava flow field and surroundings. The obtained DEM has a resolution of 14.2, and 20.7 cm/px for the main lava flow and the west branch, respectively. On the wall, the 96% of the lava flow field was mapped using aerial images by UAV covering an area of 0.3 × 106 m2. Lava flow volume was calculated with the topographic approach: difference between post- and pre-eruption surface, DEM 2017 and DEM 2014, respectively. The impossibility of spreading the GCPs homogenously distorted the resulting DEM; for this reason, it was necessary to align the lava flow point clouds, obtained from the photogrammetry software, to the basal 2014 DEM. Subtracting the two DEMs a lava flow thickness grid resulted leading to a total volume of 1.4 × 106 m3 and an error estimation of about 20%. Finally, dividing the total volume for the effusion duration (63 h) a mean output rate of 6.2 m3/s resulted. The calculated volcanological parameters have the same order of magnitude of the previous activity of Mt. Etna, between 2011 and 2016. This research demonstrates that UAV photogrammetry was successfully exploited during an eruptive crisis, allowing a first fast processing, to obtain an orthophoto of the lava flow field, useful for “decision makers” and a further slower processing for the realization of a high-resolution DEM. The latter makes it possible to update the topography, another important argument for Civil Protection purpose.

This makes the design of valve train components a complex task. Typically, IC engine valves are subjected to varying stresses throughout an engine cycle. This can result in fatigue failure of valves in many applications where the supplier was deficient in advanced analysis methodologies. Considering this fact, a new technique for valve durability and life predictions has been developed using various approaches such as internal semi-empirical thermal boundary conditions calculation tool, Multibody Dynamics (MBD) and Finite Element Modelling (FEM). In this study, a bi-metallic (Stem - X45 CrSi 9 3 and Head - X50 CrMnNiNbN 21 9) exhaust valve operating under direct attack valvetrain of 1.2L inline 3-cylinder gasoline engine has been considered. Internal semi-empirical tool and literature work on gas flow has been used to predict the thermal boundary (gas side temperatures and HTCs at various locations) conditions. The predicted thermal BCs are then used to predict the temperature distribution and thermal stresses in the valve. An MBD model of the direct attack type valvetrain has been built using the Ricardo VALDYN software tool to predict the valve seating and peak lift deceleration loadings. A FEM approach has then been used to predict the stresses at various events such as 1. Firing 2. Seating and 3. Valve deceleration and the fatigue durability and life. To reduce the total iteration time and study various valve designs quickly, a script has been written which runs all the analyses sequentially and gives fatigue safety and life values at the end. The safety factor predicted in this study provides a good correlation with test data. The new design proposed after FEA calculations has an improved fatigue safety factor. © 2019 SAE International.

Deontological arguments based on putative legal compliance failures and the creation of accountability gaps along with wide consequentialist arguments based on factors like the ease of engaging in wars have been leveraged by a number of different states and organizations to try and reach global consensus on a ban of LAWS. This paper will focus on one strand of deontological arguments-ones based on human dignity. Merely asserting that LAWS pose a threat to human dignity would be question begging. Independent evidence based on a morally relevant distinction between humans and LAWS is needed. There are at least four reasons to think that the capacity for emotion cannot be a morally relevant distinction. First, if the concept of human dignity is given a subjective definition, whether or not lethal force is administered by humans or LAWS seems to be irrelevant. Second, it is far from clear that human combatants either have the relevant capacity for emotion or that the capacity is exercised in the relevant circumstances. Third, the capacity for emotion can actually be an impediment to the exercising of a combatant's ability to treat an enemy respectfully. Fourth, there is strong inductive evidence to believe that any capacity, when sufficiently well described, can be carried out by artificially intelligent programs. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

For successful operation, it is critical to maintain the security and privacy of the communication messages exchanged among such vehicles. One important aspect of this is to maintain the location privacy of vehicles/users that use unencrypted basic safety messages (BSM) to exchange information with nearby vehicles. The use of temporary identifiers called pseudonyms have been proposed for protecting location privacy. A pseudonym change strategy (PCS) determines the conditions under which pseudonyms should change. The goal is to change pseudonyms in a way that prevents an attacker from linking multiple pseudonyms to the same vehicle. In this paper we explore how an intelligent attacker placement scheme can impact the success rate for linking pseudonyms. We propose a new speed-based attacker placement algorithm that can be used to evaluate different PCS. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme is able to increase the rate for successfully linking vehicle pseudonyms. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

For safety purposes, it is essential the V2X technology would support communication between all road users, e.g., Vehicles (V2V), pedestrians (V2P) and road infrastructure (V2I). Hence, the efficiency of a V2V communication solution should be evaluated through system level performance. In addition, the examined performance metrics need to reflect safety related properties. Metrics as Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) and transmission latencies, which are commonly used to assess V2X system's functionality, aren't enough since reception latencies are overlooked. The latter is crucial in ensuring messages would reach their destination on time to avoid hazardous incidents. The reception cadence may be much lower than this of the transmission due to various phenomenon (e.g. channel congestion). Still, whether this pose a safety's threat depends on mechanical aspects such as the distance between vehicles or their relative speed. In this paper, we present a metric called CD-PRR (Cadence Dependent PRR) - a generalization of the PRR metric which considers the reception cadence the system should support per range. Thus, providing better understanding of the system's reception latencies. Metric's performance is presented for several scenarios using Dedicated Short-Range communication (DSRC) technology and based on the results some conclusions are drawn. CD-PRR is an example of automotive related metrics. We propose that based on the automotive needs a specific metrics set would be designed and applied for the V2X safety messages. © 2019 General Motors LLC.

Quantum-behaved pigeon-inspired optimization (QPIO) has been widely applied to such nonlinear problems. However, conventional QPIO is suffering low global convergence speed and local optimum. In order to solve the above problems, an improved QPIO algorithm, adaptive operator QPIO, is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a new initialization process based on logistic mapping method is introduced to generate the initial population of the pigeon-swarm. After that, to improve the performance of the map and compass operation, the factor parameter will be adaptively updated in each iteration, which can balance the ability between global and local search. In the final landmark operation, the gradual decreasing pigeon population-updating strategy is introduced to prevent premature convergence and local optimum. Finally, the demonstration of the proposed algorithm on UAV path planning problem is presented, and the comparison result indicates that the performance of our algorithm is better than that of particle swarm optimization (PSO), pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO), and its variants, in terms of convergence and accuracy. © 2018 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Invaded vehicles may cause severe damage and casualties; thus, it is essential to stop these vehicles to prevent traffic accidents and terrorist attacks. To improve traffic safety, an active collision algorithm based on trajectory planning is therefore proposed. The algorithm can be used to cause autonomous vehicles to collide with invaded vehicles at intersections. Several types of trajectory planning algorithms have been proposed for autonomous vehicles in recent years. However, a few of these algorithms consider active collisions with other vehicles. The main advantage and novelty of the proposed method are that it can be utilised to plan a suitable trajectory for active collision with invaded vehicles at intersections. This capability has rarely been discussed in the literature to date. The main contributions of this study are that the problem of active collision of autonomous vehicles at intersections is discussed and an effective active collision algorithm based on trajectory planning is proposed.

Errors or unavailability of resources to determine this, poses a serious threat not only to the vehicle but also the environment around it. Global Positioning System (GPS) is one of the most common resources to determine position about the reference geographic coordinate system. But this resource has several drawbacks of its own viz. clock errors, multi-path errors and also uncertainty of good signal strength due to weather conditions or physical barriers. Also an additional drawback of a low-update rate makes it unreliable for the Autonomous Localization algorithm to operate on this. Thus a system is required which has no external environment dependencies to determine the position of the vehicle. Inertial Measurement Unit is a coupled system comprising of a 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope which records body force accelerations and the yaw rate. The sensor is loosely coupled with GPS system using Kalman Filter to predict and update vehicle position even at the event of loss of GPS signal. Extended research has been carried out in this discipline using different system architecture and methodologies. The novelty of this work lies in the simplicity and the methodology involved in combining two Kalman Filters, each for each sensor in a cascading manner resulting in the improvement of accuracy compared to a stand-alone GPS system. © 2019 SAE International.

The aerodynamic forces and flow field around the wings vary dramatically with the unsteady motion parameters (reduced frequency, mean angle of attack, and amplitude). This study conducts numerical simulations to investigate the influence of such parameters on the aerodynamic characteristics of a pitching NACA 0012 airfoil. The respective cases are researched through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on the finite-volume method (FVM). The governing equations are the unsteady, incompressible two-dimensional Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations. The airfoil performs sinusoidal pitching oscillations with respect to the quarter chord at the Reynolds number 2.53×105. A detailed analysis of the force coefficients and how their evolution is affected by the dynamics of flow structures generated during pitch oscillations is presented. The results show that these parameters change the instantaneous force coefficients quantitatively and qualitatively. The effective angle of attack is different at various locations of the airfoil chord during the oscillation motion, which determines the deviations of forces at the same angle of attack during pitch-up and pitch-down periods. It is also observed that the strength, interaction, and convection of the vortex surrounding the airfoil are significantly affected by the variations of these parameters. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To additionally exploit the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of fluorescence imaging for improved surgical guidance, a PSMA-I&T-based hybrid tracer, PSMA-I&F (DOTAGA-k(Sulfo-Cy5)-y-nal-k-Sub-KuE), has been developed and evaluated. Methods: The in vitro PSMA-targeting efficiency of PSMA-I&F, the reference PSMA-I&T, and their corresponding                             nat                             Ga-/                             68                             Ga- and                             nat                             Lu/                             177                             Lu counterparts was determined in LNCaP cells via competitive binding assays (IC                             50                             ) and dual-tracer radioligand and fluorescence internalization studies. Biodistribution and small-animal PET imaging studies were performed in CB17 SCID and LNCaP xenograft-bearing SHO mice, respectively, and complemented by intraoperative far-red fluorescence imaging using a clinical laparoscope. Additionally, fully automated serial cryosectioning and fluorescence imaging of 1 tumor-bearing animal as well as PSMA immunohistochemistry and fluorescence microscopy of organ cryosections (tumor, kidney, spleen) were also performed. Results: Compared with the parent PSMA-I&T analogs, the PSMA affinities of PSMA-I&F and its                             nat                             Ga-/                             nat                             Lu-complexes remained high and unaffected by dye conjugation (7.9, IC                             50                              , 10.5 nM for all ligands). The same was observed for the internalization of                             68                             Ga- and                             177                             Lu-PSMA-I&F. In vivo, blood clearance of                             68                             Ga- and                             177                             Lu-PSMA-I&F was only slightly delayed by high plasma protein binding (94%-95%), and very low accumulation in nontarget organs was observed already at 1 h after injection. Dynamic PET imaging confirmed PSMA-specific (as demonstrated by coinjection of 2-PMPA) uptake into the LNCaP xenograft (4.5% ± 1.8 percentage injected dose per gram) and the kidneys (106% ± 23 percentage injected dose per gram). Tumor-to-background ratios of 2.1, 5.2, 9.6, and 9.6 for blood, liver, intestines, and muscle, respectively, at 1 h after injection led to excellent imaging contrast in                             68                             Ga-PSMA-I&F PET and in intraoperative fluorescence imaging. Furthermore, fluorescence imaging of tissue cryosections allowed high-resolution visualization of intraorgan PSMA-I&F distribution in vivo and its correlation with PSMA expression as determined by immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: Thus, with its high PSMA-targeting efficiency and favorable pharmacokinetic profile,                             68                             Ga/                             177                             Lu-PSMA-I&F serves as an excellent proof-of-concept compound for the general feasibility of PSMA-I&T-based hybrid imaging. The PSMA-I&T scaffold represents a versatile PSMA-targeted lead structure, allowing relatively straightforward adaptation to the different structural requirements of dedicated nuclear or hybrid imaging agents.

Automated MI identification techniques aid in early detection, thus ensuring timely medication and prevention. The vector-cardiogram (VCG) proves to be a more informative and low dimensional alternative for the 12 lead Electrocardiogram (ECG). The automated VCG analysis tools, reported till date, utilize a large number of features based on the sizes, area and orientation of the QRS and the T loops. Such features are not only difficult to extract but also suffers from the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel VCG feature - the volume ratio of the 3-d QRS and the ST-T loop, which combines both the loop morphologies into a single feature. Statistical analysis of this feature extracted from the PTB diagnostic ECG database reveals that it is significantly different for the healthy and infarction data and provides a MI detection sensitivity of 98.8%.

Methods This is a retrospective chart review with prospective follow-up of adult patients treated with FCRT for primary ONSM at four academic medical centres between 1995 and 2007 with ≥10 years of follow-up after treatment. Results 16 patients were identified with a mean post-treatment follow-up of 14.6 years (range: 10.5-20.7 years). The mean age at symptom onset was 47.6 years (range: 36-60 years). FCRT was performed at a mean of 2.3 years after symptom onset (range: 0.2-14.0 years). At last follow-up, visual acuity had improved or stabilised in 14 of the 16 (88%) patients, and 11 (69%) had retained or achieved ≥20/40. The mean deviation on automated perimetry remained stable (-14.5 dB pretreatment vs-12.2 dB at last follow-up; p=0.68, n=10). Two (11%) patients had persistent pain, proptosis or diplopia, compared with six (38%) pretreatment (p=0.11). Two (13%) patients developed radiation retinopathy more than 6 months after completion of therapy, one (50%) of whom had worse visual acuity compared with pretreatment. No patient developed tumour involvement or radiation damage in the fellow eye. Conclusion FCRT stabilises or improves visual function in patients with primary ONSM and is associated with a low risk of significant ocular sequelae. This treatment should be considered instead of surgery in patients with primary ONSM who require intervention due to loss of visual sensory and/or ocular motor function. © 2019 Author(s).","Review","Final","Scopus"

This mode of transportation has recently been adopted as a means of transportation in a pioneering initiative by Dubai with more smart cities expected to adopt this mode of transportation shortly as it is believed to show potentials to transform urban transportation and future mobility in smart cities. The concern, however, is, the security of these systems and the smart city infrastructure they depend on for their operations. Certainly, the introduction of AAVs into smart cities raises many new cybersecurity questions that are in need of investigation and answers. It is, therefore, the purpose of this paper to explore potential cyber-physical security threats and the challenges that need to be confronted before this mode of transportation is fully integrated into the smart cities. A methodology to investigate on a large scale the cybersecurity attack vectors of such systems is presented based on four categories of systems that are critical to AAV operations, as well as their impacts and how to counter such attacks. What follows is a summary of the countermeasures that should be implemented to guarantee the safety of those systems. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Technological advancements have drastically changed the structure and organization of the healthcare industry. McKinsey Global Institute estimates that 800 million workers worldwide could be replaced by robots by the year 2030. There is already a robotic revolution happening in healthcare wherein robots have made tasks and procedures more efficient and safer. Locsin and Ito has addressed the threat to nursing practice with human nurses being replaced by humanoid robots. Routine nursing care dictated solely by prescribed procedures and accomplishment of nursing tasks would be best performed by machines. With the future practice of nursing in a technologically advanced future transcending the implementation of nursing actions to achieve predictable outcomes, how can human nurses remain relevant as practitioners of nursing? Nurses should be involved in deciding which aspects of their practice can be delegated to technology. Nurses should oversee the introduction of automated technology and artificial intelligence ensuring their practice to be more about the universal aspects of human care continuing under a novel system.

The rapid diffusion of NIPT, as well as the ease and simplicity of the test raises concerns around informed decision-making and the potential for routinization. Introducing NIPT in a way that facilitates informed and autonomous decisions is imperative to the ethical application of this technology. We approach this imperative by systematically reviewing and synthesizing primary qualitative research on women's experiences with and preferences for informed decision-making around NIPT. Methods: We searched multiple bibliographic databases including Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and ISI Web of Science Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). Our review was guided by integrative qualitative meta-synthesis, and we used a staged coding process similar to that of grounded theory to conduct our analysis. Results: Thirty empirical primary qualitative research studies were eligible for inclusion. Women preferred to learn about NIPT from their clinicians, but they expressed dissatisfaction with the quality and quantity of information provided during counselling and often sought information from a variety of other sources. Women generally had a good understanding of test characteristics, and the factors of accuracy, physical risk, and test timing were the critical information elements that they used to make informed decisions around NIPT. Women often described NIPT as easy or just another blood test, highlighting threats to informed decision-making such as routinization or a pressure to test. Conclusions: Women's unique circumstances modulate the information that they value and require most in the context of making an informed decision. Widened availability of trustworthy information about NIPT as well as careful attention to the facilitation of counselling may help facilitate informed decision-making.

With cooperative decision making and control, the cooperative combat of the UCAV formation are described and the mathematical model of the UCAV formation is built. Then, the task assignment model of the UCAV formation is developed according to flight characteristics of the UCAV formation and constraints in battlefield. The cooperative task assignment problem is solved using the improved particle swarm optimization(IPSO), ant colony algorithm(ACA) and genetic algorithm(GA) respectively. The comparative analysis is conducted in the aspects of the precision and the search speed. The path planning model of the UCAV formation is constructed considering the oil cost, threat cost, crash cost and time cost. The cooperative path planning problem is solved based on the evolution algorithm(EA), in which unique coding scheme of chromosomes is designed, and the crossover operator and mutation operator are redefined. Simulation results demonstrate that the UCAV formation can choose the best algorithm according to the real battlefield environment, which can solve the cooperative task assignment and path planning problems quickly and effectively to meet the demand of the cooperative combat. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Proper investigation of the abnormalities in heart sounds is known to provide vital clinical information that can assist in the diagnosis and management of cardiac conditions. However, despite significant advances in the development of algorithms for automated classification and analysis of heart sounds, the validity of different approaches has not been systematically reviewed. This paper provides an in-depth systematic review and critical analysis of all the existing approaches for automatic identification and classification of the heart sounds. All statements on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2009 Checklist were followed and addressed thoroughly to maintain the quality of the accounted systematic review. Out of 1347 research articles available in the academic databases from 1963 to 2018, 117 peer-reviewed articles were found to fall under the search and selection criteria of this paper. Amongst them: 53 articles are focused on segmentation, 72 of the studies are related to the feature extraction approaches and 88 to classification, and 56 reported on the databases and heart sounds acquisition. From this review, it is clear that, although a lot of research has been done in the field of automated analysis, there is still some work to be done to develop robust methods for identification and classification of various events in the cardiac cycle so that this could be effectively used to improve the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases in combination with the wearable mobile technologies. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this regard, players can generate their actions to achieve Nash equilibrium only by measuring their own payoff values, which means that the players do not need any information about the details of payoff function or other players’ actions. Additionally, in contrast to the most classical extremum seeking algorithms, this algorithm can converge to Nash equilibria without steady state oscillation and faster, because the amplitude of excitation sinusoidal signal in the conventional extremum seeking is adjusted to converge to zero, so the deleterious effects of steady state oscillation will be eliminated. Moreover, since each player can possess a dynamic, the actions are filtered before applying to the payoff function, which can make this algorithm appealing to many applications such as mobile sensor networks. In addition, the details of convergence to Nash equilibria are provided. Finally, we illustrate the application of this algorithm to solve the formation control problem of non-holonomic unicycles, and evasion of jammer attacks on unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs), which clearly shows the effectiveness and superiority of this algorithm through simulation results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Based on the established AHRS measuring model and the attack model, we have decomposed the optimal Kalman estimate into a linear combination of local state estimates. We then propose a convex optimization-based approach, instead of the weighted sum approach, to combine the local estimate into a more secure estimate.

We have developed a new instrument for trace-concentration measurements of VOCs and intermediate-volatility compounds of up to 14 carbon atoms in a fully automated (computer-free), independent, low-cost, compact GC-based system for the quantitative analysis of complex mixtures without the need for compressed, high-purity gases or expensive detectors. Through adsorptive analyte preconcentration, vacuum GC, photoionization detectors, and need-based water-vapor control, we enable sensitive and selective measurements with picogram-level limits of detection (i.e., under 15 ppt in a 4 L sample for most compounds). We validate performance against a commercial pressurized GC, including resolving challenging isomers of similar volatility, such as ethylbenzene and m/p-xylene. We employ vacuum GC across the whole column with filtered air as a carrier gas, producing long-term system stability and performance over a wide range of analytes. Through theory and experiments, we present variations in analyte diffusivities in the mobile phase, analyte elution temperatures, optimal linear velocities, and separation-plate heights with vacuum GC in air at different pressures, and we optimize our instrument to exploit these differences. At 2-6 psia, the molecular diffusion coefficients are 6.4-2.1 times larger and the elution temperatures are 39-92 °C lower than with pressurized GC with helium (at 30 psig) depending on the molecular structure, and we find a wide range of optimal linear velocities (up to 60 cm s                             -1                             ) that are faster with broader tolerances than with pressurized-N                             2                              GC.                          © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It is emerging as one of the threats to the economy. It has become very important to detect CAD in its early stage which can help society in a broader way by saving a significant number of lives. The proposed method is a novel efficient automated approach which is capable of detecting CAD among the large group of patients using Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The system design provides a complete model of pre-processing of ECG, finding the heart rate which is further decomposed up to 4 level sub-bands using analytic transformation based signal decomposition method. The signal decomposition method is used to analyze the low frequency components of the signal and to deal with non stationary nature of heart signals. Two Non-linear entropy estimators as K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and Correlation entropy are applied to decomposed sub- bands obtained after applying Analytic wavelet transformation based flexible decomposition technique to extract non-linear dynamics. The clinical significant features from the large data set can be selected by employing wilcoxon ranking method which assigns ranks on the applied signal. Further, an entropy-based classification approach and a suitable classifier namely Linear support vector machine (L-SVM) is used to classify among CAD and normal class. The algorithm is simulated in MATLAB and it is found that the results matched closely with the available data. This computer-assisted automated system which characterizes the heart signal can serve as an aid for the cardiologists in their daily screening of a large number of patients and can be used in primary health care centers which help the physicians in the early detection of a CAD. © 2019 MECS.","Article","Final","Scopus"

They are particularly challenging when the anatomy or pathology is small, as in retinal images (e.g. vasculature branches or microaneurysm lesions) and cardiac MRI, or when the image is of low quality due to device acquisition parameters as in magnetic resonance (MR) scanners. We propose an image super-resolution method using progressive generative adversarial networks (P-GANs) that can take as input a low-resolution image and generate a high resolution image of desired scaling factor. The super resolved images can be used for more accurate detection of landmarks and pathologies. Our primary contribution is in proposing a multi-stage model where the output image quality of one stage is progressively improved in the next stage by using a triplet loss function. The triplet loss enables stepwise image quality improvement by using the output of the previous stage as the baseline. This facilitates generation of super resolved images of high scaling factor while maintaining good image quality. Experimental results for image super-resolution show that our proposed multi stage P-GAN outperforms competing methods and baseline GANs. The super resolved images when used for landmark and pathology detection result in accuracy levels close to those obtained when using the original high resolution images. We also demonstrate our methods effectiveness on magnetic resonance (MR) images, thus establishing its broader applicability © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

Up to now, ADF research mainly focuses on increased traffic safety, driver comfort, and road capacity. Studies on emissions are lacking. By taking the driver out-of-the-loop, cycle-to-cycle variability is removed and energy losses and large accelerations can be significantly reduced. This enhances emission performance robustness, which will allow for more fuel-efficient engine settings. A general, optimal control framework is introduced, which integrates ADF with energy and emission management. Based on predictions of the vehicle power demand and emissions, a desired vehicle velocity profile, which minimizes the overall vehicle energy consumption, is determined. In this approach, real-world tailpipe emissions are explicitly taken into account. This opens the route to emission trading on vehicle or even, on platoon, fleet, and traffic level. For the combined ADF and powertrain development, testing, and certification, various opportunities are presented to fully exploit the synergy between these systems and to reduce development time and costs. By equipping vehicles with an emission monitoring system, real-world data of the ADF emission reduction potential becomes available. As validated traffic and component aging models are lacking, this data is also valuable for realistic scenario development and uncertainty modeling in virtual or mixed testing. This will lead to improved robustness evaluation and performance. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"

But these networks also become vulnerable if proper security mechanisms are not put into place. The prime motive behind taking up this project was to try and contribute in the development of such security protocol so that no one can illegally interfere with these networks. Many different security authentication protocols have been made previously but they suffer from one or the other disadvantage. After detailed and thorough reading and analysis of these protocols and their shortcomings, effort has been made to devise a better protocol from these existing ones.Further, the proposed scheme has been simulated using the widely used ""Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications"" (AVISPA) tool. It makes sure that the protocol is safe from the active and passive attacks and also prevents the replay, man-in-the-middle attacks and various other kinds of attacks.

Emerging studies convincingly demonstrate that proper functioning of the CTS is vital for all living forms. Dysregulation of CTS leads to multitude of pathologies, naming the few, such as metabolic, immune, and sleep disorders, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Therefore, there is a growing interest to exploit circadian clocks as a therapeutic target. Efforts are made to identify the small molecules with potential to modulate the functional state of disrupted circadian clock.

The system operates on a tracking by detection principle and can track multiple pedestrians in complex urban traffic situations. By using a behavioral motion model and a non-parametric distribution as state model, we are able to accurately track unpredictable pedestrian motion in the presence of heavy occlusion. Tracking is performed independently, on the image and ground plane, in global, motion compensated coordinates. We employ Camera and LiDAR data fusion to solve the association problem where the optimal solution is found by matching 2D and 3D detections to tracks using a joint log-likelihood observation model. Each 2D–3D particle filter then updates their state from associated observations and a behavioral motion model. Each particle moves independently following the pedestrian motion parameters which we learned offline from an annotated training dataset. Temporal stability of the state variables is achieved by modeling each track as a Markov Decision Process with probabilistic state transition properties. A novel track management system then handles high level actions such as track creation, deletion and interaction. Using a probabilistic track score the track manager can cull false and ambiguous detections while updating tracks with detections from actual pedestrians. Our system is implemented on a GPU and exploits the massively parallelizable nature of particle filters. Due to the Markovian nature of our track representation, the system achieves real-time performance operating with a minimal memory footprint. Exhaustive and independent evaluation of our tracker was performed by the KITTI benchmark server, where it was tested against a wide variety of unknown pedestrian tracking situations. On this realistic benchmark, we outperform all published pedestrian trackers in a multitude of tracking metrics. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The revision of the surveillance definition to ventilator-associated event (VAE) has been mandated in adult populations, to overcome these issues. However, the evidence for application of the definition is unknown in children. Objectives: To review the evidence on the application of the new VAE surveillance definition in paediatric population and examine the potential challenges in clinical practice. Review methods: A systematic approach was used to locate and synthesise the relevant paediatric literature. Studies were appraised according to epidemiological appraisal instrument (EAI) and the grades of evidence in the National Health Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines. Results: Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Quality of study methods was above 50% on the EAI. The overall grade of evidence was assessed as C (satisfactory). The incidence of VAE in children ranged from 1.1 to 20.9 per 1000 ventilator days as a result of variations in surveillance criteria across included studies. There is little agreement between the new VAE and PNU/VAP surveillance definition in the identification of VAP. Challenges in the application of VAE surveillance were related to; the difference in modes of ventilation used in children versus adults, inconclusive criteria tailored to paediatric samples and a lack of data that support for automatic data extraction applied in paediatric studies. Conclusion: This review demonstrated promising evidence using the new VAE surveillance definition to define the VAE in children, but the level of the evidence is low. Before the possibility of real implementation in clinical settings, challenges related to VAE paediatric specific criteria’ and the value of automated data collection need to be considered. © 2018 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd","Review","Final","Scopus"

Firstly, problem is converted to a part of Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), and then the solutions are optimized with the 2-Opt approach and other simple algorithms. The code is implemented in MATLAB by using its visualization. Circular avoidance approach is developed and applied with the Simulated Annealing in order to escape from circular radar threats. Tests have been made to observe the results of SA algorithm and radar threats avoidance approaches, where the results show that after a period of time, SA algorithm gives acceptable solutions with the capacities of escaping from radar area threats. Where SA algorithm gives better solutions in less period of time when there are no radar threats.

Marine applications include persistent sensing and refueling Underwater Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs). A WEC array is an attractive solution for marine energy grids where scalability is important, since evolving load requirements can be accommodated by adding or removing WECs from the array. The design space for a WEC array has many variables including inter-WEC spacing, individual WEC output capacity, WEC type, array geometry and the control approach[l]. Hydrodynamic decoupled analyses facilitate decentralized control, but miss a potential opportunity to exploit the hydrodynamic coupling of a more tightly packed array [2] [3]. A compact array model, parameterized with a non-dimensional WEC packing ratio, was proposed by Garnaud and Mei [1]. This paper extends those results to include the hydrodynamic coupling between individual WECs in the array showing an increase in the theoretical energy extraction.This work considers a 25-WEC, compact array example. The hydrodynamic radiation coefficients were generated using WAMIT (Wave Analysis MIT) and were incorporated into the dynamic equations introduced by Garnaud and Mei. An energy extraction efficiency metric, considering the energy dissipated due to the waves reflected by and transmitted through the array, was used to quantity the effect of the added terms. Incorporation of the hydrodynamic terms showed an increase of up to 28% in the low frequency range.

Performance metrics, such as the expected time of completion and the level of confidence that all mine-like objects within the area have been detected, are used to quantity the utility of the operation. The AUVs coordinate their individual search segments in a distributed manner in order to maximize the global utility. The segmentation is optimized by the Compression-DPOP (C-DPOP) algorithm, which allows explicit reasoning by the AUVs about their actions based on the performance metrics.

MPTCP is a drop-in replacement for TCP. This makes MPTCP an attractive choice for various applications. In recent times, MPTCP is finding its way into constrained devices such as robots and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). For these devices, it is critical to provide better Quality of Service (QoS) to control data than user data. In this paper, we have presented Primary Path only Scheduler (PPos), a novel sub-flow scheduler, for constraint devices such as UAV s and robots where it is efficient to segregate data on different links based upon type of data or QoS requirements to improve reliability and error resilience. We have proposed a new MPTCP kernel data-structures and algorithm to make the sub-flow priority persistent across sub-flow failures. We have introduced several new socket APIs to control the sub-flow properties of MPTCP at the application layer and also for providing the fine grained control over the behaviour of PPoS. These APIs can help modifying the MPTCP behaviour for each socket/application individually rather than changing the behaviour system wide.

High-Definition (HD) maps with accurate road marking information are very useful for many applications ranging from road maintenance, improving navigation, and prediction of upcoming road situations within AVs. This paper presents a deep learning-based framework for road marking extraction, classification and completion from three-dimensional (3D) mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds. Compared with existing road marking extraction methods, which are mostly based on intensity thresholds, our method is less sensitive to data quality. We added the step of road marking completion to further optimize the results. At the extraction stage, a modified U-net model was used to segment road marking pixels to overcome the intensity variation, low contrast and other issues. At the classification stage, a hierarchical classification method by integrating multi-scale clustering with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) was developed to classify different types of road markings with considerable differences. At the completion stage, a method based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) was developed to complete small-size road markings first, then followed by completing broken lane lines and adding missing markings using a context-based method. In addition, we built a point cloud road marking dataset to train the deep network model and evaluate our method. The dataset contains urban road and highway MLS data and underground parking lot data acquired by our own assembled backpacked laser scanning system. Our experimental results obtained using the point clouds of different scenes demonstrated that our method is very promising for road marking extraction, classification and completion. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

This has created the problem of keeping unauthorized UAVs away from private or sensitive areas where they can be a personal or public threat. This paper proposes an improved radio frequency (RF)-based method to detect UAVs. The clutter (interference) is eliminated using a background filtering method. Then singular value decomposition (SVD) and average filtering are used to reduce the noise and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Spectrum accumulation (SA) and statistical fingerprint analysis (SFA) are employed to provide two frequency estimates. These estimates are used to determine if a UAV is present in the detection environment. The data size is reduced using a region of interest (ROI), and this improves the system efficiency and improves azimuth estimation accuracy. Detection results are obtained using real UAV RF signals obtained experimentally which show that the proposed method is more effective than other well-known detection algorithms. The recognition rate with this method is close to 100% within a distance of 2.4 km and greater than 90% within a distance of 3 km. Further, multiple UAVs can be detected accurately using the proposed method. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Article","Final","Scopus"

When pedestrians interact with a vehicle, they follow specific motion patterns based on their intentions. This work presents a conditional generative adversarial network based architecture that explicitly model human intention as a conditional variable to robustly learn the multi-modal nature of pedestrian motion for accurate future trajectory prediction. The generator in our framework uses a LSTM encoder-decoder conditioned on human intention for motion prediction while the discriminator consisting of a LSTM classifier learns to distinguish whether a predicted trajectory is consistent with a given intention. Through experiments on two real-world datasets, it demonstrates that our proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the average displacement error of predicted positions. Additionally, qualitative analysis shows that our model is capable of predicting a multi-modal distribution with respect to human intentions. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, challenges exist in the temporal analysis of this data, specifically in conducting change-detection analysis on the high-quality point cloud data. These files are very large in size and contain points in varying locations that do not align between scenes. These large file sizes also limit the use of this data for individuals with low computational resources, such as first responders or forward-deployed soldiers. In response, this manuscript presents an approach that aggregates data spatially into voxels to provide the user with a lightweight, web-based exploitation system coupled with a flexible backend database. The system creates a robust set of tools to analyze large temporal stacks of 3D data and reduces data size by 78%, all while being able to query the original point cloud data.

Moreover, categorizing NC (Normal Control), MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and AD early in course allows the patients to experience benefits from new treatments. Therefore, it is important to construct a reliable classification technique to discriminate the patients with or without AD from the bio medical imaging modality. Hence, we developed a novel FCM based Weighted Probabilistic Neural Network (FWPNN) classification algorithm and analyzed the brain images related to structural MRI modality for better discrimination of class labels. Initially our proposed framework begins with brain image normalization stage. In this stage, ROI regions related to Hippo-Campus (HC) and Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) from the brain images are extracted using Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) method. Subsequently, nineteen highly relevant AD related features are selected through Multiple-criterion feature selection method. At last, our novel FWPNN classification algorithm is imposed to remove suspicious samples from the training data with an end goal to enhance the classification performance. This newly developed classification algorithm combines both the goodness of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The experimental validation is carried out with the ADNI subset and then to the Bordex-3 city dataset. Our proposed classification approach achieves an accuracy of about 98.63%, 95.4%, 96.4% in terms of classification with AD vs NC, MCI vs NC and AD vs MCI.

The increasing use of autonomous UAVs inside buildings and around human-made structures demands new accurate and comprehensive representation of their operation environments. Most of the 3D scene abstraction methods use invariant feature point matching, nevertheless some sparse 3D point clouds do not concisely represent the structure of the environment. The presented approach is based on observation and representation models using the straight line segments. The goal of the work is a complete method based on the matching of lines, that provides a complementary approach to state-of-the-art methods when facing 3D scene representation of poor texture environments for future autonomous UAV. Oppositely to other recently published methods obtaining 3D line abstractions, the proposed method features 3D segment abstraction in the absence of a previously generated point based reconstruction. Another advantage is the ability to group the resulting 3D lines according to different planes, for exploiting coplanar line intersections. These intersections are used like feature points in the reconstruction process. It has been proved that this method exclusively based on lines can obtain spatial information in the adverse situations when a SIFT-like SfM pipeline fails to generate a dense point cloud. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

This problem is particularly challenging as it requires the car to jointly reason about multiple pedestrians in a scenario where every one cooperates with each other to avoid collisions. To model the interactions among them, we propose a socially-aware graph convolutional network (SAGCN) which solves this problem in a graph learning framework. An attention graph is first built where each of its node carries the pedestrian temporal information and its edge represents the correspondence between pairwise pedestrians. To extract the temporal features, we implement temporal convolutional network (TCN) on each node. By utilization of relative motion between pairwise pedestrians, another TCN is employed to learn the correspondence of them which is formulated to an adjacency matrix of the attention graph. With the learned temporal features and adjacency matrix, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is exploited to aggregate the node information and jointly predict future trajectories of multiple pedestrians. Through experiments in several publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that our model effectively learns the comprehensive spatial-temporal representation and outperforms state-of-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The broadly accepted colony formation assay (CFA) directly measures a cell's ability to divide; however, it takes weeks to perform and is incompatible with high-throughput screening (HTS) technologies. Here, we describe the MicroColonyChip, which exploits microwell array technology to create an array of colonies. Unlike the CFA, where visible colonies are counted by eye, using fluorescence microscopy, microcolonies can be analyzed in days rather than weeks. Using automated analysis of microcolony size distributions, the MicroColonyChip achieves comparable sensitivity to the CFA (and greater sensitivity than the 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide [XTT] assay).

The aim of this paper is to review the overall state of the art of advances within these topics in paediatrics and to evaluate their potential application for monitoring in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Approach: For this purpose, more than 150 papers dealing with video and audio processing were reviewed. For both topics, clinical applications are described according to the considered cohorts - full-term newborns, infants and toddlers or preterm newborns. Then, processing methods are presented, in terms of data acquisition, feature extraction and characterization. Main results: The paper first focuses on the exploitation of video recordings; these began to be automatically processed in the 2000s and we show that they have mainly been used to characterize infant motion. Other applications, including respiration and heart rate estimation and facial analysis, are also presented. Audio processing is then reviewed, with a focus on the analysis of crying. The first studies in this field focused on induced-pain cries and the newest ones deal with spontaneous cries; the analyses are mainly based on frequency features. Then, some papers dealing with non-cry signals are also discussed. Significance: Finally, we show that even if recent improvements in digital video and signal processing allow for increased automation of processing, the context of the NICU makes a fully automated analysis of long recordings problematic.

Such spacecraft will travel much faster, with speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light, to realize extrasolar exploration in a human lifetime. However, existing navigation technologies are not up to the task because they are generally Earth-based, exploiting the Deep Space Network for tracking. They lack the resolution to estimate the state of a high-speed spacecraft in the interstellar medium, and the long light-travel times likely preclude sharing state information with the spacecraft for active trajectory control. Moreover, all rely on reference-frame-independent physical laws and treat relativistic effects as perturbations of classical theories of orbital mechanics. Given the unprecedented uncertainty that interstellar environment can introduce in the trajectory of such a spacecraft, on-board navigation is likely the only feasible approach. This paper describes autonomous navigation for spacecraft traveling at relativistic speeds. The special theory of relativity is central to its flight-dynamics model. The proposed method assumes that the spacecraft has access to a state-of-the-art star catalog describing the relative positions and colors of a number of stars and can detect relative directions and apparent colors of the corresponding stars onboard with a star tracker and a spectrometer. By relating the motion of the spacecraft to these observations in the spacecraft's reference frame, the algorithm estimates its instantaneous position and velocity. The paper includes the results of simulations of the linearized equations for a spacecraft having a generic star tracker and a spectrometer as a sensor, traveling from Earth to Proxima Centauri at 20 percent of the speed of light. Results show that the algorithm can estimate the position and velocity of the spacecraft with less than 0.5 percent error. Assuming the key relativistic effects are apparent in the sensors, this approach provides a universal navigation algorithm that can be used by any space vehicle traveling at arbitrarily high speed. This work represents an enabling step toward relativistic spaceflight. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, the broadcast and line-of-sight nature of air-To-ground wireless channels give rise to a new challenge on how to realize secure UAV communications with the destined nodes on the ground. This paper aims to tackle this challenge by applying the physical layer security technique. We consider both the downlink and uplink UAV communications with a ground node, namely, UAV-To-ground (U2G) and ground-To-UAV (G2U) communications, respectively, subject to a potential eavesdropper on the ground. In contrast to the existing literature on the wireless physical layer security only with the ground nodes at fixed or quasi-static locations, we exploit the high mobility of the UAV to proactively establish favorable and degraded channels for the legitimate and eavesdropping links, through its trajectory design. We formulate new problems to maximize the average secrecy rates of the U2G and G2U transmissions, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, and the transmit power of the legitimate transmitter over a given flight period of the UAV. Although the formulated problems are non-convex, we propose iterative algorithms to solve them efficiently by applying the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization methods.

Motions of the wings are captured with a high-speed camera. Flows around them are evaluated with phase locked PIV technique. As a result, bending vibration of the wings is observed almost all over the angles of attack while twisting is observed around the angles giving maximum lift force. The twisting vibration causes larger aerodynamic forces and delay in the stall. It is found that amplitude of the twisting determines magnitude of variations in aerodynamic forces. Flow field measurement shows the twisting vibration generates periodic vortices shedding from the leading and trailing edges.

This incurs the issue of wireless pilot authentication (WPA), that is, verifying the authenticity of pilots and claimed CSIs. In this paper, we, for multiantenna V2I orthogonal frequency division multiplexed communications, develop a PHY-layer cover-free (PHY-CF) coding theory to build up a secure WPA (SWPA) protocol. Here, we encode and convey vehicle pilot signals into diversified subcarrier activation patterns (SAPs) on the time-frequency domain by employing cover-free coding. We redesign the decoding procedure using the signal independence characteristic such that those encoded SAPs, though camouflaged by malicious signals and superimposed onto each other in wireless environment, could be separated, identified and decoded into the original pilots securely. For this protocol, we prove that perfect pilot conveying and separation could be both guaranteed. We formulate the pilot identification error probability (IEP) and show how PHY-CF coding could help position the location of attacker and reduce IEP to further achieve ultrasecurity. Considering 20 MHz long-term evolution bandwidth, we prove that the number of co-time co-frequency vehicles that are securely authenticated achieves up to 19\,\,{\times }\,\, {X} for X serving sectors of base station type RSU and the latency time of uplink data access is up to 1.5 ms, thus furthering the autonomous driving.

However, while fluorescence provides a proxy for phytoplankton, heterotrophic populations remain challenging to monitor in real-time and at high resolution. Bathyphotometers, sensors which measure the light emitted by bioluminescent organisms when mechanically stimulated, provide the capability to identify bioluminescent dinoflagellates and zooplankton. In the coastal ocean, highly abundant dinoflagellates emitting low-intensity flashes generate a background bioluminescence signal, while rarer zooplankton emit bright flashes that can be individually resolved by high-frequency sensors. Bathyphotometers were deployed from ships and onboard autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) during three field campaigns in Monterey Bay, California. Ship-based in situ water samples were simultaneously collected and the plankton communities characterized. Plankton concentrations were matched with concurrent datasets of fluorescence and bioluminescence to develop proxies for autotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, other phytoplankton such as diatoms, copepods, larvaceans (appendicularians), and small jellies. The method extracts the bioluminescence background as a proxy for dinoflagellates, and exploits differences in bioluminescence flash intensity between several types of zooplankton to identify larvaceans, copepods and small jellies. Fluorescence is used to discriminate between autotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, and to identify other autotrophic plankton. Concurrent fluorometers and bathyphotometers onboard AUVs can thus provide a novel view of plankton diversity and phytoplankton/zooplankton interactions in the sea. © 2018 The Authors","Article","Final","Scopus"

In particular, the UAS guidance problem is formulated as an optimal control-based Multi-Objective Trajectory Optimization (MOTO) problem subject to suitable dynamic and geometric constraints. Direct transcription methods of the global orthogonal collocation (pseudospectral) family are exploited for the solution of the MOTO problem, generating optimal trajectories for curved GNSS approaches in real-time. Three degrees-of-freedom aircraft dynamics models and suitable GNSS satellite visibility models based on Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation ephemeris data are utilised in the MOTO solution algorithm. The performance of the proposed MOTO algorithm is evaluated in representative simulation case studies adopting the JAVELIN UAS as the reference platform. The paper focusses on descent and initial curved GNSS approach phases in a Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) scenario, where multiple manned/unmanned aircraft converge on the same short and curved final GNSS approach leg.

These conduction system perturbations can manifest as morphological changes on the surface electrocardiographic (ECG) signal. Assessment of these morphological changes can be challenging and time-consuming, as ECG signal features are often low in amplitude and subtle. The main aim of this study is to develop an automated computer aided diagnostic (CAD) system that can expedite the process of arrhythmia diagnosis, as an aid to clinicians to provide appropriate and timely intervention to patients. We propose an autoencoder of ECG signals that can diagnose normal sinus beats, atrial premature beats (APB), premature ventricular contractions (PVC), left bundle branch block (LBBB) and right bundle branch block (RBBB). Apart from the first, the rest are morphological beat-to-beat elements that characterize and constitute complex arrhythmia. The novelty of this work lies in how we modified the U-net model to perform beat-wise analysis on heterogeneously segmented ECGs of variable lengths derived from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The proposed system has demonstrated self-learning ability in generating class activations maps, and these generated maps faithfully reflect the cardiac conditions in each ECG cardiac cycle. It has attained a high classification accuracy of 97.32% in diagnosing cardiac conditions, and 99.3% for R peak detection using a ten-fold cross validation strategy. Our developed model can help physicians to screen ECG accurately, potentially resulting in timely intervention of patients with arrhythmia. © 2018","Article","Final","Scopus"

The shells trajectory is a 3D non-Cartesian MRI acquisition technique that samples the k-space using a series of concentric shells to achieve efficient 3D isotropic acquisition. Partial Fourier acquisition is an acceleration technique that is widely used in Cartesian MRI. It exploits the conjugate symmetry of k-space measurement to reduce the number of k-space samples compared to full-k-space acquisition, without loss of spatial resolution. For a Cartesian MRI acquisition, the direction of partial Fourier acceleration is aligned either with the phase encoded or frequency encoded direction. In those cases, the underlying image matrix can be reconstructed from the undersampled k-space data using a non-iterative, homodyne reconstruction framework. However, designing a non-Cartesian acquisition trajectory that is compatible with non-iterative homodyne reconstruction is not nearly as straightforward as in the Cartesian case. One reason is the non-iterative homodyne reconstruction requires (slightly over) half of the k-space to be fully sampled. Since the direction of partial Fourier acceleration varies throughout the acquisition in the non-Cartesian trajectory, directly applying the same partial Fourier acquisition pattern (as in Cartesian acquisitions) to a non-Cartesian trajectory does not necessarily yield a continuous, physically-achievable trajectory. In this work, we develop an asymmetric shells trajectory with fully-automated trajectory and gradient waveform design to achieve partial Fourier acquisition for the shells trajectory. We then demonstrate a non-iterative image reconstruction framework for the proposed trajectory. Phantom and in vivo brain scans based on spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) shells and magnetization-prepared shells (MP-shells) were performed to test the proposed trajectory design and reconstruction method. Our phantom and in vivo results demonstrate that the proposed partial Fourier shells trajectory maintains the desirable image contrast and high sampling efficiency from the fully sampled shells, while further reducing data acquisition time. © 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Three possible solutions of differing complexity and effectiveness are proposed to address the problem. The first method involves an active detection strategy, whereby carefully designed excitation signals are superimposed on the control commands to increase the detectability of the attack. In the second method, an unknown input observer is designed, which in addition to detecting the attack also estimates the magnitude of the attack. The third method entails designing an actuator system that makes use of variable frequency pulse-width modulated signals to improve the resilience of the actuator against malicious attacks.

In particular, we consider a two-UAV scenario when one UAV transmitter delivers the confidential information to a ground node (GN), and the other UAV jammer cooperatively sends the artificial noise to confuse the ground eavesdropper for protecting the confidentiality of the data transmission. By exploiting the fully controllable mobility, the two UAVs can adaptively adjust their locations over time (a.k.a. trajectories) to facilitate the secure communication and cooperative jamming. We assume that the two UAVs perfectly know the GN's location and partially know the eavesdropper's location a priori. Under this setup, we maximize the average secrecy rate from the UAV transmitter to the GN over one particular time period, by optimizing the UAVs' trajectories, jointly with their communicating/jamming power allocations. Although the formulated problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient solution by applying the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The study is a qualitative interview study. The interviews were analysed by means of qualitative content analysis. Two themes presented themselves: the NP role being an autonomous role suitable for non-urgent patients, and the NP role being diffuse as well as a threat to colleagues and organizational structures. The results indicate that the NP role can make a valuable contribution to meet current challenges in the emergency care context.

Moreover, maintenance accidents due to human factors have reached a significant level, but have received little attention in the existing research. To ensure the safety and sustainability of large UAS, we propose a system dynamics approach to model the maintenance risk mechanisms involving organizational, human, and technical factors, which made a breakthrough in the traditional event-chain static analysis method. Using the United States Air Force (USAF) MQ-1 Predator fleet case, the derived time-domain simulation represented the risk evolution process of the past two decades and verified the rationality of the proposed model. It was identified that the effects of maintainer human factors on the accident rate exceeded those of the technical systems in a long-term view, even though the technical reliability improvements had obvious initial effects on risk reduction. The characteristics of maintainer errors should be considered in system and maintenance procedure design to prevent them in a proactive way. It is also shown that the approach-derived SD model can be developed into a semi-quantitative decision-making support tool for improving the safety of large UAS in a risk-based view of airworthiness. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This method can provide a practical solution for situations where the UAV network may need external spectrum when dealing with congested spectrum or need to change its operational frequency due to security threats. Here we study a scenario where the UAV network performs a remote sensing mission. In this model, the UAVs are categorized to two clusters of relaying and sensing UAVs. The relay UAVs provide a relaying service for a licensed network to obtain spectrum access for the rest of UAVs that perform the sensing task. We develop a distributed mechanism in which the UAVs locally decide whether they need to participate in relaying or sensing considering the fact that communications among UAVs may not be feasible or reliable. The UAVs learn the optimal task allocation using a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm. Convergence of the algorithm is discussed and simulation results are presented for different scenarios to verify the convergence. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Didymos is an ideal target, since the 780 m primary, Didymos A, is well characterized, and the 163 m secondary, Didymos B, is sufficiently small to allow measurement of the kinetic deflection. Didymos also represents the population of Near Earth Objects that are the asteroids most likely to pose a near-term threat to Earth. Scheduled to launch in June 2021, the DART spacecraft will autonomously intercept Didymos B in October 2022, altering the orbit period of Didymos B with respect to Didymos A. The impact will occur when the Earth-Didymos range is close enough to allow observation by Earth-based optical and radio telescopes. The spacecraft will be guided to the impact by its on-board autonomous real-time system Small-body Maneuvering Autonomous Real-Time Navigation (SMART Nav). In addition, DART is carrying a 6U CubeSat provided by Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI). The CubeSat will provide imagery documentation of the impact, as well as in situ observation of the impact site and resultant ejecta plume. The development is currently in Phase C, with mission Critical Design Review (CDR) planned for summer 2019. It is a substantial challenge to navigate the DART spacecraft to a hypervelocity impact with the Didymos secondary. The DART spacecraft will carry an ion propulsion system with the NASA Evolutionary Xenon Thruster Commercial (NEXT-C)engine, which provides flexibility in trajectory design to achieve the desired Didymos arrival conditions. The trajectory maximizes the asteroid deflection with an arrival velocity of 6 km/s relative to Didymos-B, while maintaining a proximity to Earth that allows both observation of the impact, and sufficient communication gain to recover imagery of the target upon the approach. Additionally, NEXT-C allows the mission an opportunity to fly by another asteroid and characterize SMART Nav performance seven months prior to its use for the Didymos impact. The DART spacecraft carries 22 m2 solar arrays to generate the 3.5 kW needed to power the NEXT-C engine. These long arrays introduce substantial flexible body motion to the spacecraft. This motion must be managed carefully to maintain the DART narrow angle camera on the target asteroid, even while performing the necessary autonomous ΔV maneuvers required to intercept the target. Guidance to Didymos B is further complicated by having to switch targets late in the approach, as SMART Nav must target the primary asteroid initially, as the secondary is too small to be resolved by the narrow angle camera until 1 hour prior to impact. Shadowing of both primary and secondary set by arrival lighting makes it challenging to impact at the center of Didymos B. The spacecraft streams images back to Earth in real time, up until impact. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The optimization was carried out for two types of Aircraft which categories as microlight Air vehicle(MAV) and unmanned Air vehicle(UAV). Simulation results were validated analytically for both microlight Air vehicle and unmanned Air vehicle for the variation of roll angle with the velocity for a given turn radius. The validation was performed for fixed turn radii varying from twenty meters to hundred meters including infinite turn radius in straight and steady level flight using standard level turn methods. Throughout the analysis, the optimization results are closely following the analytical results for microlight Air vehicle (MAV) as well as unmanned Air vehicle (UAV). The trim analysis of air vehicle is also carried out in a Coordinated Level turn where the flight path is curved, and the zero sideslip angle (coordinated level turn) consists of a constant altitude inertial trajectory in a horizontal plane parallel to the ground surface. For the optimization, required inputs are flight velocity, flight path angle, turn radius and an initial guess of roll angle, with this by subjecting the constraint of the angle of attack, bank angle and side slip angle along with current state derivatives. As per novel aspect concern this optimization method economizes the computation time and results in desirable trim points using these trim points controller can be designed by construction a flight envelope in coordinated turn that will lead to developing the autopilot of the aerial vehicle. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Computer-assisted detection and characterization of colonic polyps for instance, were amongst the first successful applications of AI, and should be commercially available shortly. The automated reading of a capsule endoscopy, based on a network of machine learning systems, is also very demonstrative of what AI will be able to accomplish in the next future. It is believed that AI will significantly improve diagnostic performances and thus the quality of care.

From the perspective of reliability, it is difficult to ensure that multirotors do not generate hardware and software failures or performance anomalies during the flight process. These failures and anomalies may result in mission interruptions, crashes, and even threats to the lives and property of human beings. Thus, the study of flight reliability problems of multirotors is conductive to the development of the drone industry and has theoretical significance and engineering value. This paper proposes a reliable flight performance assessment method of multirotors based on an Interacting Multiple Model Particle Filter (IMMPF) algorithm and health degree as the performance indicator. First, the multirotor is modeled by the Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) model, and the problem of reliable flight performance assessment is formulated. In order to solve the problem, the IMMPF algorithm is presented to estimate the real-time probability distribution of hybrid state of the established SHS-based multirotor model, since it can decrease estimation errors compared with the standard interacting multiple model algorithm based on extended Kalman filter. Then, the reliable flight performance is assessed with health degree based on the estimation result. Finally, a case study of a multirotor suffering from sensor anomalies is presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics","Article","Final","Scopus"

The experimental results of stream-wise mean velocity, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and Reynolds stresses were used to validate the predictive capability of a Reynolds stress model (RSM) with the wall reflection term of the pressure strain correlation. From the high fidelity RSM based simulations it is observed that in presence of free stream turbulence, the pressure, skin friction, drag and lift coefficients decrease on the AUV hull. The variation of the hydrodynamic coefficients were also plotted along the AUV hull for different values of submergence depth and angle of attack with different levels of free stream turbulence.

As pHH can cause life-threatening emergencies if occurring without warning symptoms, challenge testing may detect patients at risk. The study objective was to determine the frequency of occurrence of pHH with or without symptoms of hypoglycemia after RYGB. Methods: We undertook an observational cohort study of consecutive, unselected patients approximately one year after uncomplicated RYGB. To simulate normal habits, all patients received a standardized carbohydrate-rich solid mixed meal. Plasma glucose and insulin were measured at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min thereafter. Symptoms were classified as autonomous or neuroglycopenic. Patients with hypoglycemia (plasma glucose <3.0 mmol/L [55 mg/dL]), were tested a second time with a protein-rich solid mixed meal. Results: 113 patients were included. Total weight loss at the first follow-up check (14 ± 0.4 months) was 33.97 ± 9.3%. After the carbohydrate-rich meal, glucose dropped to <3.0 mmol/L in 13.2% (n = 15) of patients vs no drop to <3.0 mmol/L after a protein-rich meal. The pHH occurred in 11.5% (n = 13) of patients. Asymptomatic patients (5.3%, n = 6) carried an increased risk (p = 0.008) for pHH. One patient needed emergency treatment after sudden loss of consciousness after the carbohydrate-rich meal. Conclusions: The occurrence of pHH was quite high in our study population with 11.5% thereof 5.3% asymptomatic. We therefore suggest that detection of these patients warrants a screening of patients after RYGB. At-risk patients should than be adequately advised to avoid carbohydrate-rich meals in order to optimize risk management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism","Article","Final","Scopus"

One of the key factors of these technologies is the possibility to exploit the synergy between powertrain, structure, and mission. This investigation addresses this topic by applying multi-objective optimization to two test cases-a fixed-wing, tail-sitter, Vertical Take-off and Landing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VTOL-UAV), and a Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (MALE-UAV). Cruise time and payload weight were selected as goals for the first optimization problem, while fuel consumption and electric endurance were selected for the second one. The optimizations were performed with Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and S-Metric Selection Evolutionary Multiobjective Algorithm (SMS-EMOA), by taking several constraints into account. The VTOL-UAV optimization was performed, at different levels (structure only, power system only, structure and power system together). To better underline the synergic effect of electrification, the potential benefit of structural integration and multi-functionalization was also addressed. The optimization of the MALE-UAV was performed at two different levels (power system only, power system, and mission profile together), to explore the synergic effect of hybridization. Results showed that large improvements could be obtained, either in the first test case when, both, the powertrain design and the aircraft structure were considered, and in the optimization of the hybrid electric UAV, where the optimization of the aircraft flight path gave a strong contribution to the overall performances. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Compared to the static terrestrial base stations (BSs) in cellular networks, UAV-mounted aerial BSs possess stronger line-of-sight links with the ground users due to their high altitude as well as high and flexible mobility in 3D space, which can be exploited to enhance the communication performance. On the other hand, unlike terrestrial BSs that have reliable power supply, aerial BSs in practice have limited onboard energy, but require high propulsion power to stay airborne and support high mobility. Motivated by the above new considerations, this article aims to revisit some fundamental trade-offs in UAV-enabled communication and trajectory design.

Therefore, the grid velocity method was used to analyze the gust response characteristics of the airfoil FX63-137 under low Reynolds number. First, the reliability of the numerical simulation method at low Reynolds number and grid velocity method were verified with experimental data. Second, the gust response characteristics of FX63-137 airfoil under different Reynolds numbers and different angles of attack were numerically simulated. The results show that the magnitude of incremental lift coefficient in gust response decreases because laminar separation bubbles are complete as the Reynolds number decreases at a small angle of attack. They also show that laminar separation bubbles have an unloaded effect on gust response. At a high angle of attack, as the airfoil enters into stalling stage, the incremental lift coefficient begins to decline before reaching maximum gust disturbance. Because of the stalling of the airfoil, when the gust disappears, the incremental lift coefficient has a negative value. What's more, although the effective angle of attack is equal, the flow structure of the airfoil is somewhat different in upstream and downstream moments. Compared with the downstream moment, the incremental lift coefficient at the upstream moment is generally larger, and the incremental lift coefficient curve of the airfoil forms a non-closed hysteresis loop. © 2019 Journal of Northwestern Polytechnical University.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Sensor and actuator failures of a UAV are one of the most common malfunctions, threating the safety and life of the UAV. Fault-tolerant control technology is an effective method to improve the reliability and safety of UAV, which also contributes to vehicle health management (VHM). This paper deals with the sliding mode fault-tolerant control of the UAV, considering the failures of sensor and actuator. Firstly, a terminal sliding surface is designed to ensure the state of the system on the sliding mode surface throughout the control process based on the simplified coupling dynamic model. Then, the sliding mode control (SMC) method combined with the RBF neural network algorithm is used to design the parameters of the sliding mode controller, and with this, the efficiency of the design process is improved and system chattering is minimized. Finally, the Simulink simulations are carried out using a fault tolerance controller under the conditions where accelerometer sensor, gyroscope sensor or actuator failures is assumed. The results show that the proposed control strategy is quite an effective method for the control of UAVs with accelerometer sensor, gyroscope sensor or actuator failures. © 2019 by the authors.

In the second scenario, the minimum number of UAVs needed to provide full coverage for all ground users is determined. Finally, given the load requirements of the ground users, the total flight time (i.e., energy) that the UAVs need to completely serve the ground users is minimized. Simulation results using a real area of the Virginia Tech campus show that the proposed environment-aware drone deployment framework with Google Earth input significantly enhances the network performance in terms of coverage and energy consumption, compared to classical deployment approaches that do not exploit geographical information. In particular, the results show that the proposed approach yields a coverage enhancement by a factor of 2, and a 65% improvement in energy-efficiency. The results have also shown the existence of an optimal number of drones that leads to a maximum wireless coverage performance. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In all the three domains of Navy, Air force and Infantry battlefield, the most potent warfare options reside with Air force. There has to be coordination among the above-mentioned domains so that there is limited collateral damage and the enemy suffers heavy causalities. The current paper visualizes a scenario where the Infantry soldiers on the ground are on the move to capture enemy vital assets with the help of coordinated air attacks. To coordinate with the ground realities and air assets, the top priority of Airspace Management (ASM) remains the conflict detection and conflict resolution. Currently, the airspace has become crowded with the traditional aircraft and advanced Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). This requires closer coordination between the participating entities in the war zone. To support such decision support systems, we propose a novel solution to integrate the Internet of Tings (IoT) devices with battlefield devices. In this paper, we describe the motivation and a theoretical framework of an IoT based system that attempts to automate aspects of Future Battlefield Airspace Management (FBAM). Also, we propose a novel conflict detection algorithm which takes in to account the static and dynamic ground establishments. Further, this FBAM is responsible for conflict detection in flights with different geometrical analysis. These conflicts are sent to the concerned ground establishments using the IoT based hierarchical architecture. Finally, the data collected from the IoT based nodes in the FBAM is used to resolve conflicts and assist the decision support systems. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

One of the important UAV invasion defense methods is radar network detection. To form a tight and reliable radar surveillance network with limited resources, it is essential to investigate optimized radar network deployment. This optimization problem is difficult to solve due to its nonlinear features and strong coupling of multiple constraints. To address these issues, we propose an improved firefly algorithm that employs a neighborhood learning strategy with a feedback mechanism and chaotic local search by elite fireflies to obtain a trade-off between exploration and exploitation abilities. Moreover, a chaotic sequence is used to generate initial firefly positions to improve population diversity.

With an ever widening domain of aerial robotic applications, including many mission critical tasks such as disaster response operations, search and rescue missions and infrastructure inspections taking place in GPS-denied environments, the need for reliable autonomous operation of aerial robots has become crucial. To accomplish their tasks, aerial robots operating in GPS-denied areas rely on a multitude of sensors to localize and navigate. Visible spectrum camera systems correspond to the most commonly used sensing modality due to their low cost and weight rendering them suitable for small aerial robots in indoor or broadly GPS-denied settings. However, in environments that are visually-degraded such as in conditions of poor illumination, low texture, or presence of obscurants including fog, smoke and dust, the reliability of visible light cameras deteriorates significantly. Nevertheless, maintaining reliable robot navigation in such conditions is essential if the robot is to perform many of the critical applications listed above. In contrast to visible light cameras, thermal cameras offer visibility in the infrared spectrum and can be used in a complementary manner with visible spectrum cameras for robot localization and navigation tasks, without paying the significant weight and power penalty typically associated with carrying other sensors such as 3D LiDARs or a RADAR. Exploiting this fact, in this work we present a multi-sensor fusion algorithm for reliable odometry estimation in GPS-denied and degraded visual environments. The proposed method utilizes information from both the visible and thermal spectra for landmark selection and prioritizes feature extraction from informative image regions based on a metric over spatial entropy. Furthermore, inertial sensing cues are integrated to improve the robustness of the odometry estimation process. The proposed method works in real-time, fully on-board an aerial robot. To verify our solution, a set of challenging experiments were conducted inside a) an obscurant-filed machine shop-like industrial environment, as well as b) a dark subterranean mine in the presence of heavy airborne dust. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Applications of UAS are dependent on successful communications of these systems with different entities in their networks. A UAS network can include the UAS, ground control station, navigation satellite system, and automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) receiver. Through these entities, a UAS is vulnerable to different cyber-attacks such as GPS spoofing. In this attack, a malicious user transmits fake signals to the GPS receiver on the UAS. The fake signals can mislead not only the aircraft but also air traffic controllers, leading to serious problems. These problems range from aircraft hijacking to collisions and human casualties. This paper proposes a supervised machine learning method based on the artificial neural network to detect GPS spoofing signals. Different features such as pseudo range, Doppler shift, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are used to perform the classification of GPS signals.

Pre-planning is simple and feasible for the coverage search mission of single UAV in regular areas. As to the dynamic mission in complicated environment of multi-UAV, the route planning will encounter the difficulties of reasonable task distribution and the real-time environment changes which include the changes of the mission area, the detection of threat area, the interference of communication and so on. At this point, making the UAV to do real-time autonomous planning is necessary. However, it is hard to fulfil requirements of real-time, autonomous and efficient at the same time. According to a scalable knowledge base, this paper proposes a coverage search algorithm which is based on the mapping between the basic behavior combination and surroundings. A UAV’s coverage search simulation model with random shapes is built with a discrete map to update the environment and the changes of the mission on time. Comparison of the simulation analysis and the dynamic programming shows that the method has amazing expandability and can change the search strategy feasibly.

The device has a wingspan of 2.60 m and weighed 3.5 kg, including payload. It was essentially developed to investigate turbulence in a way complementary to other existing measurement systems, such as instrumented towers/masts. OVLI-TA’s instrumental package includes a 5-hole probe on the nose of the airplane to measure attack and sideslip angles, a Pitot probe to measure static pressure, a fast inertial measurement unit, a GPS receiver, as well as temperature and moisture sensors in specific housings. In addition, the Pixhawk autopilot is used for autonomous flights. OVLI-TA is capable of profiling wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and humidity up to 1 km altitude, in addition to measuring turbulence. After wind tunnel calibrations, flight tests were conducted in March 2016 in Lannemezan (France), where there is a 60-m tower equipped with turbulence sensors. In July 2016, OVLI-TA participated in the international project DACCIWA (Dynamics-Aerosol-Chemistry-Clouds Interactions in West Africa), in Benin. Comparisons of the OVLI-TA observations with both the 60 m tower measurements and the radiosonde profiles showed good agreement for the mean values of wind, temperature, humidity, and turbulence parameters. Moreover, it validated the capacity of the drone to sample wind fluctuations up to a frequency of around 10 Hz, which corresponds to a spatial resolution of the order of 1 m. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Transition between cruise level flight at angle of attack (AOA)= 4°, and harrier level flight at AOA = 50° is implemented, on a variable pitch propeller design, in which the pitch of the propeller is actuated to change thrust, at constant rotations per minute (RPM). In a conventional design, the thrust is changed by varying RPM which is actuated by a Brush-less DC (BLDC)motor whereas in a VPP design, the propeller pitch is actuated by a servo motor which has faster response compared to a BLDC motor used in small UAVs. Hence the thrust change is achieved faster using variable pitch actuation. A longitudinal model of an agile fixed-wing UAV which includes propwash, wing downwash, flat plate post-stall aerodynamics and actuator constraints (first order dynamics, saturation and rate limit) is used in the work. The model of a variable pitch propeller is developed from the data of a particular propeller motor combination obtained from a software named QPROP. The longitudinal control used is a backstepping based nonlinear control. The simulation results are compared with that of a conventional design in which the same flight regime with the nonlinear control is implemented. The advantages of VPP based design are observed to be faster settling of velocity, AOA and pitch rate during transitions, very small altitude variation and reduction in maximum pitch rate during cruise to harrier transition. However, an increase in maximum pitch rate during harrier to cruise transition is a disadvantage. But overall, the simulation results shows that VPP design performs better than a conventional design for the above mentioned flight regime and indicates that a VPP based design of fixed-wing agile UAVs would be better for control in agile and high AOA maneuvers like perching, transition to hover and aggressive maneuvers. However, flight testing is essential to conclude this fully. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Vector control has been implemented as a key strategy in malaria prevention for decades. A rising threat to the efficacy of vector control efforts is the development of insecticide resistance, thus it is important to monitor the type and frequency of insecticide resistant alleles in the disease vectors such as An. sinensis along the China-Vietnam border. Such information is needed to synthesize effective malaria vector control strategies. Methods: A total of 208 adults of An. sinensis, collected from seven sites in southwest Guangxi along the China-Vietnam border, were inspected for the resistance-conferring G119S mutation in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism) and kdr mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) by sequencing. In addition, the evolutionary origin of An. sinensis vgsc gene haplotypes was analyzed using Network 5.0. Results: The frequencies of mutant 119S of AChE were between 0.61-0.85 in the seven An. sinensis populations. No susceptible homozygote (119GG) was detected in three of the seven sites (DXEC, LZSK and FCGDX). Very low frequencies of kdr (0.00-0.01) were detected in the seven populations, with most individuals being susceptible homozygote (1014LL). The 1014F mutation was detected only in the southeast part (FCGDX) at a low frequency of 0.03. The 1014S mutation was distributed in six of the seven populations with frequencies ranging from 0.04 to 0.08, but absent in JXXW. Diverse haplotypes of 1014L and 1014S were found in An. sinensis along the China-Vietnam border, while only one 1014F haplotype was detected in this study. Consistent with a previous report, resistant 1014S haplotypes did not have a single origin. Conclusions: The G119S mutation of AChE was present at high frequencies (0.61-0.85) in the An. sinensis populations along the China-Vietnam border, suggesting that the vector control authorities should be cautious when considering carbamates and organophosphates as chemicals for vector control. The low frequencies (0.00-0.11) of kdr in these populations suggest that pyrethroids remain suitable for use against An. sinensis in these regions. © 2019 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

Traffic generated by these sensors congest traditional intra-car networks, such as CAN buses. Furthermore, the large amount of wires needed to connect sensors makes it harder to design cars in a modular way. To alleviate these limitations, we propose, simulate, and implement a hybrid wired/wireless architecture, in which each node is connected to either a wired interface or a wireless interface or both. Specifically, we propose a new protocol, called Hybrid-Backpressure Collection Protocol (Hybrid-BCP), to efficiently collect data from sensors in intra-car networks. Hybrid-BCP is backward-compatible with the CAN bus technology, and builds on the BCP protocol, designed for wireless sensor networks. We theoretically prove that an idealized version of Hybrid-BCP achieves optimal throughput. Our testbed implementation, based on CAN and ZigBee transceivers, demonstrates the load balancing and routing functionalities of Hybrid-BCP and its resilience to DoS attacks and wireless jamming attacks. We further provide simulation results, obtained with the ns-3 simulator and based on real intra-car RSSI traces, that compare between the performance of Hybrid-BCP and a tree-based data collection protocol. Notably, the simulations show that Hybrid-BCP outperforms the tree-based protocol on throughput by 12 percent. The results also show that Hybrid-BCP maintains high packet delivery rate and low packet delay for safety-critical sensors that are directly connected to the sink through wire. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Electrical potential energy of the membrane is transferred to a capacitor connected to the cell via a proper electrical circuit. Once the capacitor has reached the planned amount of energy, the circuit is disconnected from the cell and the stored energy is used to power a radio frequency communication that carries bio-sensed information to a distanced receiving circuit.

The focus of this paper is on Autonomous Vehicular Safety (AVS) management systems. Such systems exploit vehicular and road side infrastructures to increase the effectiveness of vehicular communications and the relevant services and applications offered in urban environments. AVS management systems combine physical with digital components, each with different capabilities, and involve many different stakeholders, with often competing goals. Sophisticated development of algorithms for simulating the behaviour of the AVS system is required to avoid wasted resources if, after it is implemented, shortcomings with respect to the originally stated goals are found. To achieve this, a capability-oriented modelling approach is introduced and applied to AVS using the CORE framework. This paper argues that the development of an AVS system entails a coherent approach that gradually progresses from vague statements of requirements to the algorithm implementation. To this end, the paper demonstrates how one may proceed from requirements to implementation in a systematic and model-driven manner, while simulation results prove the applicability of the approach. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we study the achievable rate of UAV-based communication under Ricean fading, where the transceivers of UAV is equipped with circular antenna array (UCA) configuration. We exploit an effective statistical-eigenmode space division multiple-access transmission (SE-SDMA) scheme with only the knowledge of the CSI at the UAV's transceivers. An exact expression on the achievable rate of UAV-based communication systems with UCA configuration is derived, in which the transceivers utilizes the channel response vector as the beamforming precoder. Based on the derived theoretical results, we gain the relationships of the achievable SE and the system parameters, such that the achievable sum-rate tends to a saturation value in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. In addition, we find that the high Ricean K-factor and the small values of inner product between different statistical channel vector are contribute to the achievable sum-rate of the UAV-based communication system. © 2018","Article","Final","Scopus"

Airfoil icing increases the aerodynamic drag coefficient, while reducing the maximum lift coefficient and the stall angle. This results in degraded endurance and safety of an UAV. Recently de-icing solutions for fixed-wing UAVs have been developed. These solutions use resistive heating in order to melt the ice on the wings. However, since this requires a high amount of energy it is desirable to only heat the wings if significant icing occurs. In this paper, a method for automatic icing detection is presented. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) is used, which combines aerodynamic, kinematic and stochastic wind models with data from a typical autopilot sensor suite to estimate angle of attack and lift coefficients. The sensor suite consists of an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, a heading reference and a pitot-static tube. Within the MHE an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is used for arrival cost approximation. FENSAP icing simulations show that in severe icing conditions, both the offset and the gradient of the lift coefficient change. Based on these icing simulations an UAV flight simulator that can simulate icing has been used. Simulation results show that the MHE is capable of monitoring changes in offset and gradient of the lift coefficient due to icing. A faster convergence to the estimated coefficient values could be achieved when using an external trigger signal, i.e. from a temperature and humidity sensor, to reset the covariance matrix of the arrival cost. We also investigate the effect on convergence speed resulting from an altitude change giving additional excitation. The estimation results show angle of attack estimation errors below 1 degree. These estimates can be used to limit the angle of attack and adjust the commanded airspeed in the autopilot in order to avoid stall. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Toward that end, it is vital to exploit all degrees of freedom of wireless networks efficiently, so that the service quality is not sacrificed. In order to reap the benefits of flexible networking, we propose a spatial network configuration (SNC) scheme, which can result in efficient networking; both from the perspective of network capacity and profitability. First, the SNC utilizes the drone-base-stations (drone-BSS) to configure access points. Drone-BSS are shifting paradigms of heterogeneous wireless networks by providing radically flexible deployment opportunities. On the other hand, their limited endurance and potential high cost increase the importance of utilizing drone-BSS efficiently. Therefore, second, user mobility is exploited via user-in-The-loop (UIL), which aims at influencing users' mobility by offering incentives. The proposed uncoordinated SNC is a computationally efficient method, yet, it may be insufficient to exploit the synergy between the drone-BSS and UIL. Hence, we propose a joint SNC, which increases the performance gain along with the computational cost. Finally, the semi-joint SNC combines the benefits of the joint SNC with computational efficiency. The numerical results show that the semi-joint SNC is two orders of magnitude faster than the joint SNC, and a profit of more than 15% can be obtained compared to conventional systems. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In general, it is easier to detect smoke than fire in its early stage. Developing an effective and safe smoke detection method is thereby critical for early forest fire fighting and preventing the fire developing into uncontrollable. This paper presents a learning-based fuzzy smoke detection approach intended to achieve an effective and early forest fire detection, while greatly reduce the negative impacts from clouds in the sky, illumination variations, and changes of forest features. First, a fuzzy-logic based smoke detection rule is designed for detecting and segmenting smoke regions in the visual images captured by the camera onboard an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The differences of each two components of red, green, and blue (RGB) model and intensity in hue, saturation, and intensity (HSI) model of images are chosen as inputs of a fuzzy logic rule, while the smoke likelihood is selected as its output. Then, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is further employed for reshaping the inputs and output of the fuzzy smoke detection rule on-line. It is expected to provide the smoke detection method with additional regulating flexibility adapting to variations of environmental conditions and reliable automatic detection performance. Next, the morphological operation is also adopted to remove imperfections induced by noises and textures distorted nonconvex/concave segments. Finally, extensive studies on several sets of images containing smoke under distinct environmental conditions are conducted to validate the proposed methodology. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Researchers have proposed intersection management approaches that use the position and velocity that are reported by vehicles to compute a schedule for vehicles to safely and efficiently traverse the intersection. However, a vehicle may fail to follow intersection manager (IM) scheduling commands due to erroneous sensor readings or unexpected incidents like engine failure, which can cause an accident if the failure happens inside the intersection. Additionally, rogue vehicles can take the advantage of the IM by providing false position and velocity data and cause traffic congestion. In this paper, we present a new technique and infrastructure to detect anomalies and inform the IM. We propose a vision system that can monitor the position of incoming vehicles and provide real-time data for the IM. The IM can use this data to verify the trajectories of CAVs and broadcast a warning when a vehicle fails to follow commands, making the IM more resilient against attacks and false data. We implemented our method by building infrastructure for an intersection with 1/10 scale model CAVs. Results show our method, when combined with an IM dataflows, is more dependable in the event of a failure compared to an IM without it. © Rachel Dedinsky, Mohammad Khayatian, Mohammadreza Mehrabian, and Aviral Shrivastava.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, the real autopilot scene is quite complicated. The first accident of autopilot occurred in 2016. It resulted in a fatal crash where the white side of a vehicle appeared similar to a brightly lit sky. The root of the problem is that the autopilot vision system cannot identify the part of a vehicle when the part is similar to the background. A method called DIDA was first proposed based on the deep learning network to see the hidden part. DIDA cascades the following steps: object detection, scaling, image inpainting assuming a hidden part beside the car, object re-detection from inpainted image, zooming back to the original size, and setting an alarm region by comparing two detected regions. DIDA was tested in a similar scene and achieved exciting results. This method solves the aforementioned problem only by using optical signals.

First we report on the effect of montmorillonite (MMT) clay on the fiber tensile and vacuole lateral compression properties. It is found that the fiber tensile properties are enhanced with increasing MMT concentration, while the effects on the vacuole lateral compression properties are seemingly negligible. The second part of this work shows the proof of concept of healing by compartmented fibers in glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites. A single- and a double-healing agent configuration, both based on epoxy–thiol chemistry, were compared in these model GFRP composites. The healing phenomena were quantified by mechanical characterization (interlaminar fracture and flexural testing) and nondestructive testing techniques (X-ray microtomography and air-coupled ultrasonic C-scanning). It is found that a configuration with one healing agent is favorable over a system with two separate agents and that further exploitation of the compartmented fiber concept should focus on the healing of matrix damage as the loss of mechanical integrity because of glass fiber fracture cannot be overcome.

Methods and analysis This randomised comparative effectiveness study was designed to assess the impact of care in the STEP clinic versus usual care on poststroke BP reduction. Eligible hospitalised patients with ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke or transient ischaemic attack are scheduled for a clinic screening visit within 4 weeks of discharge if they meet baseline inclusion criteria. At the clinic visit, patients who have uncontrolled BP, defined as automated office BP ≥135/85 mm Hg are randomised (1:1) to either the STEP clinic or usual care for management. STEP clinic patients receive instructions to self-monitor, a BP monitor, sleep apnoea screening, dietary counselling, review of BP monitoring records and adjustment of medications. Patients are followed by a neurologist and a stroke-trained nurse practitioner.

We consider five different angles of attack, 10°, 12.5°, 15°, 17.5°, and 20°, with the Reynolds number varying from 100 to 1300. The central aim is to study the wake dynamics under the low-Reynolds-number condition, when the flow is most likely experiencing transitions between different states. For the low angles of attack of α = 10° and α = 12.5°, we find different branches on the Strouhal-Reynolds number relationship curves. Specifically, for α = 10°, we identify four distinct branches, marked with L1 to L4, in which the second discontinuity between L3 and L4 is proved to be hysteretic, characterized by the wake deflection. The branches L1 and L2 differ from the other two in the near-body flow topology, with the ""trailing-edge vortex"" mode for the first two, while the ""separation vortex"" mode for the last two. For the high angles of attack, α = 15°, 17.5°, and 20°, we cannot find marked discontinuity on the Strouhal-Reynolds number relationship curve. We further demonstrate that the flow transits to a chaotic state by a sequence of successive period-doubling bifurcations at α = 20°. Our results suggest that the operation of micro unmanned air vehicles in very low Reynolds numbers should be treated with caution because the flow is very sensitive to the Reynolds number, as well as the angle of attack. © 2019 Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

"A systematic review of coastal vulnerability assessment studies along Andhra Pradesh, India: A critical evaluation of data gathering, risk levels and mitigation strategies","2019","Water (Switzerland)","10.3390/w11020393","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065062211&doi=10.3390%2fw11020393&partnerID=40&md5=c661e736acb9fdc6c3e3afaec1e6e81b","The establishment and alteration of any coastal feature is largely dependent upon complex hydrological and geomorphologic processes. Therefore, understanding hazard factors and threat risk level is crucial for mitigating risk in coastal zones. This study examines coastal vulnerability factors and their influence along the Coastal Andhra Pradesh (CAP) region in India. CAP has been exposed to frequent hydrological and meteorological hazards due to variations in the geographical, geological, and bathymetric characteristics. Despite substantial vulnerabilities, the risk to the coastline of Andhra Pradesh has not been rigorously evaluated. The current research systematically reviews the drivers and effects of hazards and vulnerabilities in CAP. Findings indicate that urban cities have a considerably higher risk of cyclones and floods due to their locations on the Bay of Bengal tectonic plate, the topology of this coastal region, and higher population density. The study revealed that the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) data along CAP is mostly gathered using low-resolution satellite data and/or field observation surveys. The study further revealed that there are very few existing mitigation strategies developed or discussed within the obtained results. However, more accurate data gathering techniques for coastal vulnerability factors are available such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs): Air-borne and LiDAR sensors, which provide very high resolution data and low-cost accessibility to physically inaccessible places, making them suitable for vulnerability data collection in coastal locations. These findings are useful for stakeholders seeking to reduce or ameliorate the impact of coastal disasters and their impacts on the CAP economy, environment, and population. The study further helps to reduce the existing shortcomings in the assessment techniques used previously. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The world has started probing the alternatives for efficient and resourceful sustenance along with utilization of advanced technology viz., satellites on earth. Space propulsion forms the core of space exploration. Of all the issues encountered, space debris has increasingly threatened a space exploration and propulsion. The efforts have resulted in the presence of disastrous space debris fragments orbiting the earth at speeds up to several kilometres per hour. Unsealed debris is universally projected as potential damage to the future missions with loss of resources, and mankind as a huge amount of money is invested into it. Appreciable work had been done in the past relating to active space debris removal technologies such as harpoon, net and drag sail. The primary emphasis is laid on confined removal. Recently, remove debris spacecraft was used for servicing and capturing cargo ships. Airbus designed and planned the debris-catching net experiment aboard the spacecraft. The spacecraft represents the largest payload deployed from the space station. However, the magnitude of the issue suggests that active space debris removal technologies, such as harpoons and nets, still would not be enough thus necessitating the need for better and operative space debris removal system techniques. Such techniques based on diverting the path of debris or the spacecraft to avert damage, have turned out minimal usage owing to limited predictions. Present work focuses on an active hybrid space debris removal system. The work is motivated by the need to have safer and efficient space missions. The specific objective of the work is to thoroughly analyse the existing and conventional debris removal techniques, their working, effectiveness, and limitations. Thus, a novel active space debris removal system is proposed. Second is to understand the role of key controlling parameters in coupled operation of debris capturing and removal. The system represents the utilization of the latest autonomous technology available with an adaptable structural design for operations under varying conditions. The design covers advantages of most of the existing technologies while removing the disadvantages. The system is likely to enhance the probability of effective space debris removal. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
"Longitudinal Control of Agile Fixed-Wing UAV Using Backstepping","2019","IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings","10.1109/AERO.2019.8742162","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068319294&doi=10.1109%2fAERO.2019.8742162&partnerID=40&md5=89fd4b6dd6b50cfa15cbef833828dbe1","In this paper, a nonlinear backstepping based longitudinal control is applied to an agile fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)to achieve transitioning between level flight at low angle of attack (cruise)and level flight at high angle of attack (harrier level)and the performance is compared with a gain scheduled state feedback control. In all flight regimes, the elevator control law is computed using backstepping control strategy designed for error dynamics in pitch and pitch rate. During transition from cruise to harrier flight, the propeller rotations per minute (RPM)is calculated using an additional Lyapunov based nonlinear control which stabilizes the error dynamics in flight path angle to zero. During cruise and harrier level, the respective trim value of RPM is applied and during transition from harrier to cruise the trim value corresponding to cruise is applied. Simulations of the control implemented on a longitudinal model of an agile fixed-wing UAV which includes propwash, wing downwash, flat plate post-stall aerodynamics and actuator constraints (first order dynamics, saturation and rate limit)to achieve the flight objective, are done using Matlab 9.4®. Compared to gain scheduled state feedback control, the advantages of the nonlinear control strategy are: 1)less altitude loss and oscillations in velocity and pitch angle during harrier to cruise transition, 2)reduction of around 60 % in maximum pitch rate during both transitions and 3)less chattering during both transitions. However, significant increase in computational complexity is a disadvantage. Overall, a preliminary assessment can be made that the nonlinear control strategy is better than the gain scheduled state feedback control for achieving the specific flight regime and could be advantageous in high angle of attack (AOA)maneuvers like perching, transition to hover and aggressive maneuvers. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Increasingly, computational tools are sought to accelerate materials discovery by computational predictions. Here are introduced a set of computationally inexpensive software tools that exploit the bond-valence-based empirical force field previously developed by the authors to enable high-throughput computational screening of experimental or simulated crystal-structure models of battery materials predicting a variety of properties of technological relevance, including a structure plausibility check, surface energies, an inventory of equilibrium and interstitial sites, the topology of ion-migration paths in between those sites, the respective migration barriers and the site-specific attempt frequencies. All of these can be predicted from CIF files of structure models at a minute fraction of the computational cost of density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and with the added advantage that all the relevant pathway segments are analysed instead of arbitrarily predetermined paths. The capabilities and limitations of the approach are evaluated for a wide range of ion-conducting solids. An integrated simple kinetic Monte Carlo simulation provides rough (but less reliable) predictions of the absolute conductivity at a given temperature. The automated adaptation of the force field to the composition and charge distribution in the simulated material allows for a high transferability of the force field within a wide range of Lewis acid–Lewis base-type ionic inorganic compounds as necessary for high-throughput screening. While the transferability and precision will not reach the same levels as in DFT simulations, the fact that the computational cost is several orders of magnitude lower allows the application of the approach not only to pre-screen databases of simple structure prototypes but also to structure models of complex disordered or amorphous phases, and provides a path to expand the analysis to charge transfer across interfaces that would be difficult to cover by ab initio methods. © International Union of Crystallography, 2019","Article","Final","Scopus"

Tracking is usually achieved by following the refugees' mobile devices. However, sometimes refugees do not hold mobiles to track them. To overcome this problem, we exploit the tracking systems of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which enable both image processing and mobile tracking depending on the scenario. UAV technology is a low-cost, flexible solution in missions that are difficult to execute by humans and other systems. After a disaster event, a safe map can be constructed from aerial imagery data of the moving pedestrians. Aerial data are also useful for evaluating damage in the stricken areas. The present study integrates UAVs into the Internet of Things, generating a pseudo scenario for the map generation. Experiments confirmed the usefulness of low-cost UAVs in tracking and scanning with and without smartphone tracking data. © 2018 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

In particular, novel formulations in the form of porous particles are sought for the treatment of respiratory disorders and the systemic administration of bioactive compounds using the pulmonary route. Aerogel particles, i.e. highly porous and light-weight nanoporous powders, are particularly promising as carriers for the pulmonary route.

A preliminary framework was proposed to undertake a quantitative assessment of the impact of earthquake-induced geological hazards on the natural landscapes. Four factors reflecting the aesthetic value, ecological value, integrity of landscapes were selected to assess their vulnerability. The impact of earthquake-induced geological hazards on the landscapes is quantitatively expressed as the product of their vulnerability and resilience. The assessment framework was applied to Jiuzhaigou Valley which was severely struck by the Ms 7.0 earthquake on August 8, 2017. Field survey, satellite image interpretation, high-resolution DEM and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) reconnaissance were used to retrieve the values of the assessment factors. Twenty seven World Heritage Sites in the valley strongly influenced by the earthquakeinduced geohazards were evaluated. The impact values of two sites of them (Sparking Lake and Nuorilang Waterfall) are up to 8.24 and 4.65, respectively, and their natural landscapes were greatly damaged. The assessment results show a good agreement with the actual damages of the heritage sites. © 2019, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This leads to the formation of new shorelines, which are highly dynamic regarding erosion and deposition processes. The present work aims to assess the direct human action along the largest reservoir in Europe-Kuibyshev (Russian Federation) and to analyse threatened cultural heritage sites from the coastal area, with the help of historical maps, UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), and topographic surveys. This approach is a necessity, due to the oscillating water level, local change of climate, and to the continuous increasing of natural hazards (in this case coastal erosion) all over the world. Many studies are approaching coastal areas of the seas and oceans, yet there are fewer studies regarding the inland coastal areas of large artificial reservoirs. Out of the total number of 1289 cultural heritage sites around the Kuibyshev reservoir, only 90 sites are not affected by the dam building; the rest had completely disappeared under the reservoir's water. The scenario of increasing and decreasing water level within the reservoir has shown the fact that there must be water oscillations greater than ±1 m in order to affect the cultural heritage sites. The results show that the coastal area is highly dynamic and that the complete destruction of the last remaining Palaeolithic site (Beganchik) from the shoreline of Kuibyshev reservoir is imminent, and immediate mitigation measures must be undertaken. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Seventy percent of the earth is covered by oceans. These oceans have been playing a very crucial role in transporting of goods even before the road. At the same time it cannot be ignored the possibilities of the negative role of the oceans- a very serious threat to human society and damage of man-made infrastructure through the natural phenomenon such as hurricanes and tsunamis, the latest being Hudhud in Visakhapatnam and Nilam in Chennai. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV), are considered as marine robots which are very useful for study of ocean resources such as aquaculture, offshore mining, ocean survey etc.,. This paper considers the dynamic modeling of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) which is used to track the AUV in the presence of ocean currents and other underwater environmental disturbances. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been attempted on AUV for control purpose. The main advantage of using MPC is it can easily handle multi input multi output systems very effectively. Constraints on inputs, states and outputs can also be considered using this technique. It has the ability to handle model mismatch and disturbances. Sensor noise can be estimated using filter and Kalman filtering plays an important role in AUV navigation. AUV sensors play an important role in data collection and remote sensing. Global Positioning satellite (GPS) may not work in underwater environment for remote sensing. Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor is used to find position of a vehicle and it may also helpful for remote sensing. Mathematical modeling and MPC formulations are the contributions of this paper. The results presented in this paper can be summarized in three points as dynamic modeling of AUV, stability issues, and formulation of MPC. All the simulations are carried out in MATLAB environment.

For instance, some accessions of wild species with higher salt tolerance than commercial varieties are being investigated for their potential to expand food production into marginal areas or to use brackish waters for irrigation. However, assessment of individual plant responses to salt stress in field trials is time-consuming, limiting, for example, longitudinal assessment of large numbers of plants. Developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) sensing technologies provide a means for extensive, repeated and consistent phenotyping and have significant advantages over standard approaches. In this study, 199 accessions of the wild tomato species, Solanum pimpinellifolium, were evaluated through a field assessment of 600 control and 600 salt-treated plants. UAV imagery was used to: (1) delineate tomato plants from a time-series of eight RGB and two multi-spectral datasets, using an automated object-based image analysis approach; (2) assess four traits, i.e., plant area, growth rates, condition and Plant Projective Cover (PPC) over the growing season; and (3) use the mapped traits to identify the best-performing accessions in terms of yield and salt tolerance. For the first five campaigns, >99% of all tomato plants were automatically detected. The omission rate increased to 2–5% for the last three campaigns because of the presence of dead and senescent plants. Salt-treated plants exhibited a significantly smaller plant area (average control and salt-treated plant areas of 0.55 and 0.29 m                             2                             , respectively), maximum growth rate (daily maximum growth rate of control and salt-treated plant of 0.034 and 0.013 m                             2                             , respectively) and PPC (5–16% difference) relative to control plants.

However, its preliminary design is devoid of any network security features. Military grade unmanned systems must be guarded against network threats. ROS 2 is built upon the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard and is designed to provide solutions to identified ROS 1 security vulnerabilities by incorporating authentication, encryption, and process profile features, which rely on public key infrastructure. The Department of Defense is looking to use ROS 2 for its military-centric robotics platform. This paper seeks to demonstrate that ROS 2 and its DDS security architecture can serve as a functional platform for use in military grade unmanned systems, particularly in unmanned Naval aerial swarms. In this paper, we focus on the viability of ROS 2 to safeguard communications between swarms and a ground control station (GCS). We test ROS 2's ability to mitigate and withstand certain cyber threats, specifically that of rogue nodes injecting unauthorized data and accessing services that will disable parts of the UAV swarm. We use the Gazebo robotics simulator to target individual UAVs to ascertain the effectiveness of our attack vectors under specific conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROS 2 in mitigating the chosen attack vectors but observed a measurable operational delay within our simulations. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The proposed PSO-CS algorithm combines the ability of social thinking in PSO with the local search capability in CS, which helps to overcome the problem of low convergence speed of CS. First, the quadrotor dynamic modeling is defined using Newton-Euler formalism. Second, PID (Proportional, Integral, and Derivative) controllers are optimized by using the intelligent proposed approaches and the classical method of Reference Model (RM) for quadrotor full control. Finally, simulation results prove that PSO and PSO-CS are more efficient in tuning of optimal parameters for the quadrotor control. Indeed, the ability of PSO and PSO-CS to track the imposed trajectories is well seen from 3D path tracking simulations and even in presence of wind disturbances. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Existing security measures primarily try to protect information property in the PC so as not to be compromised by malware. Such security measures are not so effective or efficient because the PC contains too many protected items to tightly control them in present ATM operational environments. This paper proposes a new ATM security measure based on secure peripheral devices; the secure dispenser in an ATM verifies the authenticity of a received dispensing command with the withdrawal transaction evidence, which is securely transferred from the secure card reader of an ATM. The card reader can capture the transaction evidence since all transaction data flows through the card reader in a smart card transaction. Even though the PC is compromised, unauthorized dispensing commands are not accepted by the secure dispenser. As a result, the new security measure does not impose heavy burden of tighter security managements for the PCs on financial institutes while achieving stringent security for the logical attacks to ATMs. Copyright © 2019 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Article","Final","Scopus"

For what regards break-out of chemical and radiological compounds, several episodes have occurred, such as unwanted industrial leakage, intentional use of chemical weapons by non-state actors or smuggling of nuclear material, that, by materializing a global threat, have conducted to casualties the actors involved, inter alia fire brigades and military first responders. Concerning the equipment provided to these operators, huge progresses have been done in portable detectors, now able to employ numerous different working principles and technologies. Nonetheless, especially during the survey phase after a CBRN release, the operators enter in a potentially contaminated area without knowing type and amount of the contamination, running the risk of losses during the reconnaissance. On the other hand, nowadays we are witnessing a worldwide spread development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), with countless uses in different fields. They have founded fruitful implementation across civil and military ground in aerial photography, express shipping, gathering information during disaster management, thermal sensor drones for search and rescue operations, geographic mapping of inaccessible locations, severe weather forecasting. What if we could send one or more of these flying platforms equipped with CBRN sensors, geo-localized, able to collect samples and to detect in real time a contamination. Subsequently, once the CBRN incident occurrence is confirmed, after the analysis of collected samples is likely to determine the chemical compound or the radiation emitter involved and the level of contamination. If all this is made feasible, we will be able to minimize or completely avoid the exposure of personnel, moreover it will be determined the exact position of the hotspot and better supported the choice of personal protective equipment to be used to enter in the hazard area.

These evolving technologies have not only transformed our workplaces but are also reshaping our living habits, including the way we communicate, travel, learn, and relax. In the field of transportation alone, a huge influx of highly-connected, situation-aware and even self-driving vehicles has been observed recently, thus revamping existing automobiles into smarter, automated and safer vehicular networks. This exponential rise in vehicular connectivity has introduced new terminologies such as Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), aiming towards road-safety, smart traffic management, and real-time information/incident sharing. However, these highly-connected vehicles have also introduced several novel security and safety threats both to the hosts and associated assets, inducing serious even life-threatening consequences. Compromise of location privacy and vehicular identity is one of such serious threats, which may be exploited by an adversary to launch sophisticated attacks including stalking, identity theft/manipulation or even tracking and sabotaging of VIP moves. Such threat vectors primarily exploit subtle vulnerabilities in resource-constrained communication protocols being deployed for vehicular connectivity as well as improper security configurations of associated systems. The threats can be countered by placement of robust network security techniques suiting the VANET environment. This survey paper aims to probe into these vulnerabilities of vehicular networks, classify associated security and safety threats, and ultimately asses various countermeasures to safeguard against privacy-breach situations. Besides presenting a holistic overview of emerging threats in vehicular networks, the paper critically analyzes some of the recent approaches (2008-2018) to safeguard against location privacy threats with reference to a range of operational and security considerations. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Since the online communications are exposed to numerous security threats, the mutual authentication and key agreement between patients and the medical servers are of prime significance. During the recent years, various user authentication schemes have been suggested for the TMISs. Nonetheless, most of them are susceptible to some known attacks or have high computational cost. Newly, an effective remote user authentication and session key agreement protocol has been introduced by Ravanbakhsh and Nazari for health care systems. Besides the nice contributions of their work, we found that it has two security weaknesses, namely, known session-specific temporary information attack and lack of perfect forward secrecy. As a result, to overcome these deficiencies, this paper suggests a novel anonymous and unlinkable user authentication and key agreement scheme for TMISs using the elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC). We have evaluated the security of the proposed scheme by applying the automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool with the intention of indicating that our scheme can satisfy the vital security features. In addition, we have compared the proposed protocol with related schemes to show that it has a proper level of performance. The obtained results demonstrate that the new scheme is more preferable considering both efficiency and security criteria. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The generated images are used as additional training data for a semantic segmentation network, which precisely detects vehicles in recordings of traffic on highways.

In this paper, we introduce a holistic and realistic framework that dynamically enables the ground users to invest their transmission power in an autonomous manner either in the UAV-based and/or MBS-based communication, while accounting for their Quality of Service (QoS) prerequisites and risk preferences. The UAV-based communication is characterized by limited available bandwidth, but close distance among the users and the UAV, thus resulting in users' low transmission powers and high achievable data rate, if properly utilized. In our work, the UAV's bandwidth is treated as a Common Pool of Resources (CPR), which can be exploited by all the users residing in the disaster area. However, the latter comes at the expense of resource fragility and potential failure from over-exploitation, due to its fully shared nature and excessive competition among the users. In contrast, the MBS due to its inherent characteristics acts as a safe resource, providing a guaranteed perceived satisfaction to the users based on their transmission power investment. Considering ground users' diverse behavioral patterns, when probabilistic uncertainty of the UAV's shared bandwidth is introduced, we model the ground users' power control problem under the principles of Prospect Theory. The formulated resource orchestration problem is solved as a Fragile CPR game and its convergence to a unique Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE) point is proven. A distributed low-complexity algorithm that converges to the unique PNE is devised, while the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through modeling and simulation. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Armed with hi-resolution digital optical technologies, these vantage points effectively constitute a ubiquitous visioning apparatus serving either the politics of promotion or surveillance. Given the political dimensions of this apparatus, it is important to note that this digital imaging of public urban space refers to the human visual system model. In order to mimic human vision, a set of algorithm patterns are used to direct numerous ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ technologies. Mimicry thus has a cost because this insistence on the human visual system model necessitates multiple transformative moments in the production and transmission pipeline. If each transformative moment opens a potential vulnerability within the visioning apparatus, then every glitch testifies to the artificiality of the image. Moreover, every glitch potentially interrupts the political narratives be communicated in contemporary image production and transmission. Paradoxically, the current use of scripting to create glitch-like images has reimagined glitches as a discrete aesthetic category. This article counters this aestheticisation by asserting glitching as a disruption in communication. The argument will rely on scaled tests produced by one of the authors who show how duplicating the digital algorithmic patterns used within the digital imaging pipeline on any exterior building surface glitches the visual data captured within that image. Referencing image-based techniques drawn from the Baroque and contemporary modes of camouflage, it will be argued that the visual aberrations created by these algorithm-based patterned facades can modify strategically the ‘emission signature’ of selected parts of the urban fabric.

They enable vehicles to communicate with each other in order to provide various services such as traffic safety, autonomous driving, and entertainments. The vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication channel is doubly selective, where the channel changes within the transmission bandwidth and the frame duration. This necessitates robust algorithms to provide reliable V2V communications. In this paper, we propose a scheme that provides joint adaptive modulation, coding and payload length selection (AMCPLS) for V2V communications. Our AMCPLS scheme selects both the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and the payload length of transmission frames for V2V communication links, according to the V2V channel condition. Our aim is to achieve both reliability and spectrum efficiency. Our proposed AMCPLS scheme improves the V2V effective throughput performance while satisfying a predefined frame error rate (FER). Furthermore, we present a deep learning approach that exploits deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for implementing the proposed AMCPLS. Simulation results reveal that the proposed DCNN-based AMCPLS approach outperforms other competing machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and support vector machines (SVM) in terms of FER, effective throughput, and prediction time. © 2019 by the authors.

Treatment options for infections caused by these microorganisms are very limited. Ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) and ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) are recently developed cephalosporin/betalactamase inhibitor combinations for the treatment of infections caused by MDR P. aeruginosa strains. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro efficacy of C/T and CZA against MDR P. aeruginosa strains and to compare the in vitro efficacy of these two drugs. Materials and Methods: Thirty-two MDR P. aeruginosa isolates were included in the study. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibilities of the strains were performed using a VITEK 2® automated system. The efficacy of CZA and C/T was determined by the gradient strip test (Liofilchem MIC strip test, Italy). Modified carbapenemase inactivation method was used to detect carbapenemase production in all strains. Results: Rates of antibiotic resistance in the isolates were 78% for amikacin, 96.8% for levofloxacin, 90.6% for ciprofloxacin, 71.8% for gentamicin, and 78% for netilmicin. Ceftazidime/avibactam resistance was detected in 7 (21.8%) of the isolates and C/T resistance in 10 (31.2%). All strains with resistance to CZA also had resistance to C/T. Three strains were resistant to C/T but susceptible to CZA. Carbapenemase production was positive in all strains. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that CZA and C/T may be an alternative treatment for some of the carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa infections. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these new treatment options against the increasing threat of MDR P. aeruginosa. ©Copyright 2019 by the Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology Specialty Society of Turkey.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To this end, it is assumed that satellite surfaces are equipped with small plates that are thermally isolated from the internal heat sources so that their temperature changes mainly arise from environmental radiation emanated mainly from the Sun and the Earth. In this sense, a thermal model is developed and demonstrated to show how the satellite surface temperatures and their time rates are the only ingredients needed, as measurement quantities, for the proposed OE method to produce the satellite navigational data in terms of its position and velocity vectors. In addition, the effect of sensor configuration on state observability and estimation accuracy is investigated while the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is exploited in the estimation process. Performance and viability of the proposed temperature-based OE are verified through Monte Carlo simulations and a comprehensive sensitivity analysis over orbital parameters, satellite initial conditions, sensor accuracy and attitude error. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Article","Final","Scopus"

These systems combine connectivity, coordination, adaptivity, and automated response for transportation policy optimization, thus increasing “smartness” and efficiency. However, the control and sensing systems of implemented ITS can open new vulnerabilities, especially to cyber-attacks. Currently vulnerability is managed within the framework of traditional risk assessment that assesses potential failures of the system in response to specified threats. Emerging technologies by their nature have threats that are not fully known, therefore, resilience, defined as the system's ability to recover and adapt to both known and unknown threats, is an emerging area that holds promise for assessing threats to ITS. To illustrate the applicability of resilience to ITS, we conducted a study of network efficiency and resilience in response to random and targeted disruptions of ITS systems in 10 urban areas. Disruptions were generated to affect either intersections or roadways controlled by ITS under different threat scenarios. Modeled attacks, under worst case scenarios, disrupted 20% of intersections causing on average 14.6% more additional delays than the same severity attacks on roadways. Additionally, locking traffic signal states was found to cause more disruption than fully disabling signals. Thus, as cities adopt ITS and other smart systems resulting in potentially unknown vulnerabilities, it is important to consider resilience of transportation infrastructure affected by potential cyber-attacks. © 2019","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, an adversarial example created by adding a little noise to the original data can lead to misclassification by the DNN, and the human eye cannot detect the difference from the original data. For example, if an attacker generates a modified left-Turn road sign to be incorrectly categorized by a DNN, an autonomous vehicle with the DNN will incorrect classify the modified left-Turn road sign as a right-Turn sign, whereas a human will correctly classify the modified sign as a left-Turn sign. Such an adversarial example is a serious threat to a DNN. Recently, a multi-Target adversarial example was introduced that causes misclassification by several models within each target class using a single modified image. However, it has the vulnerability that as the number of target models increases, the overall attack success rate is reduced. Therefore, if there are several models that the attacker wishes to target, the attacker needs to control the attack success rate for each model by considering the attack priority for each model. In this paper, we propose a priority adversarial example that considers the attack priority for each model in cases targeting several models. The proposed method controls the attack success rate for each model by adjusting the weight of the attack function in the generation process, while maintaining minimum distortion. We used Tensorflow, a widely used machine learning library, and MNIST as the dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method can control the attack success rate for each model by considering the attack priority of each model while maintaining minimum distortion (on average 3.95 and 2.45 in targeted and untargeted attacks, respectively). © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This is hardly achievable in real test drives alone, but validation with simulated sensors in Virtual Testbeds (VTBs) becomes a popular supplement. To reduce the gap between simulation and reality, Digital Twins of real sensors need to generate data as realistic as possible. Instead of classical methods such as rasterization or ray tracing, a novel approach based on neural networks is developed and evaluated. Based on the concept of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) a classification network is trained to distinguish real from simulated images. At the same time the classifier is used as critic to improve a generation network that refines simulated sensor images to look more realistic. This contribution gives an overview of recent research in image-to-image translation with GANs and suggests a framework to generate more realistic sensor images for-but not limited to-automotive applications. State of the art image-to-image translation architectures are evaluated and several methods are suggested to deal with drawbacks and shortcomings. An evaluation metric according to the subjective assessment of a more realistic color distribution in the refined sensor images is introduced. Finally, the potential of the novel approach to be used in VTBs is analyzed and discussed. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this framework, this paper presents a quantitative assessment of conflict detection performance achievable by different sensing architectures, which can be designed and installed on board of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The attention is focused on non-cooperative systems, which can rely on active sensors (such as radars and LIDARs), passive sensors (such as visual cameras) or multi-sensor-based solutions. The aim is to quantitatively identify the potentialities and limitations of each technological solution. The analysis is carried out by means of a numerical simulation environment able to reproduce horizontal collision scenarios. Specifically, conflict detection performance is expressed in terms of two probabilities, namely the probability of missed conflict detection and false conflict detection, which are evaluated as a function of three parameters which allow uniquely defining the collision scenario, i.e., the time to and distance at the closest point of approach and the azimuth of the intruder with respect to the velocity vector of the ownship. Since, the probability determination process includes the effect of tracking uncertainties (i.e., probability of firm tracking and false track generation), this analysis also allows highlighting the diverse but interconnected effects of sensing accuracy and detection range. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Due to the availability of low-cost GPS jammers in the commercial market, there has been a rising risk of multiple jammers and not just one. However, it is challenging to locate multiple jammers because the traditional jammer localization via multilateration is applicable for only a single jammer case. Also, during a jamming attack, the positioning capability of an on-board GPS receiver is compromised given its inability to track GPS signals. We propose a simultaneous localization of multiple jammers and receivers (SLMR) algorithm by analyzing the variation in the front-end signal power recorded by the GPS receivers on-board a network of UAVs. Our algorithm not only locates multiple jammers but also utilizes these malicious sources as additional navigation signals for positioning the UAVs. We design a Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density filter over a graph framework, which is optimized using a Levenberg-Marquardt minimizer. Using a simulated experimental setup, we validate the convergence and localization accuracy of our SLMR algorithm for various cases, including attacks with a single jammer, multiple jammers, and a varying number of jammers. We also demonstrate that our SLMR algorithm is able to simultaneously locate multiple jammers and UAVs, even for a larger transmitted power of the jammers. © 2014 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Since, a single registration from registration authority, a trusted third party, is sufficient to get mutually authenticated with service providers, onwards. In this paper, we have emphasized only on the MSA-based schemes that do not require online registration authority for mutual authentication. While, considering those MSA schemes, to date, there is no secure and efficient MSA protocol in our observation that is free of all four limitations at the same time, such as 1) free of the hassle of storage of server-based parameters in users' smart card by registration authority, 2) free of the transmission of user-based identities to all servers in a network, 3) free of a single secret key distribution to all servers as assumed in a trusted system, and 4) free from employing costly bilinear pairing operations. In view of those shortcomings, we present an anonymous MSA protocol that nearly counters all those problems using elliptic curve cryptography and escaping costly pairing operations. Our scheme also demonstrates the scheme's robustness using formal security analysis employing random oracle model and automated tool analysis. © 2018 IEEE","Article","Final","Scopus"

The circulation control devices are arranged at the two ends of the wing on an unmanned aerial vehicle scale model, the changes in aerodynamic force and aerodynamic moment caused by turning on the actuator are measured in a wind tunnel, and the flow field characteristics are analysed using particle image velocimetry technology. The flight control effect of the roll attitude is verified via a flight test. Experimental and flight test results show that the control of roll attitude can be achieved by turning on the circulation control actuator on one side, and the maximum efficiency that the circulation control generates is equivalent to 8° aileron deflection with production of a favorable yaw moment to achieve a coordinated turn. The circulation control actuator can increase lift and reduce drag when opened on both sides simultaneously. The maximum lift-to-drag ratio of the UAV increased from 5 to 9, and this approach can also suppress flow separation and delay stall at high angles of attack.

However, there is a growing need for governments to keep malicious UAV communications under legitimate surveillance. This paper first investigates a new surveillance paradigm for monitoring suspicious UAV communications via jamming suspicious UAVs. Due to the power consumption limitation, the choice of eavesdropping and jamming will reflect the performance of the UAVs communication. Therefore, the paper analyses the UAV’s eavesdropping and jamming models in different cases, and then proposes the model to optimize the data package in the constraints of lower power consumption, which can be solved by the proposed selection policy. The simulation results validate our proposed selection policy in terms of power consumption and eavesdropped packets. In different fading models, power consumption increases with time, regardless of distances, and our proposed policy performs better in Weibull fading channels in terms of eavesdropped packets. © 2019 by the authors.

Flow and mixture composition are respectively derived from measurements of the difference and average of sound transit times in two opposite directions in a flowing process gas blend. Gas composition is then determined from an automated comparison of the measured sound velocities with a velocity/composition database. Continuous, real-time precision measurements of binary gas mixtures are required in many applications. While the most natural application of this instrumentation is in the analysis of such mixtures, analysis of mixtures with additional components is also possible, as discussed in this paper. In the ATLAS experiment at CERN, several instruments are presently used in the Detector Control System. Three instruments monitor octafluoropropane (C3F8, R218) and carbon dioxide (CO2, R744) coolant leaks into the nitrogen-purged envelopes surrounding elements of the inner silicon tracker. Precision in molar concentration of better than 2.10−5 is routinely seen in mixtures of C3F8 in nitrogen in the presence of known concentrations of the third party gas CO2. Two further instruments are used to monitor the new 60 kW thermosiphon C3F8 evaporative coolant recirculator which exploits the 90 m depth of the ATLAS pit to circulate coolant without the need for pumps or compressors in the primary loop. These instruments are used to verify the absence of air leaks in the thermosiphon cooling circuit and to measure the vapour-phase coolant flow in real-time. This instrumentation is also used to measure zeotropic fluorocarbon blends containing C3F8 and up to 25% hexafluoroethane (C2F6, R116), achieving a precision around 0.16% in the range 0–25% C2F6. We also report on measurements of heat transfer coefficient in these blends: our experimental data were compared to several empirical correlations, with typical differences less than 10%. This analysis technique, targeting binary pairs of gases of dissimilar molecular weight, is particularly promising for mixtures of anesthetic gases, including in the developing area of anesthesia using xenon.

The interaction among connected entities in this vehicular internet of things (IoT) domain, which also involves smart traffic infrastructure, restaurant beacons, emergency vehicles, etc., offer several real-time applications and provide safer and pleasant driving experience to consumers. With more than 100 million lines of code and hundreds of sensors, these connected vehicles (CVs) expose a large attack surface, which can be remotely compromised and exploited by malicious attackers. Security and privacy are big concerns that deter the adoption of smart cars, which if not properly addressed will have grave implications with risk to human life and limb.

At the same time, the insulator is a serious threat to the safety of the power grid due to the multiple faults of the insulator, and the computer technology should be fully utilized to diagnose the fault. Detection of the insulator images with the complex aerial background is implemented by constructing a convolutional neural network (CNN), which has the classic architecture of five modules of convolution and pooling, two modules of fully connected layers.

However, current technology requires human operation for ethical decision-making, leaving an opportunity to automate some tasks to assist operators. Previously, a University of Virginia capstone team designed an unmanned ground vehicle ('the rover') to aid intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions in adversarial environments. However, a lack of GPS connectivity indoors and system latency limited the rover's performance and created a lag in the operator's view compared to the rover's true position, occasionally causing the operator to inadvertently crash the rover into obstacles. The objectives of this project are to mitigate operational risks by equipping the rover with functionalities to autonomously avoid obstacles, map an unknown indoor space, and navigate itself back to a predetermined location ('base'). Obstacle avoidance is accomplished through an algorithm that stops the rover a safe distance away from a detected obstacle, but still allows the human operator to navigate the rover away from the obstacle prior to continuing the mission. Algorithms are implemented to perform Simultaneous Localization And Mapping and to determine best-route navigation to the base. Laser rangefinder data, an improved processor, and, potentially, visual odometry sensors are used to aid in the navigation algorithms. Testing has confirmed that the rover successfully stops in front of laser-detected obstacles, builds digital maps of an unknown indoor space, and can navigate back to a base, though the performance has room for improvement. It is anticipated that incorporating visual odometry can enhance the rover's mapping implementation and obstacle avoidance performance. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Its seamless integration with the operational system can be quite challenging as it must adhere to the same software requirements such as memory management, latency, and scalability as the rest of the system. Unfortunately, none of these requirements are taken into consideration when inferring new models from data. A straightforward approach for deployment consists of building a pipeline connecting the modeling tools to the operational system. This approach follows a client-server architecture and it may not address the design requirements of the software in production, especially the ones related to efficiency. An alternative is to manually generate the source code implementing the model in the programming language that was originally used to develop the software in production. However, this approach is usually avoided because it is a time-consuming and error-prone task. To circumvent the aforementioned problems, we propose to automate the process of machine learning model deployment. For this, we have developed a special-purpose compiler. Machine learning models can be formally defined using a standard language. We use this formal description as an input for our compiler, which translates it into the source code that implements the model.

Reliable video streaming in NLoS channels over infrastructure-poor ad-hoc radio networks is challenging due to multipath and shadow fading. In this effort, we focus on exploiting the near-ground low-VHF channel which has been shown to have improved penetration, reduced fading, and lower power requirements (which is critical for autonomous agents with limited power) compared to higher frequencies. Specifically, we develop a compact, low-power, low-VHF radio test-bed enabled by recent advances in efficient miniature antennas and off-the-shelf software-defined radios. Our main goal is to carry out an empirical study in realistic environments of how the improved propagation conditions at low-VHF affect the reliability of video-streaming with constraints stemming from the limited available bandwidth with electrically small low-VHF antennas. We show quantitative performance analysis of video streaming from a robotic platform navigating inside a large occupied building received by a node located outdoors: bit error rate (BER) and channel- induced Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) degradation. The results show channel-effect-free- like video streaming with the low-VHF system in complex NLoS channels. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Colonisation prevalence data in Cambodia are lacking. The aim of this study was to determine gastrointestinal colonisation prevalence of ESC-resistant E. coli (ESC-R-EC) and K. pneumoniae (ESC-R-KP) in Cambodian children/adolescents and associated socio-demographic risk factors; and to characterise relevant resistance genes, their genetic contexts, and the genetic relatedness of ESC-R strains using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Results: Faeces and questionnaire data were obtained from individuals < 16 years in north-western Cambodia, 2012. WGS of cultured ESC-R-EC/KP was performed (Illumina). Maximum likelihood phylogenies were used to characterise relatedness of isolates; ESC-R-associated resistance genes and their genetic contexts were identified from de novo assemblies using BLASTn and automated/manual annotation. 82/148 (55%) of children/adolescents were ESC-R-EC/KP colonised; 12/148 (8%) were co-colonised with both species. Independent risk factors for colonisation were hospitalisation (OR: 3.12, 95% CI [1.52-6.38]) and intestinal parasites (OR: 3.11 [1.29-7.51]); school attendance conferred decreased risk (OR: 0.44 [0.21-0.92]. ESC-R strains were diverse; the commonest ESC-R mechanisms were bla CTX-M 1 and 9 sub-family variants. Structures flanking these genes were highly variable, and for bla CTX-M-15, - 55 and - 27 frequently involved IS26. Chromosomal bla CTX-M integration was common in E. coli. Conclusions: Gastrointestinal ESC-R-EC/KP colonisation is widespread in Cambodian children/adolescents; hospital admission and intestinal parasites are independent risk factors. The genetic contexts of bla CTX-M are highly mosaic, consistent with rapid horizontal exchange. Chromosomal integration of bla CTX-M may result in stable propagation in these community-associated pathogens. © 2019 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

Correspondingly, there are many researches and developments for the machine learning. As the evolution of machine learning technology occurs, classification techniques such as image recognition are not as demanding as before. This recognition technique is also important in autonomous vehicle system. For that, we succeeded in training and classifying a few classes (man, car, truck, etc.) in the roadway driving situation using the darkflow which combined the YOLO framework and the tensorflow. In this way, collecting, learning, and recognizing simple objects is relatively easy, but the recognition system for a safe autonomous vehicle system must also be able to recognize certain situations. So we designed the system for training the specific driving conditions on the roadway such as 'Car too close', 'Under the construction', 'People caution' etc. However, it is difficult to gather a lot of specific training data on machine learning. For example, simple forklifts or automobile images on the web can be easily obtained, but data on road construction situation or data on cars just before the crash will be hard to collect.

It can be described as a function of the motivation, opportunity, and capability of the insider. Compared to managing the dimensions of opportunity and capability, assessing one's motivation in committing malicious acts poses more challenges to organizations because it usually involves a more obtrusive process of psychological examination. The existing body of research in psycholinguistics suggests that automated text analysis of electronic communications can be an alternative for predicting and detecting insider threat through unobtrusive behavior monitoring. However, a major challenge in employing this approach is that it is difficult to minimize the risk of missing any potential threat while maintaining an acceptable false alarm rate. To deal with the trade-off between the risk of missed catches and the false alarm rate, we propose a unified psycholinguistic framework that consolidates multiple text analyzers to carry out sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and topic modeling on electronic communications for unobtrusive psychological assessment. The user scenarios presented in this paper demonstrated how the trade-off issue can be attenuated with different text analyzers working collaboratively to provide more comprehensive summaries of users' psychological states. © Sang-Sang Tan, Jin-Cheon Na, Santhiya Duraisamy, 2019.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Criminals or terrorists can potentially use UAVs for committing crimes and terrorism, thus endangering public safety. In this paper, we consider that a legitimate UAV is employed to track flight of suspicious UAVs for preventing safety and security threats. To obtain flight information of the suspicious UAVs, the legitimate UAV intentionally jams the suspicious receiver so as to force the suspicious UAV to reduce its data rate, and hence increase the eavesdropping success. An energy-efficient jamming strategy is proposed for the legitimate UAV to maximize the amount of eavesdropped packets. Moreover, a tracking algorithm is developed for the legitimate UAV to track the suspicious flight by comprehensively utilizing eavesdropped packets, angle-of-arrival and received signal strength of the suspicious transmitter's signal. A new simulation framework is implemented to combine the complementary features of optimization toolbox with channel modeling (in MATLAB) and discrete event-driven mobility tracking (in NS3). Moreover, numerical results validate the proposed algorithms in terms of packet eavesdropping rate and tracking accuracy of the suspicious UAVs' trajectory. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This is achieved by letting the UAV ride existing land public transport such as the city bus throughout the route to its mission location. Indeed, due to their limited battery capacity, micro-UAVs flying time is restrained, which affects their mission and coverage performances. In this paper, we propose to leverage the use of public transport infrastructure, such as city buses, to carry the UAVs whenever it is possible in order to minimize their flight energy consumption. For this purpose, a generic scheduling framework to efficiently cover spatially and temporally distributed events in a geographical area of interest over a long period of time is proposed. By considering the public transport schedule table, a mixed integer linear programming problem (MILP) aiming at minimizing the total energy consumption of the UAVs is formulated while accomplishing all the pre-scheduled missions. The proposed proactive UAV scheduling framework optimizes the UAV trips according to the mission occurrence and the schedule table of the buses. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the collaboration between the UAVs and the land transport to improve the overall UAV missions' performances in terms of distance coverage. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Vehicles tend to have limited processing resources and are energy-constrained. So, any security provision needs to abide by these limitations. At the same time, attacks against vehicles are very rare, often making knowledge-based intrusion detection systems less practical than behaviour-based ones, which is the reverse of what is seen in conventional computing systems. Furthermore, vehicle design and implementation can differ wildly between different types or different manufacturers, which can lead to intrusion detection designs that are vehicle-specific. Equally importantly, vehicles are practically defined by their ability to move, autonomously or not. Movement, as well as other physical manifestations of their operation may allow cyber security breaches to lead to physical damage, but can also be an opportunity for detection. For example, physical sensing can contribute to more accurate or more rapid intrusion detection through observation and analysis of physical manifestations of a security breach. This paper presents a classification and survey of intrusion detection systems designed and evaluated specifically on vehicles and networks of vehicles. Its aim is to help identify existing techniques that can be adopted in the industry, along with their advantages and disadvantages, as well as to identify gaps in the literature, which are attractive and highly meaningful areas of future research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Short survey","Final","Scopus"

Solution alkalinity is an important parameter dictating the corrosion and scaling threat of oilfield brine. However, it remains an ongoing challenge to accurately measure oilfield brine alkalinity, especially in the presence of weak organic acids, such as carboxylic acids. The conventional titration method for oilfield alkalinity measurement does not consider the impact of organic acid on alkalinity, leading to an erroneous measurement result. In this study, an analytical method was presented to simultaneously measure total alkalinity and weak organic acid (acetic acid) concentrations of the brine via an automated titration approach. It shows that the automated method substantially outperformed the conventional method in terms of accurately measuring both solution alkalinity and organic acid concentration with one titration effort. The automated analytical method is considerably robust and is not highly sensitive to the introduction of random error. Modeling calculation shows that the automated analytical method exceeds the conventional method in determining solution alkalinity with an enhanced accuracy for scale threat predictions. This is the first study to report such an accurate and convenient analytical method to measure solution alkalinity and organic acid concentrations for oilfield produced brine. Given the accuracy and convenience of this reported analytical method, it can find wide industrial applications within oilfield and beyond, including corrosion and scaling control, water resource management, and environmental pollution control. © Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Initially, teams of UAVs are moving in a pre-defined formation covering a specified area. When one or more targets are detected, the teams send a package of information to the ground station (GS) including the target's degree of threat, degree of importance, and the separating distance between each team and each detected target. Based on the gathered information, the ground station assigns the teams to the targets. HFLC is implemented in the GS to solve the assignment problem ensuring that each team is assigned to a unique target. Next, each team plans its own path by formulating the path planning problem as an optimization problem. The objective in this case is to minimize the time to reach their destination considering the UAVs dynamic constraints and collision avoidance between teams. A hybrid approach of control parametrization and time discretization (CPTD) and PSO is proposed to solve this optimization problem. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The primary sensor for maritime situation assessment is still the radar, with the AIS being introduced as supplemental service only. In this article, we present a framework to assess the current situation picture based on marine radar image processing. Essentially, the framework comprises a centralized IMM–JPDA multi-target tracker in combination with a fully automated scheme for track management, i.e., target acquisition and track depletion. This tracker is conditioned on measurements extracted from radar images. To gain a more robust and complete situation picture, we are exploiting the aspect angle diversity of multiple marine radars, by fusing them a priori to the tracking process. Due to the generic structure of the proposed framework, different techniques for radar image processing can be implemented and compared, namely the BLOB detector and SExtractor. The overall framework performance in terms of multi-target state estimation will be compared for both methods based on a dedicated measurement campaign in the Baltic Sea with multiple static and mobile targets given. © 2018, CEAS.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, within the next decades, automotive systems with heterogeneous autonomy levels will share the same road network, resulting in new problems for traffic management systems and communication network infrastructure providers. In this paper, we identify key challenges of the upcoming hybrid traffic scenario and present a system-of-systems model, which brings together approaches and methods from traffic modeling, data science, and communication engineering in order to allow data-driven traffic flow optimization. The proposed model consists of data acquisition, data transfer, data analysis, and data exploitation and exploits real world sensor data as well as simulative optimization methods.

Since the data to be handled are very sensitive, the exchange of information over insecure wireless channels can cause serious exposures. The authentication schemes to be employed with sensor networks should be handled with care because of the limited resources and energy available with the sensor nodes. Therefore, this study aims at improving existing authentication schemes by providing protection for healthcare infrastructures against potential, well-known attacks while minimizing the overhead. An anonymous-based user authentication scheme is presented to improve the security features, computation, and communication overhead of the wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme uses improved elliptic curve cryptography and is secure against password guessing attacks and smart card lost/stolen verifier attacks, and also preserves user anonymity. Through the formal and informal security analyses, it is shown that the proposed scheme is secure against possible known attacks, including the password guessing attacks and smart card lost/stolen verifier attacks, and that it also preserves the user anonymity property. In addition, for the formal security verification, the proposed scheme is simulated using the widely accepted automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool. The proposed scheme provides high security along with incurring low computational and communication costs. © 2017 IEEE","Article","Final","Scopus"

Probabilistic models, such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), have been successfully applied to this end given their ability to exploit contextual and situation information, e.g. a bowl is typically found in a cabinet and not in a night-stand. In this work we propose to evolve CRFs into Ontology-based Conditional Random Fields (obCRFs), which define a multi-level structure where each level assigns a category with different granularity to the same set of objects. For example, a level could assign to an object the category appliance or furniture, while the next one could categorize it into the tv, microwave, cabinet, or table types. In this way, general categorizations can guide the classification into more specialized ones (and vice versa), improving recognition success, and mitigating the CRFs limitations when modeling a high number of object categories (shared, in general, by Machine Learning techniques). To set the categories in each level we propose to mimic the hierarchical structure of ontologies, where categories are naturally codified following a subsumption ordering. This leads us to the second advantage of obCRFs: the multi-labeling of objects provides a richer understanding of the scene, which can be leveraged for accomplishing high-level tasks (e.g. object search or scheduling). Our approach has been tested with scenes from two state-of-the-art datasets: Robot@Home and Cornell-RGBD, outperforming the results provided by standard CRFs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Many driving assistant techniques, embedded in several vehicles, are helping drivers to avoid car crashes by giving them early warning message. In this work, An Intelligent Road Crashes Avoidance (IRCA) system which adopts the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Decision Tree (DT) algorithms is proposed. The prediction model of IRCA is trained using big dataset composed of 1.6 million rows (car accidents) and 23 features (information) spanning over 14 years of data collection by United Kingdom (UK). With prediction accuracy of 72% for ANN and 74% for TD algorithms, IRCA system can predict car crash risk levels for 941 districts of UK. IRCA system can be exploited either in human-driven or in self-driving cars. The prediction accuracy can further be improved by training on new collected dataset with less missing data and outliers. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Designers usually choose the airfoil having the best performance for the cruise mode only or being able to stay suboptimal for all the flight regimes. It leads to a reduction in the maximum lift-to-drag ratio for certain regimes, as well as deterioration in the overall performance. That is why the adaptive wing with its ability to stay optimal for any of the flight regimes is a promising technology which could significantly improve the performance and maneuverability of the aircraft during the flight. In this work, we assess the performance of the wing with the traditional and adaptive mechanization of the flap and slat using computer simulation followed by the experiments in the wind tunnel environment. This work also provides the design of an adaptive wing with an adaptive flap and slat. All the investigations were performed for the two-dimensional airfoil under different Reynolds numbers and AoA. This paper demonstrates that an adaptive wing improves the lift-to-drag ratio and maneuverability of the aircraft for different flight regimes. The application of the adaptive wing mechanization could improve the lift-to-drag ratio by 20%-30% for certain regimes, thereby improving the range and time of operation. © 2019 Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

Methods Antimicobial susceptibility testing (AST) was carried out for the clinical isolates from 49 hospitals (including 30 tertiary hospitals and 19 secondary hospitals, according to a unified protocol using Kirby-Bauer method or automated AST systems. Results were analyzed according to CLSI 2017 breakpoints. Results Of the 134 078 clinical isolates, gram-positive cocci and gramnegative bacilli accounted for 30.0% (40 243/134 078) and 70.0% (93 835/134 078), respectively. Overall, 29.0% of the isolates were from secondary hospitals, 71.0% from tertiary hospitals. The overall prevalence of MRSA in Staphylococcus aureus was 49.1% and 79.7% for MRCNS in coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. The average prevalence of MRSA and MRCNS was 53.2% and 72.1% in secondary hospitals, 47.7% and 82.2% in tertiary hospitals. No strains were found resistant to vancomycin in Staphylococcus spp. About 84.3% of the 1 041 strains of non-meningitis S. pneumoniae isolated from children were penicillin-susceptible (PSSP), 15.7% were penicillin-nonsusceptible, including penicillin-intermediate (PISP, 7.8%) and penicillin-resistant (PRSP, 7.9%) strains. Of the 330 strains isolated from adults, 89.4%, 4.2% and 6.4% were PSSP, PISP and PRSP, respectively. Overall, 64 (1.2%) strains of vacomycin-resistant E. feacium and 5 (0.1%) strains of vacomycin-resistant E. feacalis were identified. According to PCR results, most of these resistant strains were vanA genotype. The overall prevalence of ESBLs-producing srains was 54.9% in E. coli, 35.1% in Klebsiella pneumoniae and 47.6% in Proteus mirabilis. Specifically, the prevalence of such strains was 53.7%, 31.5%, and 44.0% in secondary hospitals; 55.5%, 37.0% and 50.0% in tertiary hospitals, respectively. Enterobacteriaceae strains were still highly susceptible to carbapenems.

Traditional standalone systems are now becoming more sophisticated, resulting in more distributed interfaces, and a larger attack surface. As such, there now exists a tightly coupled cyber-physical nature that makes a cyber-attack capable of not only exfiltrating sensitive data, but also manipulating safety-critical operations of the system. This manipulation can cause the train to experience unsafe conditions, potentially leading to derailments, explosions, and collisions. This makes it as important as ever to build in security and resilience at the earliest stages of design, making deployment infrastructure more safe, reliable, and predictable in a compromising environment. In this poster we demonstrate how to analyze the security and resilience of railway infrastructure by utilizing a domain specific simlation based framework. Our framework includes a simulation cluster with both transportation and network modeling capabilities, a graphical design studio to rapidly develop attack scenarios againt railway networks, and a results dashboard that includes real time visualization of various metrics. Additionally, we not only support software-in-the-loop, but have integrated a hardware-in-the-loop testbed to test realistic attacks that occur within the deployment environment. We illustrate the capabilities of our developed framework with a connected railway case study of the Washington D.C Metro rail network. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Once the wireless network is introduced by each vehicle to exchange information, it is vulnerable to cyber attacks, making attack detection necessary.

In this context, one popular trend is for urban planar structures recognition (floor/ground recognition), because they have consistent appearance under urban scenarios and they can be used to improve several computer vision applications performance, for example, in autonomous vehicle navigation, robotic control, 3D modeling, etc. In the current literature, there are several approaches for floor recognition. However, most previous work has low robustness under image degradations (blur, lighting changes, noise, etc.). One alternative to address the image degradation problems is the use of binary features (for example LBP features). In this work, we propose a new binary-patterns based floor recognition suitable for urban scenes. For that, we propose two analyses, first we consider the floor connection to increase the recognition and second we segment the recognition in floor surface sets to remove the floor misrecognition. Finally, experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method delivers high stability under different scenes and it has more recognition than previous work under floor recognition domain. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In spite of the widespread presence of such hydraulic structures in steep mountain streams worldwide, there are still few studies monitoring the effects of check dams on sediment dynamics. The use of repeated topographic surveys allows us to characterize debris-flow activity at multiple temporal and spatial scales and its interaction with torrent control works. Structure from Motion (SfM) technique paired with Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithms represents a low-cost opportunity to conduct such multi-temporal surveys. This enables us to better study the effects of individual debris flows, track geomorphic changes and evaluate the effectiveness of torrent control works (e.g. check dams). The effect of check dams on sediment dynamics is investigated by means of multi-temporal topographic surveys before and after debris-flow events in the Moscardo torrent (eastern Italian Alps) where two check dams have recently been built. Multi-temporal SfM based on images taken from the ground in combination with imagery taken by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is used to obtain DEMs and to study topographic changes through the comparison of repeat DEMs (DEM of Difference, i.e. DoD). The results show that the new check dams considerably modified sediment dynamics in the studied channel but their performance cannot be considered satisfactory. The sediment flowed around the upstream check dam on the right wing, while deep erosion observed downstream of the check dam threatened to undermine the foundation's stability. Moreover, debris-flow lobes deposited upstream of the check dams could act as sources of sediment further increasing downstream debris-flow volume. The analysis proposed in this work could help improve design strategies and permitting the identification of a proper site for check dam building. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Taking the Spanish agricultural sector—specifically the area of Campo de Dalías in Almería where much of Europe's vegetables are grown—as a case, we find that labour exploitation flourishes in communities of like-minded companies that do not care about mainstream norms. We confirm which socio-economic aspects of labour demand/supply lead to slavery, while challenging the assumption that markets which are dominated by few employers are more prone to exploiting workers. We find that, regarding isolation and connectedness of employers, cluster effects and intense inter-employer communication are particularly effective drivers of underpayment if the cluster is homogenous in terms of wage level and if it is isolated from law-abiding employers. This means that employers tend to confirm and reinforce each other in their illegal behaviour, thus creating enclaves in which non-standard norms prevail and worker exploitation is regarded as legitimate. On the other hand, we see that breaking the isolation of employees among each other only increases pay levels if there are law-abiding employers, pointing to the potentially beneficial role social business and entrepreneurs, state-owned companies, or public entrepreneurs could play for transforming labour conditions of entire markets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

The problem is that end users have a hard time assessing the risks induced by connected devices, and often lack the skills and time to administrate their home network. We answer the above challenge by proposing STewARD, a solution that allows users to easily request from their intelligent home network controller the creation of isolated software-defined network slices, to which they assign a required trust level using very simple risk assessment.

The necessity of better surveillance in these places pushed the development of new automated solutions to spot and notify possible menaces as fast as possible. In this work, we propose a novel approach to create a decentralized architecture to manage patrolling drones and cameras exploiting lightweight protocols used in the internet of things (IoT) domain. Through the adoption of the mist computing paradigm it is possible to give to all the object of the smart ecosystem a cognitive intelligence to speed up the recognition and analysis tasks. Distributing the intelligence among all the objects of the surveillance ecosystem allows a faster recognition and reaction to possible warning situations. The recognition of unusual objects in certain areas, e.g., airports, train stations and bus stations, has been made using computer vision algorithms. The adoption of the IoT protocols in a hierarchical architecture provides high scalability allowing an easy and painless join of other smart objects. Also a study on the soft real-time feasibility has been conducted and is herein presented. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Article","Final","Scopus"

AVs are a complex system composed of many subsystems, making them a typical target for attackers. Therefore, the firmware of the different subsystems needs to be updated to the latest version by the manufacturer to fix bugs and introduce new features, e.g., using security patches. In this paper, we propose a distributed firmware update scheme for the AVs' subsystems, leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology. A consortium blockchain made of different AVs manufacturers is used to ensure the authenticity and integrity of firmware updates. Instead of depending on centralized third parties to distribute the new updates, we enable AVs, namely distributors, to participate in the distribution process and we take advantage of their mobility to guarantee high availability and fast delivery of the updates. To incentivize AVs to distribute the updates, a reward system is established that maintains a credit reputation for each distributor account in the blockchain. A zero-knowledge proof protocol is used to exchange the update in return for a proof of distribution in a trustless environment. Moreover, we use attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme to ensure that only authorized AVs will be able to download and use a new update. Our analysis indicates that the additional cryptography primitives and exchanged transactions do not affect the operation of the AVs network. Also, our security analysis demonstrates that our scheme is efficient and secure against different attacks. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

On the other hand, it triggers serious risks on vehicle theft and location privacy leakage. To address these issues, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving automated valet parking protocol for self-driving vehicles. The proposed protocol is characterized by extending anonymous authentication to support two-factor authentication with mutual traceability for reducing the risks of vehicle theft and preventing the privacy leakage of users in automated valet parking. Specifically, based on one-time password and secure mobile devices, two-factor authentication is achieved between vehicles and smartphones to ensure vehicle security in remote pickup. By exploiting the BBS+ signature and the Cuckoo filter, user location privacy is protected against the curious parking lots and service providers. In addition, the traceable tags are designed to enable a trusted authority to identify the vehicles and users for localizing a stolen or missing vehicle and preventing the slandering of greedy users. Finally, formal security analysis on the proposed protocol is given to show that the authentication, anonymity, and traceability can be reduced to standard hard assumptions, and performance evaluation demonstrates the proposed protocol is efficient and practical to be implemented in autonomous driving era. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To carry out these large-scale tasks, the analyst will have to perform 100 or more SQLi penetration tests on one or more target. This makes the process much more complex and much harder to implement. This paper attempts to compare large-scale SQL injections performed with Manual Methods, which is the benchmark, and the proposed SQLiAutoScript Method. The SQLiAutoScript method uses sqlmap as a tool, in combination with sqlmap scripting and logging features, to facilitate a more effective and manageable approach within a large scale of hundreds or thousands of SQL injection penetration tests. Comparison of the test results for both Manual and SQLiAutoScript approaches and their benefits is included in the comparative analysis. The tests were performed over a scope of 24 SQL injection (SQLi) tests that comprises over 100,000 HTTP requests and injections, and within a total testing run-time period of about 50 hours. The scope of testing also covers both SQLiAutoScript and Manual methods. In the SQLiAutoScript method, each SQL injection test has its own sub-folder and files for data such as results (output), progress (traffic logs) and logging. In this way across all SQLi tests, the results, data and details related to SQLi tests are logged, available, traceable, accurate and not missed out. Available and traceable data also facilitates traceability of failed SQLi tests, and higher recovery and reruns of failed SQLi tests to maximize increased attack surface upon the target. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The treat is more serious in developing countries due to inappropriate use, poor adherence, use of counterfeit, sub-standard antibiotics and poor infection control practices. Data on ESBL producing Gram-negative bacteria are limited in developing countries including Ethiopia. The aim of this study was therefore, to describe the burden of ESBL producing Gram negative pathogens isolated from patients attending at Felege Hiwot Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Bahir Dar, Amhara region. Materials and methods A total of 532 clinical samples of blood, urine, stool, wound, abscess, ear discharge, nasal discharge, cervical discharge and body fluid specimens were aseptically collected and bacteriologically processed. Identification of the bacterial species was performed using an automated system (Vitek-2 Compact 27530, USA) and antibiotic susceptibility test was determined by disk diffusion method and selection of antibiotics were in accordance with CLSI guidelines. The MDR pattern of the Gram-negative pathogens was assessed using phenotypic methods of ESBL and carbapenemase production following standard procedure. Result A total of 532 samples were processed and 263 pathogens were isolated. Of these, 185 (70.3%) were Gram-negative and 78 (29.7%) Gram-positive. Of the Gram-negative bacteria the high proportion of the isolates were identified from blood 146/185 (78.9%) and 29/185 (15.7%) were from urine cultures. The most common isolate in all clinical samples was Klebsiella pneumoniae 97/185 (52.4%) followed by Escherichia coli 23/185 (12.4%), Acinetobacter baumannii 15/185 (17.6%) and Enterobacter aerogenes 12/185(6.5%). Of the total Gram negatives, the prevalence of MDR was 148/185 (80.0%). Of the MDR isolates the prevalence of ESBL producers were, 127/148 (85.8%) and 24/148 (16.2%) were carbapenemase producers. Conclusion and recommendation Prevalence of MDR and ESBL producing Gram-negative pathogens in this hospital is alarmingly high. Therefore, continuous monitoring of the problem with effective infection prevention and careful selection of empirical therapy are warranted in the study area. © 2019 Moges et al.

However, with the increasing use of Electronic Control Units (ECU) to mount vehicular E/E systems, the cyber threats are also increasing. Vehicular security is a very important function which is directly connected to lives of drivers and passengers. Hence, modern vehicles should be provided with an information security function. In case that autonomous vehicles are commercialized in the future, an evaluation methodology will be needed to check if vehicles are normally provided with an information security function. In this paper, we propose a security evaluation methodology and tool that can analyze the security level of In-vehicle network without the information provided by the vehicle manufacturer. The proposed evaluation methodology is designed based on four types of attacks that can be performed on In-vehicle Controller Area Network (CAN). In addition, we design and develop the evaluation tool that can measure changes in vehicle conditions using various sensors. Finally, we conduct experiments using actual vehicles to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.

To further increase the versatility of quadrotors, recent works investigated the use of an adaptive morphology, which consists of modifying the shape of the vehicle during flight to suit a specific task or environment. However, these works either increase the complexity of the platform or decrease its controllability. In this letter, we propose a novel, simpler, yet effective morphing design for quadrotors consisting of a frame with four independently rotating arms that fold around the main frame. To guarantee stable flight at all times, we exploit an optimal control strategy that adapts on the fly to the drone morphology. We demonstrate the versatility of the proposed adaptive morphology in different tasks, such as negotiation of narrow gaps, close inspection of vertical surfaces, and object grasping and transportation. The experiments are performed on an actual, fully autonomous quadrotor relying solely on onboard visual-inertial sensors and compute. No external motion tracking systems and computers are used.

Increasing the reliability of these vehicles on the road requires an extensive suite of software tests, ideally performed on highfidelity simulators, where multiple vehicles and pedestrians interact with the self-driving vehicle. It is therefore of critical importance to ensure that self-driving software is assessed against a wide range of challenging simulated driving scenarios. The state of the art in driving scenario generation, as adopted by some of the front-runners of the self-driving car industry, still relies on human input [1]. In this paper we propose to automate the process using Bayesian optimization to generate adversarial self-driving scenarios that expose poorly-engineered or poorly-trained self-driving policies, and increase the risk of collision with simulated pedestrians and vehicles. We show that by incorporating the generated scenarios into the training set of the self-driving policy, and by fine-tuning the policy using vision-based imitation learning we obtain safer self-driving behavior. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

For autonomous vehicles and robotics the use of LiDAR is indispensable in order to achieve precise depth predictions. A multitude of applications depend on the awareness of their surroundings, and use depth cues to reason and react accordingly. On the one hand, monocular depth prediction methods fail to generate absolute and precise depth maps. On the other hand, stereoscopic approaches are still significantly outperformed by LiDAR based approaches. The goal of the depth completion task is to generate dense depth predictions from sparse and irregular point clouds which are mapped to a 2D plane. We propose a new framework which extracts both global and local information in order to produce proper depth maps. We argue that simple depth completion does not require a deep network. However, we additionally propose a fusion method with RGB guidance from a monocular camera in order to leverage object information and to correct mistakes in the sparse input. This improves the accuracy significantly. Moreover, confidence masks are exploited in order to take into account the uncertainty in the depth predictions from each modality. This fusion method outperforms the state-of-the-art and ranks first on the KITTI depth completion benchmark [21].

Methods: We create a multimodal cardiac motion atlas from three-dimensional (3-D) MR and 3-D US data followed by multi-view machine learning algorithms to combine and extract the most meaningful cardiac descriptors for classification of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients using US data only. More specifically, we propose two algorithms based on multi-view linear discriminant analysis and multi-view Laplacian support vector machines (MvLapSVMs). Furthermore, a novel regional multi-view approach is proposed to exploit the regional relationships between the two modalities. Results: We evaluate our pipeline on the classification task of discriminating between normals and DCM patients. Results show that the use of multi-view classifiers together with a cardiac motion atlas results in a statistically significant improvement in accuracy compared to classification without the multimodal atlas. MvLapSVM was able to achieve the highest accuracy for both the global approach (92.71%) and the regional approach (94.32%).

In practice, Low-Resolution (LR) images or videos are widely used in surveillance systems. In low resolution surveillance systems, the car plate text is often illegible. Super-Resolution (SR) techniques can be used to improve the car plate quality by processing a series of LR images into a single High-Resolution (HR) image. Recovering the HR image from a single LR is still an ill-conditioned problem for SR. Previous methods always minimize the mean square loss in order to improve the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). However, minimizing the mean square loss leads to overly smoothed reconstructed image. In this paper, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based SR is proposed to reconstruct the LR images into HR images. Besides that, perceptual loss is proposed to solve the smoothing issue. The quality of the GAN based SR generated images is compared to existing techniques such as bicubic, nearest and Super-Resolution Convolution Neural Network (SRCNN). The results show that the reconstructed images using GANs based SR achieve better results in term of perceptual quality compared to previous methods. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

First of all, the constant increase in vehicles, and at the same time the reduction, for budget reasons, of the number of free parking areas more or less easily reached. Moreover, due to global events such as the economic crisis, there is a general reduction in the efficiency of local public transport. In this research, we present an approach to this problem that exploits the greater availability of IT structures and devices. The solution presented offers the possibility of improving one of the most burdensome aspects, namely the traffic generated by cars looking for a parking space through an integrated and automatic management of employment levels. The procedure is based on wireless smart cameras for monitoring public outdoor parking areas. The main strengths of this solution lie in the independence and scalability of the proposed architecture. Independence is ensured by the node's modus operandi, in which processing is performed on board the intelligent camera without the need for a video stream or operator intervention. Scalability can be achieved by designing low-cost nodes that can be connected in a sensor network that does not require high installation costs. Moreover, the possibility of making such processing nodes autonomous through the use of a photovoltaic panel allows them to be installed in even more flimsy situations. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, a structure level UAS collision ground test was performed on a commercial airliner horizontal stabilizer section to investigate the dynamic response of this primary operation component. The projectile was a 3.4 kg quadcopter named ‘Inspire I’. Explicit dynamic code PAM-CRASHR was employed to simulate the collision process and the modeling procedures were modified through comparison with test data, followed by series of simulations to assess the hazard of different collision scenarios. The results showed that 3.4 kg drone impact at the airliner cruising speed could cause some damage on the horizontal stabilizer front spar and the situation is more serious than 3.6 kg bird strike in which the hardness of drone components rather than kinetic energy is a decisive factor. The lithium-ion battery penetrated into the airframe had a smoke sign in the test, which might be a potential ignition source. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

Yet a rising level of anthropogenic threats makes data collection ever more urgent. Currently, modern underwater sampling tools, particularly autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), are able to collect vast image data, but cannot bypass the bottleneck formed by manual image annotation. Computer vision (CV) offers a faster, more consistent, cost effective and sharable alternative to manual annotation. We used TensorFlow to evaluate the performance of the Inception V3 model with different numbers of training images, as well as assessing how many different classes (taxa) it could distinguish. Classifiers (models) were trained with increasing amounts of data (20 to 1000 images of each taxa) and increasing numbers of taxa (7 to 52). Maximum performance (0.78 sensitivity, 0.75 precision) was achieved using the maximum number of training images but little was gained in performance beyond 200 training images. Performance was also highest with the least classes in training. None of the classifiers had average performances high enough to be a suitable alternative to manual annotation. However, some classifiers performed well for individual taxa (0.95 sensitivity, 0.94 precision). Our results suggest this technology is currently best applied to specific taxa that can be reliably identified and where 200 training images offers a good compromise between performance and annotation effort. This demonstrates that CV could be routinely employed as a tool to study benthic ecology by non-specialists, which could lead to a major increase in data availability for conservation research and biodiversity management. © Inter-Research 2019 ·","Article","Final","Scopus"

According to the current functional safety standard, controllability, largely affected by human intervention, is a large contributor to the definition of the Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL). Since the driver involvement in CAVs will decrease in future, this gives no clear definition for future functional safety design. On the other hand, CAVs bring additional capabilities such as advance sensors, telematics-based connectivity etc. which can be used to devise efficient approaches to address functional safety (FuSa) challenges. The caveat to these additional capabilities is issues like cybersecurity, complexity, etc. This paper is an exploration into FuSa and CAVs and will present a systematic approach to understand challenges and propose potential framework, Intelligent Vehicle Monitoring for Safety and Security (IVMSS) to handle faults/malfunctions in CAVs, and specifically autonomous systems. Autonomous algorithms may be model-based for the on-board systems (e.g. motors, sensors etc.) or machine learning based algorithms can be used to diagnose the processes' malfunction (E.g. lane changing, overtaking, following the speed limits, parking, etc.) in CAVs. The goal of the framework is to deal with the functional safety challenges when the driver is not in the feedback loop. The additional set of sensors and connectivity can be used to develop IVMSS algorithms. With the advent of connected vehicles security also needs to be assessed, in fact it will be shown that safety is a subset of security. These threats can cause great risk to safety critical systems and thus be explored as well. The framework will build upon the lessons learned from current L2 technology out on the roads. © 2019 SAE International. All Rights Reserved.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The main idea of this study is to exploit the advantages of the linear parameter varying (LPV) control approach together with a feedback linearisation approach for designing a cascade control structure without the need to perform simplifications with respect to the reference dynamic model used in the literature. The use of a LPV representation of the attitude subsystem allows to consider it as independent of the position one, allowing the use of a cascade control structure. For the inner attitude control loop, the proposed quasi-LPV–linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) controller and proportional–integral observer (PIO) are solved in an optimal manner by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). While for the outer position control loop, a feedback linearisation approach is developed before designing the corresponding controller and PIO also minimising the LQR problem by means of LMIs. Furthermore, another outer loop, interchangeable with the position one, such that controls the velocities in the body frame is proposed. This velocities controller is also solved in an optimal manner using a combination of feedback linearisation and LPV techniques. The proposed solutions are applied to an AscTec Hummingbird unmanned aerial vehicle in simulation. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019","Article","Final","Scopus"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Retinal images of people with type 2 diabetes visiting a primary care screening program were graded by a hybrid deep learning–enhanced device (IDx-DR-EU-2.1; IDx, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), and its classification of retinopathy (vision-threatening [vt]DR, more than mild [mtm]DR, and mild or more [mom]DR) was compared with a reference standard. This reference standard consisted of grading according to the International Clinical Classification of DR by the Rotterdam Study reading center. We determined the diagnostic accuracy of the hybrid deep learning–enhanced device (IDx-DR-EU-2.1) against the reference standard. RESULTS A total of 1,616 people with type 2 diabetes were imaged. The hybrid deep learning–enhanced device’s sensitivity/specificity against the reference standard was, respectively, for vtDR 100% (95% CI 77.1–100)/97.8% (95% CI 96.8–98.5) and for mtmDR 79.4% (95% CI 66.5–87.9)/93.8% (95% CI 92.1–94.9). CONCLUSIONS The hybrid deep learning–enhanced device had high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of both vtDR (although the number of vtDR cases was low) and mtmDR in a primary care setting against an independent reading center.

A known problem, though, is that policies overfit to the training environment and may not avoid rare, catastrophic events such as automotive accidents. A classical technique for improving the robustness of reinforcement learning algorithms is to train on a set of randomized environments, but this approach only guards against common situations. Recently, robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL) was developed, which allows efficient applications of random and systematic perturbations by a trained adversary. A limitation of RARL is that only the expected control objective is optimized; there is no explicit modeling or optimization of risk. Thus the agents do not consider the probability of catastrophic events (i.e., those inducing abnormally large negative reward), except through their effect on the expected objective. In this paper we introduce risk-averse robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARARL), using a risk-averse protagonist and a risk-seeking adversary. We test our approach on a self-driving vehicle controller. We use an ensemble of policy networks to model risk as the variance of value functions. We show through experiments that a risk-averse agent is better equipped to handle a risk-seeking adversary, and experiences substantially fewer crashes compared to agents trained without an adversary.

Methods: This prospective study included 114 patients (75 men, 39 women; mean age 51.3 ± 14.7 years, range: 18–90 years) who underwent PET/CT-guided biopsy of FDG-avid abdominal and pelvic lesions from October 2014 to December 2017. Of these patients, 54 had a prior inconclusive CT-guided biopsy. The biopsies were done with ARA assistance, and a real-time sample was obtained after confirming the position of the needle tip within the target lesion on PET/CT. Histopathology reports were reviewed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the procedure. Clinical or imaging follow-up was done to confirm negative results. Results: The lesions were successfully targeted in 110 of the 114 patients (96.5%) and yielded a pathological diagnosis. Pathological diagnoses were confirmed in 50 of the 54 patients with a prior inconclusive biopsy. Of the 110 lesions, 82 were malignant, 20 were benign, and 8 showed minimal residual FDG uptake at the end of treatment and had no active disease even on clinical and imaging follow-up of at least 3 months. Findings were true-positive in 102 lesions, false-positive in none, true-negative in eight and false-negative in four. The procedure showed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of 96.2%, 100%, 100%, 66.7 and 96.5%, respectively. No immediate complications or delayed life-threatening events were observed. Conclusion: Percutaneous biopsy of metabolically active abdominal and pelvic lesions with ARA assistance is a technically feasible, safe and accurate method for pathological diagnosis with high diagnostic performance. PET-guided biopsy is highly practical and useful in patients, especially in those with a previous inconclusive biopsy.                          © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This problem which tends to increase continuously has now reached a global dimension. In this study, 252 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) isolates obtained between January 2010 and December 2016 were analyzed retrospectively and primary and secondary resistance status against first-line anti-TB drugs (isoniazid [INH], rifampicin [RIF], streptomycin [SM], ethambutol [EMB] has been evaluated. Material and Method: Sterile body fluids from clinical specimens accepted and examined directly in the mycobacteriology laboratory; the contaminant clinical samples were firstly subjected to homogenization and decontamination by the N-acetyl-L-cysteine-sodium hydroxide method, followed by culture and antibiotic susceptibility status with the BACTEC MGIT fully automated system Results: Seventy (27.8%) of isolates were found to be resistant to at least one of the four anti-TB drugs. Isolates showing single or combined drug resistance for INH, SM, RIF and EMB were 20.6% (n=52), 12.3% (n=31), 7.5% (n=19) and 6.7% (n=17) respectively. Single drug resistance was detected in 42 (16.7%) isolates. INH, EMB, SM and RIF resistance rates were 9.5% (n=24), 4.0% (n=10), 2.8% (n=7) and 0.4% (n=1) respectively. Eighteen (7.1%) isolates were found to be multidrug resistant (MDR) TB strains. We have more than one resistant strain isolate except MDR-TB strain, 4% (n=10). The rate of resistance to all drugs was 1.6% (n=4). Conclusion: In our study, it is striking that INH resistance is found entirely in at least two drug resistant isolates (n=28) and also in 20.6% of isolates, INH resistance is detected. This result shows that one of every five isolates is resistant to INH. Therefore, maximum protection of the RIF is necessary to prevent further MDR-TB problems in our hospital. Although our MDRTB rates tend to decrease by percentage through previous years, increasing and facilitating travel from countries with high MDR-TB rates to our country and recent increase in immigration numbers from countries in civil war seem to be again growing problem for drug resistant TB and MDR-TB. © 2019, Nobelmedicus.

Since directional communications in vehicular scenarios are severely hindered by beam pointing issues, a beam alignment procedure has to be periodically carried out to guarantee the communication reliability. When dealing with massive MIMO links, the beam sweeping approach is known to be time consuming and often unfeasible due to latency constraints. To speed up the process, we propose a method that exploits a-priori information on array dynamics provided by an inertial sensor on transceivers to assist the beam alignment procedure. The proposed inertial sensor aided technique allows a continuous tracking of the beam while transmitting, avoiding frequent realignment phases. Numerical results based on real measurements of on-transceiver accelerometers demonstrate a significant gain in terms of V2V communication throughput with respect to conventional beam alignment protocols. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

While modern compilers provide .ags to activate di.erent optimizations to improve performance, the e.ectiveness of such automated optimization depends on the algorithm and its mapping to the underlying accelerator architecture. Currently, however, extracting the best performance from an algorithm on an accelerator requires signi.cant expertise and manual effort to exploit both spatial and temporal sharing of computing resources in order to improve overall performance. In particular, maximizing the performance on an algorithm on an accelerator requires extensive hyperparameter (e.g., thread-block size) selection and tuning. Given the myriad of hyperparameter dimensions to optimize across, the search space of optimizations is generally extremely large, making it infeasible to exhaustively evaluate each optimization configuration. This paper proposes an approach that uses statistical analysis with iterative machine learning (IterML) to prune and tune hyperparameters to achieve better performance. During each iteration, we leverage machine-learning (ML) models to provide pruning and tuning guidance for the subsequent iterations.

Owing to their flexibility in flight scheduling, high spatial resolution, and costs-effectiveness, UAVs have become a popular tool for monitoring dynamic environmental processes, such as emergence and outbreak of harmful algae blooms (HABs). The HABs outbreak, often linked with anthropogenic eutrophication, has become a serious environmental health problem that threats our communities. Existing studies show that UAV-based HABs monitoring is a cost-effective means of assisting environmental managers in developing precautionary warning system and coping strategies.

A bird's eye view of the scene, including occupancy and velocity, is fed as a sequence to a RNN which is trained to predict future occupancy. The nature of prediction allows generation of multiple hours of training data without the need of manual labeling. Thus, the training strategy and loss function are designed for long sequences of real-world data (unbalanced, continuously changing situations, false labels, etc.). The deep CNN architecture comprises convolutional long short-term memories (ConvLSTMs) to separate static from dynamic regions and to predict dynamic objects in future frames. Novel recurrent skip connections show the ability to predict small occluded objects, i.e. pedestrians, and occluded static regions. Spatio-temporal correlations between grid cells are exploited to predict multimodal future paths and interactions between objects.

The on-going miniaturization of sensors, actuators, and processors with ubiquitous wireless connectivity makes drones to be used in a wide range of applications ranging from military to civilian. Since most of the applications involved in the IoD are real-time based, the users are generally interested in accessing real-time information from drones belonging to a particular fly zone. This happens if we allow users to directly access real-time data from flying drones inside IoD environment and not from the server. This is a serious security breach which may deteriorate performance of any implemented solution in this IoD environment. To address this important issue in IoD, we propose a novel lightweight user authentication scheme in which a user in the IoD environment needs to access data directly from a drone provided that the user is authorized to access the data from that drone. The formal security verification using the broadly accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool along with informal security analysis show that our scheme is secure against several known attacks. The performance comparison demonstrates that our scheme is efficient with respect to various parameters, and it provides better security as compared to those for the related existing schemes.

Meanwhile, UAV aided underlay device-to-device (D2D) communication mode can be activated for further improving the capacity of the 5G networks. However, this UAV aided D2D communication system is more vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, resulting in security risks. In this paper, the D2D receivers work in full-duplex (FD) mode, which improves the security of the network by enabling these legitimate users to receive their useful information and transmit jamming signal to the eavesdropper simultaneously (with the same frequency band). The security communication under the UAV coverage is evaluated, showing that the system’s (security) capacity can be substantially improved by taking advantage of the flexible radio coverage of UAVs. Furthermore, the closed-form expressions for the coverage probabilities are derived, showing that the cellular users (CUs)’ secure coverage probability in downlink transmission is mainly impacted by the following three factors: Its communication area, the relative position with UAV, and its eavesdroppers. In addition, it is observed that the D2D users or DUs’ secure coverage probability is relevant to state of the UAV.

We consider a team of USVs used in the protection of a target against potential threats. The task of the USVs is to cooperatively protect the target from being destroyed. A behavior-based fuzzy logic control system is presented to solve the problem. First, we identify two types of behaviors; low and high level behaviors. High level behaviors act as a mechanism to induced coordination and synchronization among USVs. Based on this, four high level behaviors (behavior integrator, intercept, formation and assist behaviors), each implementing a fuzzy inference system and two low level behaviors(collision avoidance and attack behaviors) are proposed. The paper defines behavior-based rules to meet the requirement of a simple operational scenario. Genetic algorithms is used to learn the rule base and the choice of behavior. Simulation results demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

The UAV employs the radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) to charge the users in the downlink, and the users use the harvested RF energy to send independent information to the UAV in the uplink. Unlike the conventional WPCN with fixed APs, the UAV-enabled WPCN can exploit the mobility of the UAV via trajectory design, jointly with the wireless resource allocation optimization, to maximize the system throughput. In particular, we aim to maximize the uplink common (minimum) throughput among all ground users over a finite UAV's flight period, subject to its maximum speed constraint and the users' energy neutrality constraints. The resulted problem is nonconvex and thus difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this challenge, we first consider an ideal case without the UAV's maximum speed constraint, and obtain the optimal solution to the relaxed problem. The optimal solution shows that the UAV should successively hover above a finite number of ground locations for downlink WPT, as well as above each of the ground users for uplink communication. Next, we consider the general problem with the UAV's maximum speed constraint. Based on the above multilocation-hovering solution, we first propose an efficient successive hover-and-fly trajectory design, jointly with the downlink and uplink wireless resource allocation, and then propose a locally optimal solution by applying the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex programming (SCP). Numerical results show that the proposed UAV-enabled WPCN achieves significant throughput gains over the conventional WPCN with fixed-location AP. © 2014 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we present a novel pipeline for building semantic segmentation from oblique UAV images using a fully convolutional neural network (FCN). To cope with the lack of UAV image annotations at facade level, we leverage existing ground-view facades databases to simulate various aerial-view images based on estimated homography, yielding abundant synthetic aerial image annotations as training data.

Although many research studies have been devoted to making predictions on a single entity, it remains an open challenge to forecast future behaviors for multiple interactive agents simultaneously. In this work, we take advantage of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) due to its capability of distribution learning and propose a generic multi-agent probabilistic prediction and tracking framework which takes the interactions among multiple entities into account, in which all the entities are treated as a whole. However, since GAN is very hard to train, we make an empirical research and present the relationship between training performance and hyperparameter values with a numerical case study. The results imply that the proposed model can capture both the mean, variance and multi-modalities of the groundtruth distribution. Moreover, we apply the proposed approach to a real-world task of vehicle behavior prediction to demonstrate its effectiveness and accuracy. The results illustrate that the proposed model trained by adversarial learning can achieve a better prediction performance than other state-of-the-art models trained by traditional supervised learning which maximizes the data likelihood.

The basic idea of PLS is to exploit the characteristics of the wireless channel and its impairments including noise, fading, interference, dispersion, diversity, etc. in order to ensure the ability of the intended user to successfully perform data decoding while preventing eavesdroppers from doing so. Thus, the main design goal of PLS is to increase the performance difference between the link of the legitimate receiver and that of the eavesdropper by using well-designed transmission schemes. In this survey, we propose a conceptual, generic, and expandable framework for classifying the existing PLS techniques against wireless passive eavesdropping. In this flexible framework, the security techniques that we comprehensively review in this treatise are divided into two primary approaches: signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio-based approach and complexity-based approach. The first approach is classified into three major categories: first, secrecy channel codes-based schemes; second, security techniques based on channel adaptation; third, schemes based on injecting interfering artificial (noise/jamming) signals along with the transmitted information signals. The second approach (complexity-based), which is associated with the mechanisms of extracting secret sequences from the shared channel, is classified into two main categories based on which layer the secret sequence obtained by channel quantization is applied on. The techniques belonging to each one of these categories are divided and classified into three main signal domains: time, frequency and space. For each one of these domains, several examples are given and illustrated along with the review of the state-of-the-art security advances in each domain. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of each approach alongside the lessons learned from existing research works are stated and discussed. The recent applications of PLS techniques to different emerging communication systems such as visible light communication, body area network, power line communication, Internet of Things, smart grid, mm-Wave, cognitive radio, vehicular ad-hoc network, unmanned aerial vehicle, ultra-wideband, device-to-device, radio-frequency identification, index modulation, and 5G non-orthogonal multiple access based-systems, are also reviewed and discussed.

The deployment of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by paramilitary organizations during conflicts around the world has become a reality, non-lethal “paparazzi” actions have become a common practice, and it is only a matter of time until the population faces lethal attacks. The basic prerequisite for direct defense against attacking UAVs is their detection. The authors of this paper analysed the possibility of detecting flying aircraft in several different electro-magnetic spectrum bands. Firstly, methods based on calculations and simulations were chosen, and experiments in laboratories and measurements of the exterior were subsequently performed. As a result, values of the radar cross section (RCS), the noise level, the surface temperature, and optical as well as acoustic traces of tested devices were quantified. The outputs obtained from calculated, simulated, and experimentally detected values were found via UAV detection distances using specific sensors working in corresponding parts of the frequency spectrum. © 2019 by the authors.

While this may be practical and sometimes effective, widespread in-water surveys may enhance assessments by including additional demographics, locations, and revealing emerging population trends. Here, we describe sea turtle observations from 13 years of towed-diver surveys across 53 coral islands, atolls, and reefs in the Central, West, and South Pacific. These surveys covered more than 7,300 linear km, and observed more than 3,400 green (Chelonia mydas) and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) sea turtles. From these data, we estimated sea turtle densities, described trends across space and time, and modelled the influence of environmental and anthropogenic drivers. Both species were patchily distributed across spatial scales, and green turtles were 11 times more abundant than hawksbills. The Pacific Remote Island Areas had the highest densities of greens (3.62 turtles km-1, Jarvis Island), while American Samoa had the most hawksbills (0.12 turtles km-1, Ta’u Island). The Hawaiian Islands had the lowest turtle densities (island ave = 0.07 turtles km-1) yet the highest annual population growth (μ = 0.08, σ = 0.22), suggesting extensive management protections can yield positive conservation results. Densities peaked at 27.5C SST, in areas of high productivity and low human impact, and were consistent with patterns of historic overexploitation. Though such intensive surveys have great value, they are logistically demanding and therefore have an uncertain budget and programmatic future.

In parallel, a series of State of the Art cooperative safety and automated solutions do not exploit data directly originating from the infrastructure and the environment, failing, in this way, to have the most reliable possible safety critical information that is vital to the optimum fulfillment of their objectives; that being primarily the increase of traffic safety. SAFE STRIP (SAFE and green Sensor Technologies for self-explaining and forgiving Road Interactive aPplications) EU funded project envisions to simultaneously address those challenges by introducing a revolutionary C-ITS approach through the placement of low-cost innovative sensorial frameworks on the road pavement surface itself in order to acquire reliable and lane specific traffic and environmental information that is directed through I2X (Infrastructure to Everything) communication to all types of vehicles. The current manuscript presents the vision and objectives, the core use cases serving as the proof of concept of the technological solution built, the implementation approach towards delivering the solution and, finally, the multilayered validation approach anticipated by the Consortium towards delivering a prototype of an as much as possible high technological readiness as well as C-ITS functions evidencing its value. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

As a result, producers of edible oils are obliged to closely monitor the GE levels in all their products. Unfortunately, the three available AOCS methods to measure GE are not really suited for application in a quality control (QC) laboratory within a production facility, where short turnaround times are vital. AOCS Cd29c-13 has the highest potential from a turnaround perspective, but remains disputable because it is based on a differential GE measurement. Hence, in 2016 the authors published an automated procedure in which the shortcomings of the AOCS Cd29c-13 are effectively addressed. This article presents the results of an interlaboratory comparison, which is organised across six laboratories in four countries. Methods involved include AOCS Cd29b-13 as well as an optimized version of the 2016 method, which is carried out both automatically and manually. Prior to validation, several optimizations are implemented to further reduce turnaround time and improve robustness of the original method. Based on the results of the interlaboratory comparison, it is concluded that the automated procedure performs slightly better than the manual alternative. Compared to the AOCS Cd29b-13, no significant differences are observed for various types and blends of vegetable oils. Practical Application: Because the EU has recently enforced its legislation for maximum GE levels in edible oils, QC laboratories across the EU are looking for methods which are easily implemented. In practice, this implies high quality, low costs and high sample capacity. Food safety demands fast and reliable analysis in order to verify the quality of refined edible oils and fats. Due to the toxicological relevance of these process contaminants, turnaround time is a crucial performance parameter and any possibility of reducing analysis time has to be fully exploited. The method presented here, provides the short turnaround times required for these purposes and is validated by interlaboratory comparison. This is crucial in the coming years when new EU legislation as well as efforts by food companies will continue to push the continuation of mitigation efforts by edible oil producers.

This paper addresses the problem of vehicle localization in urban environments. Our approach performs a graph-based sliding window optimization over a set of recent landmark and odometry measurements for fast and accurate vehicle localization on third-party maps. Our work incorporates landmark priors from third-party maps into the estimation problem and shows how to exploit the sliding window formulation for revising data associations. We describe how to construct our factor graph and derive its necessary factors to model the information from the map as a prior over the landmark detections. We implemented our approach on an automated car and thoroughly tested it on real-world data. The experiments suggest that the approach provides highly accurate pose estimates, is fast enough for automated driving applications, and outperforms localization using particle filters. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This requires models to be robust to changes to the input. However, recent literature has showed that they are easily fooled when human imperceptible noise, also known as adversarial noise, is added to the input. By exploiting this adversarial nature, various adversarial attacks and defences against these attacks have been introduced so far. In this paper, we propose a new approach which can be used alongside any existing adversarial attack to further reduce the L2 distance between the generated adversarial image and the original image. Our approach can also be thought of as a new adversarial attack built on top of an existing attack. We evaluated our approach on the ImageNet dataset.

It allows bi-directional flow of communication and electricity between electric vehicles (EVs) and the Smart Grid (SG), in order to provide more sophisticated energy trading. However, due to the involvement of a huge amount of trading data and the presence of untrusted entities in the visiting networks, the underlying V2G infrastructure suffers from various security and privacy challenges. Although, several solutions have been proposed in the literature to address these problems, issues like lack of mutual authentication and anonymity, incapability to protect against several attack vectors, generation of huge overhead, and dependency on centralized infrastructures make security and privacy issues even more challenging. To address the above mentioned problems, in this paper, we propose a blockchain oriented hierarchical authentication mechanism for rewarding EVs. The overall process is broadly classified into the following phases: 1) System Initialization, 2) Registration, 3) Hierarchical Mutual Authentication, and 4) Consensus; wherein blockchain's distributed ledger has been employed for transaction execution in distributed V2G environments while Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has been used for hierarchical authentication. The designed hierarchical authentication mechanism has been employed to preserve the anonymity of EVs and support mutual authentication between EVs, charging stations (CSs) and the central aggregator (CAG). Additionally, it also supports minimal communicational and computational overheads on resource constrained EVs. Further, formal security verification of the proposed scheme on widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool validates its safeness against different security attacks. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we study the UAV networks with n UAVs acting as aerial sensors. UAVs generally have short flight duration and need to frequently get energy replenishment from the control station. Hence, the returning UAVs bring the data of the UAVs along the returning paths to the control station with a store-carry-and-forward (SCF) mode. A critical range for the distance between the UAV and the control station is discovered. Within the critical range, the per-node capacity of the SCF mode is Θ (n/log n) times higher than that of the multihop mode. However, the per-node capacity of the SCF mode outside the critical range decreases with the distance between the UAV and the control station. To eliminate the critical range, a mobility control scheme is proposed such that the capacity scaling laws of the SCF mode are the same for all UAVs, which improves the capacity performance of UAV networks. Moreover, the delay of the SCF mode is derived. The impact of the size of the entire region, the velocity of UAVs, the number of UAVs and the flight duration of UAVs on the delay of SCF mode is analyzed. This paper reveals that the mobility and short flight duration of UAVs have beneficial effects on the performance of UAV networks, which may motivate the study of SCF schemes for UAV networks. © 2014 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we propose an anti-intelligent UAV jamming strategy, in which the mobile users can learn the optimal defense strategy to prevent jamming. Specifically, the UAV jammer acts as a leader and the users act as followers. The problem is formulated as a stackelberg dynamic game, which includes the leader sub-game and the followers sub-game. As the UAV jammer is only aware of the incomplete channel state information (CSI) of the users, we model the leader sub-game as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The optimal jamming trajectory is obtained via deep recurrent Q-networks (DRQN) in the three-dimension space. For the followers sub-game, we use the Markov decision process (MDP) to model it. Then the optimal communication trajectory can be learned via deep Q-networks (DQN) in the two-dimension space. We prove the existence of the stackelberg equilibrium. The simulations show that the proposed strategy outperforms the benchmark strategies. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Lack of interpretability and interoperability among security systems are considered the key challenges to fully leverage the potential of the collective capabilities of different security systems. The processes of integrating security systems are repetitive, time-consuming and error-prone; these processes are carried out manually by human experts or using ad-hoc methods. To help automate security systems integration processes, we propose an Ontology-driven approach for Security OrchestrAtion Platform (OnSOAP). The developed solution enables interpretability, and interoperability among security systems, which may exist in operational silos. We demonstrate OnSOAP's support for automated integration of security systems to execute the incident response process with three security systems (Splunk, Limacharlie, and Snort) for a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The evaluation results show that OnSOAP enables SecOrP to interpret the input and output of different security systems, produce error-free integration details, and make security systems interoperable with each other to automate and accelerate an incident response process. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To perform autonomous path tracking and navigation, CAVs can exploit vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications to determine their vehicle dynamics parameters, such as location, heading angle, and curvature, which can be then used as inputs to their control system. However, the interference and uncertainty of the wireless channels can increase the transmission delay on the vehicle dynamics and, thus, impair the CAV's ability to track its target path. In this paper, the problem of joint communication network and control system design is studied to solve the path tracking problem for CAVs. In particular, a novel approach is proposed to maximize the number of reliable V2X transmitter-receiver pairs while jointly considering the stability of the controller and the state of the wireless network. Based on the joint design, the maximum transmission delay which can prevent instability in the controller is determined. Then, the reliable V2X links maximization problem is decomposed into two equivalent sub-problems. The first sub-problem is the control mechanism design in which a dual update method is used to determine the headway distance parameter for the control system. The second sub-problem uses the outcome of the first sub-problem to optimize the power allocation for the communication system. To solve this power allocation problem, a novel risk-based approach that uses the so-called conditional value at risk (CVaR) from financial engineering is proposed. Simulation results validate the theoretical results and show that the proposed joint design can improve the number of reliable V2X pairs by as much as 70% compared to a baseline scheme that optimizes the communication and control systems independently. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we focus on detecting an attack meant to destabilize a platoon, thereby causing collisions, and identifying the source of the attack(i.e., the vehicle under control of the adversary) using Fully Connected Deep Neural Networks (FCDNN) and ConvolutionalNeural Networks (CNN). The vehicles in the platoon are assumedto be equipped with sensors (LIDAR and RADAR) that measure the range and relative speed of their immediate neighbors.

The effectiveness of these networks are tested for different scenarios based on local and global sensor information availability.

Ensuring the basis for the assessment of the situation includes obtaining the information of the warring parties and the state parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV). The enemy was used as the input of the decision tree and four kinds of situation results as the output of the decision tree, which provided a theoretical basis for the rationality of the result of the UAV situation estimation. According to the state parameters that affect the attack area of the air-to-air missile, by comparing the same state parameters, the magnitude of the evaluation index value of the UAV and the enemy aircraft were obtained, and the corresponding indicators of the air combat situation classification were designed to meet the rapid response requirements of the situation assessment. The rules of the air combat situation classification were established to be inference rules of the decision tree. Finally, anti-reasoning rules were proposed for undeveloped branches in the decision tree in order to improve learning under unknown conditions.

In this paper, we address the problem of extrinsic calibration of a radar–LiDAR–camera sensor system. This problem is primarily challenging due to sparse informativeness of radar measurements. Namely, radars cannot extract rich structural information about the environment, while their lack of elevation resolution, that is nevertheless accompanied by substantial elevation field of view, introduces uncertainty in the origin of the measurements. We propose a novel calibration method which involves a special target design and two-step optimization procedure to solve the aforementioned challenges. First step of the optimization is minimization of a reprojection error based on an introduced point–circle geometric constraint. Since the first step is not able to provide reliable estimates of all the six extrinsic parameters, we introduce a second step to refine the subset of parameters with high uncertainty. We exploit a pattern discovered in the radar cross section estimation that is correlated to the missing elevation angle. Additionally, we carry out identifiability analysis based on the Fisher Information Matrix to show minimal requirements on the dataset and to verify the method through simulations. We test the calibration method on a variety of sensor configurations and address the problem of radar vertical misalignment. In the end, we show via extensive experiment analysis that the proposed method is able to reliably estimate all the six parameters of the extrinsic calibration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, GPS may not always be available, even in open outdoor areas, because it is vulnerable to natural interference and malicious jamming attacks. Thus, an alternative navigation system is required when the use of GPS is restricted or prohibited. In such circumstances, a marine radar, which is a standard sensor in a marine vehicle including USV, can be used for localization in coastal areas. The marine radar can extract landmark features of the surrounding coastlines. These features can be utilized for relative navigation with respect to the detected coastlines. However, coastline maps based on radar signatures may be unavailable in unexplored areas, and they may be unreliable in coastal areas with high tidal elevations. In this study, the relative navigation with respect to the surrounding coastlines is performed in the framework of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for a USV operation in coastal waters. In particular, coastline features are parameterized by using B-splines for efficient map management, instead of the conventional point cloud representation. To verify and demonstrate the performance of the proposed coastal SLAM algorithm, field experiments were conducted in actual coastal environments. The results are presented and discussed in this paper. © 1976-2012 IEEE.","Review","Final","Scopus"

While numerous studies have examined predation risk and risk effects in recent decades, a lack of standardization in approaches has impeded progress in the field. We provide an overview of five major study design considerations involved in assessing predation risk and responses of prey in carnivore-ungulate systems, highlighting how different design choices can impact the strength and scope of inference. First, we stress the importance of distinguishing measures of predation risk (probability of being killed) from measures of risk effects (costs of antipredator behaviors in response to risk). Second, we recommend explicit consideration of spatial and temporal scales using a standardized framework to facilitate cross-study comparisons. Third, ungulates use visual, auditory, and olfactory sensory pathways to evaluate predation risk. Experiments that manipulate signals of risk (e.g., auditory playbacks or application of predator scent) can be powerful approaches, but the dosages and types of cues need to be carefully considered. Fourth, ungulates usually face threats from multiple predators simultaneously, and we highlight the potential for remote cameras and structural equation modeling to help address this challenge. Fifth, emerging technologies may substantially improve our ability to assess risk. We discuss several promising technologies, such as animal-borne video, unmanned aerial vehicles, and physiological sensors. We conclude with general recommendations for study design, which may improve the utility of predation risk research for the conservation and management of carnivore-ungulate systems. © 2019 The Authors","Review","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we present an approach that uses metamorphic testing principles to automatically detect such adversarial attacks. The approach can detect image manipulations that are so small, that they are impossible to detect by a human through visual inspection.

Despite the inherent potential, nevertheless, it still remains to explore whether the gain of UAV access points (UAPs) could be fully harvested, which is critically dependent on the factors including the flight altitude and deployment density of UAPs. In this light, we investigate the performance of a downlink UAV integrated terrestrial cellular network (UTCN) and analytically study the influence of varying UAP altitude and density on the spatial throughput (ST) of UTCN. In particular, we obtain the UAP altitude upper bound, below which more line-of-sight (LOS) connections could be provided to improve network ST. Otherwise, cross-layer interference over the LOS paths becomes dominant, which results in significant degradation of network ST. More importantly, we reveal the limitation of the application of UAPs by showing that there exists a critical UAP density, beyond which network ST would encounter a rapid decrease. To fully exploit the potential of UAPs, we further tailor a probabilistic interference avoidance scheme and study the optimization of the UAP activated probability. Remarkably, network ST could be substantially improved using the optimized activated probability, i.e., network ST could increase with the growing UAP density and converge to a positive constant instead of zero in the dense UAP regime. Therefore, the results of this paper could provide insight on the deployment and optimization of UTCN. © 2014 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Furthermore, the motion planner exploits an improved trajectory generation method. The kinematically feasible trajectories are generated, which prevents a long-term collision using the predicted results in a probabilistic manner.

Such a capacity can prove critical in inspection through contact missions, as well as when a flying robot is tasked to operate in very narrow environments rendering safe free-flight impossible. To achieve this objective, beyond sliding in contact, a new locomotion primitive is introduced, namely that of azimuth rotations perpendicular to the surface under consideration. This new navigation mode, called flying cartwheel mode, offers navigation resourcefulness and resilience when the system is tasked to move in contact with surfaces that are otherwise non-traversable. The designed path planning method exploits both navigation modalities and a traversability metric to decide when to switch from sliding to flying cartwheel mode, and overall provides cost-optimal trajectories for in-contact navigation. The proposed approach is verified both in simulation, as well as experimentally using a surface presenting complex anomalies. It is highlighted that the proposed method does not assume any specialized contact mechanism or a control law tailored to physical interaction tasks, and hence is applicable to almost any micro aerial vehicle integrating protective shrouds around its propellers. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Large investments, particularly in robotics, electronic miniaturization, sensors, network communication, information technology and artificial intelligence are likely to further accelerate this trend. The operation of unmanned systems, and of applications that use these systems, are heavily dependent on cyber systems that are used to collect, store, process and communicate data, making data a critical resource. At the same time, undesirable elements of our society and adversarial states have also realized the high value of this resource. While enormous efforts have been made to secure data and cyber systems, lack of rigorous threat modeling and risk analysis can lead to more specific, rather than generic, security solutions relevant to the cyber system to be protected. This scenario has created an urgent need to develop a holistic process for protecting data and cyber systems. This paper deals with the development of different pieces of this process. We first identify the security requirements of unmanned autonomous systems, and follow this up with modeling how attacks achieve their objectives. We argue that a large number of threats that can materialize as attacks and the costs of managing these attacks in cost effective ways require ranking threats using cyber threat modeling and cyber risk analysis techniques.

In this paper, we propose multiantenna transceiver design and multihop device-to-device (D2D) communication to guarantee the reliable transmission and extend the UAV coverage for IoT in disasters. First, multihop D2D links are established to extend the coverage of UAV emergency networks due to the constrained transmit power of the UAV. In particular, a shortest-path-routing algorithm is proposed to establish the D2D links rapidly with minimum nodes. The closed-form solutions for the number of hops and the outage probability are derived for the uplink and downlink. Second, the transceiver designs for the UAV uplink and downlink are studied to optimize the performance of UAV transmission. Due to the nonconvexity of the problem, they are first transformed into convex ones and then, low-complexity algorithms are proposed to solve them efficiently.

Locating features within these fields and reconstruction (mapping) of the dense fields can be challenging in resource-constrained situations, such as when trying to locate the source of a gas leak from a small number of measurements. In such cases, a model of the underlying complex dynamics can be exploited to discover informative paths within the field. We use a fluid simulator as a model to guide inference for the location of a gas leak. We perform localization via minimization of the discrepancy between observed measurements and gas concentrations predicted by the simulator. Our method is able to account for dynamically varying parameters of wind flow (e.g., direction and strength) and its effects on the observed distribution of gas.

Its performance may be seriously affected by disturbance resulting from unpredictable environment like changes in road friction coefficient and parameter uncertainty such as cornering stiffness and mass caused by errors of measurement. Besides, since the vehicle system consisting of many systems is an extremely complex nonlinear system, it is almost impossible for us to establish a precise model of a vehicle especially when it is moving. These inevitable factors influence the control accuracy and even threaten the stability and safety of the vehicle system. This paper proposed a promising solution to this problem, robust MPC (Model Predictive Control) combined with the optimal preview controller for path tracking problems of an autonomous vehicle. The state space model in tracking error variables of a passenger vehicle used for path tracking application is established. In order not to regard road curvature as additive disturbance, the error dynamics of the vehicle for a given road curvature is transformed to the error model deviating from the steady state trajectory. A reachable set of the error state is computed on-line based on bounded disturbance. The constraints of nominal state and input are obtained, which ensure state and input constraints are satisfied in presence of disturbances and uncertainties. Then the preview controller is proposed to improve the tracking performance. Simulation using a passenger vehicle is conducted on different road friction coefficient, mass uncertainty and road bank angles, respectively, which are all treated as additive disturbance.

"Guiding Deep Learning System Testing Using Surprise Adequacy","2019","Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering","10.1109/ICSE.2019.00108","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071954052&doi=10.1109%2fICSE.2019.00108&partnerID=40&md5=38b2e4ecbc09dea6cc7a10090bc82f2b","Deep Learning (DL) systems are rapidly being adopted in safety and security critical domains, urgently calling for ways to test their correctness and robustness. Testing of DL systems has traditionally relied on manual collection and labelling of data. Recently, a number of coverage criteria based on neuron activation values have been proposed. These criteria essentially count the number of neurons whose activation during the execution of a DL system satisfied certain properties, such as being above predefined thresholds. However, existing coverage criteria are not sufficiently fine grained to capture subtle behaviours exhibited by DL systems. Moreover, evaluations have focused on showing correlation between adversarial examples and proposed criteria rather than evaluating and guiding their use for actual testing of DL systems. We propose a novel test adequacy criterion for testing of DL systems, called Surprise Adequacy for Deep Learning Systems (SADL), which is based on the behaviour of DL systems with respect to their training data. We measure the surprise of an input as the difference in DL system's behaviour between the input and the training data (i.e., what was learnt during training), and subsequently develop this as an adequacy criterion: a good test input should be sufficiently but not overtly surprising compared to training data. Empirical evaluation using a range of DL systems from simple image classifiers to autonomous driving car platforms shows that systematic sampling of inputs based on their surprise can improve classification accuracy of DL systems against adversarial examples by up to 77.5% via retraining. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This paper presents an overview of how these systems generally work and why securing them at three different layers that are more important compared to traditional software. Since human beings directly interact with the physical devices, therefore it is important to guarantee that they are secure at any point in time. If an intruder gains control over an autonomous car driving system, the consequences could be life-threatening to many people. Cyber-security is trying to prevent this worst-case scenario but struggles with two major problems: First, CPS/IoT are typically a combination of many separate systems. These systems are often legacy software, which sometimes is no longer up-to-date and could provide many security issues, which are hard to patch since the original developers are not part of the new project. Second, classic security measures aimed at the application and the network layer but CPS/IoT provides a third, physical layer, which needs to be protected. Sensors and actuators are physical parts of the real environment and can be damaged or destroyed by any human intruder or natural disaster if not secured properly. Since security in CPS and IoT have been dramatically neglected in the past years, this paper aims at understanding the security of CPS and IoT. Therefore, in this paper we propose an architecture, where we analyzed the security threats for CPS/IoT. Hence, can easily determine the security requirements for CPS/IoT. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this context, building and updating a common map of the field is an essential but challenging task. The maps built using robots of different types show differences in size, resolution, and scale, the associated geolocation data may be inaccurate and biased while the repetitiveness of both visual appearance and geometric structures found within agricultural contexts render classical map merging techniques ineffective. In this letter, we propose AgriColMap, a novel map registration pipeline that leverages a grid-based multimodal environment representation, which includes a vegetation index map and a digital surface model. We cast the data association problem between maps built from UAVs and UGVs as a multimodal, large displacement dense optical flow estimation. The dominant, coherent flows, selected using a voting scheme, are used as point-to-point correspondences to infer a preliminary nonrigid alignment between the maps. A final refinement is then performed, by exploiting only meaningful parts of the registered maps. We evaluate our system using real-world data for three fields with different crop species. The results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art map registration and matching techniques by a large margin, and has a higher tolerance to large initial misalignments.

Because of high mobility and attitude variations, it is challenging to maintain the communication link among the navigating UAVs with narrow beam in the mmWave band. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to establish a transmission-oriented UAV attitude prediction model for the UAV-to-UAV mmWave communication link. In particular, a position-attitude prediction based beam tracking algorithm is proposed. First, a Guassian Process (GP) based learning algorithm is presented for the transmitting UAV to predict the position and attitude of the receiving UAV by using the previous position-attitude data and exploiting the relationship between the position and attitude. Then, the analog beamforming vectors are derived by using the predicted spatial angles. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed learning algorithm can achieve high accurate position-attitude prediction, and the beam tracking algorithm considering UAV attitude variations significantly outperforms the existing algorithms with only position information. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The impact on safety engineering of automotive functions is arguably one of the most important changes. There has been a need to re-think the impact of the partial or complete absence of the human driver (in terms of a supervisory entity) in not only newly developed functions but also in the qualification of the use of legacy functions in new contexts. The scope of the variety of scenarios that a vehicle may encounter even within a constrained Operational Design Domain, and the highly dynamic nature of Automated Driving, mean that new methods such as simulation can greatly aid the process of safety engineering. This paper discusses the need for early verification of the Functional Safety Concepts (FSCs), details the information typically available at this stage in the product lifecycle, and proposes a co-simulation platform named AD-EYE designed for exploiting the possibilities in an industrial context by evaluating design decisions and refining Functional Safety Requirements based on a reusable scenario database.

Rapid and precise extraction of the flooded areas is key to supporting emergency-response planning and providing damage assessment in both spatial and temporal measurements. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology has recently been recognized as an efficient photogrammetry data acquisition platform to quickly deliver high-resolution imagery because of its cost-effectiveness, ability to fly at lower altitudes, and ability to enter a hazardous area. Different image classification methods including SVM (Support Vector Machine) have been used for flood extent mapping. In recent years, there has been a significant improvement in remote sensing image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs have demonstrated excellent performance on various tasks including image classification, feature extraction, and segmentation. CNNs can learn features automatically from large datasets through the organization of multi-layers of neurons and have the ability to implement nonlinear decision functions. This study investigates the potential of CNN approaches to extract flooded areas from UAV imagery. A VGG-based fully convolutional network (FCN-16s) was used in this research. The model was fine-tuned and a k-fold cross-validation was applied to estimate the performance of the model on the new UAV imagery dataset. This approach allowed FCN-16s to be trained on the datasets that contained only one hundred training samples, and resulted in a highly accurate classification. Confusion matrix was calculated to estimate the accuracy of the proposed method. The image segmentation results obtained from FCN-16s were compared from the results obtained from FCN-8s, FCN-32s and SVMs. Experimental results showed that the FCNs could extract flooded areas precisely from UAV images compared to the traditional classifiers such as SVMs. The classification accuracy achieved by FCN-16s, FCN-8s, FCN-32s, and SVM for the water class was 97.52%, 97.8%, 94.20% and 89%, respectively. © 2019 by the authors.

The goal is that a quadrotor helicopter autonomously approaches a selected target. Therefore, it is necessary to locate the target in live images. In this paper, the target is a point in a window which is selected by an operator in a reference image. This reference point is projected into the live image and tracked over consecutive images. In order to reliably project the reference point into the live image, a robust matching algorithm is proposed. Projective transformations are applied to the reference image to extract additional keypoints and to gain invariance to out-of-plane perspective transformations. A rating based on a color descriptor and on the cross correlation values of regions around inlier keypoints is used to evaluate the quality of the estimated homography matrix. Since the matching algorithm does not exploit the beneficial characteristics of image sequences and because its processing time is not short enough for high frame rates, a tracking algorithm is presented. In order to avoid divergence, tracking is re-initialized based on the rating of the matching result. High detection rates even in image sequences with large viewpoint changes are achieved. Moreover, through parallelization the algorithm offers very low processing times. It is shown that images can be processed at high frame rates in real-time. © 2019 Concern CSRI Elektropribor, JSC.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, human experience and onboard intelligence can may help mitigate such cases. Unfortunately, human operators have cognition limits when directly supervising multiple UGVs. Ideally, an automated decision aid can be designed that empowers the human operator to supervise the UGVs. In this paper, we consider a connected UGV platoon under cyber attacks that may disrupt safety and degrade performance. An observer-based resilient control strategy is designed to mitigate the effects of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cyber attacks. In addition, each UGV generates both internal and external evaluations based on the platoons performance metrics. A cloud-based trust-based information management system collects these evaluations to detect abnormal UGV platoon behaviors. To deal with inaccurate information due to a V2C cyber attack, a RoboTrust algorithm is designed to analyze vehicle trustworthiness and eliminate information with low credit. Finally, a human operator scheduling algorithm is proposed when the number of abnormal UGVs exceeds the limit of what human operators can handle concurrently. Representative simulation results demonstrate that the proposed automated decision aid can effectively guide human operators when working with platoons under cyber attacks. The platoon survivability has been improved by the proposed algorithm when compared to those that operate without this system. © 2019 SAE International.

Rapid detection of these bacteria from patient samples at the point of care could contribute to improved clinical outcomes in the event of a bioterrorism attack. A multiplex nested PCR assay for detection of F. tularensis, B. anthracis, and Y. pestis directly from patient blood samples was developed using the GeneXpert system. The multiplex Gene- Xpert cartridge-based assay includes all necessary sample processing and amplification reagents. Blood samples spiked with different numbers of CFU were used to measure the analytical limit of detection (LOD) and dynamic range. Sensitivity was determined by testing spiked blood samples and negative-control blood in a blind manner. Specificity was determined by testing against nontarget pathogens and blood samples from clinical patients. The assay LOD was 8.5 CFU/ml for F. tularensis, 10 CFU/ml for B. anthracis, and 4.5 CFU/ml for Y. pestis. The sensitivity was 100% at the LOD for all three select agent bacteria in spiked patient blood samples. The assay specificity was 100% when it was tested against both nontarget pathogens and clinical patient blood samples. The total assay time was approximately 100 min. This automated assay, which is suitable for use at the point of care, identifies three select agents directly in blood without the need for enrichment with a high sensitivity within 100 min.

Accelerating landslides may end up in a catastrophic slope failure in terms of rapid rock avalanches. Continuous landslide monitoring enables the identification of critical acceleration thresholds, which are required in natural hazard management. Among many existing monitoring methods, laser scanning is a cost effective method providing 3D data for deriving three dimensional and areawide displacement vectors at certain morphological structures travelling on top of the landslide. Comparing displacements between selected observation periods allows the spatial interpretation of landslide acceleration or deceleration. This contribution presents five laser scanning datasets of the active Reissenschuh landslide (Tyrol, Austria) acquired by airborne laser scanning (ALS), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and Unmanned aerial vehicle Laser Scanning (ULS) sensors. Three observation periods with acquisition dates between 2008 and 2018 are used to derive area-wide displacement vectors. To ensure a most suitable displacement derivation between ALS, TLS and ULS platforms, an analysis investigating point cloud features within varying search radii is carried out, in order to identify a neighbourhood where common surfaces are represented platform independent or differences between the platforms are minimized. Consequent displacement vector estimation is done by ICP-Matching using morphological structures within the high resolution TLS and ULS point cloud. Displacements from the lower resolution ALS point cloud and TLS point cloud were determined using a modified version of the well-known image correlation (IMCORR) method working with point cloud derived shaded relief images combined with digital terrain models (DTM). The interplatform compatible analyses of the multi-temporal laser scanning data allows to quantify the area-wide displacement patterns of the landslide. Furthermore, changes of these displacement patterns over time are assessed area-wide.

Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), acting as flying base stations (BSs) or relays with caching capability, have been widely investigated as an effective and enhanced communication support from the sky to provide the ground users improved quality of services (QoS) in a variety of circumstances. In this paper, by fully exploiting the advantages of UAVs introduced in VANETs, we design an advanced UAV-aided cooperative data dissemination scheduling strategy to improve the data dissemination performance in VANETs. Considering the mobility of the involved UAVs, we further propose a three-dimensional (3D) spatial dynamic programming (SDP) algorithm for the trajectory scheduling of UAVs to optimize the network transmission utility. Simulations results verify that, compared with other data dissemination strategies, our proposed UAV-aided cooperative data dissemination strategy can efficiently achieve a better system performance in terms of downloading progress and transmission delay. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The PNC system exploits the information provided by geomagnetic features observed on the sea-floor to correct the inevitable drift in the vehicle position estimates using dead-reckoning (DR). The three components of the PNC system are: a path planner that enhances the exploratory strength of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm with transition tests to choose new potential states, a sequential estimation algorithm, and a path following controller. The performance of the system is assessed via hardware in the loop (HIL) simulations to illustrate the significance of using magnetic data for navigation of AUVs.

A cooperative control is presented, which can guarantee safety driving of a platoon with the lowest fuel consumption. First, we develop a nonlinear platoon vehicle dynamic model considering road topography and platoon heterogeneity. The optimization problem is formulated by using the optimization index, which is a function of fuel consumption. A receding horizon dynamic programming (RHDP) methodology is proposed to obtain the reference velocity. Then, based on the nonlinear vehicle model and exploiting backstepping methodology, the tracking controller is designed, and further the string stability of the platoon is analyzed.

"How do doctors experience the interactions among professional fulfilment, organisational factors and quality of patient care? A qualitative study in a Norwegian hospital","2019","BMJ Open","10.1136/bmjopen-2018-026971","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066834747&doi=10.1136%2fbmjopen-2018-026971&partnerID=40&md5=b054a78ea4f8d02595e55d9fd3075c54","Objectives Doctors increasingly experience high levels of burnout and loss of engagement. To address this, there is a need to better understand doctors' work situation. This study explores how doctors experience the interactions among professional fulfilment, organisational factors and quality of patient care. Design An exploratory qualitative study design with semistructured individual interviews was chosen. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed by a transdisciplinary research group. Setting The study focused on a surgical department of a mid-sized hospital in Norway. Participants Seven doctors were interviewed. A purposeful sampling was used with gender and seniority as selection criteria. Three senior doctors (two female, one male) and four in training (three male, one female) were interviewed. Results We found that in order to provide quality care to the patients, individual doctors described a € stretching themselves', that is, handling the tensions between quantity and quality, to overcome organisational shortcomings. Experiencing a workplace emphasis on production numbers and budget concerns led to feelings of estrangement among the doctors. Participants reported a shift from serving as trustworthy, autonomous professionals to becoming production workers, where professional identity was threatened. They felt less aligned with workplace values, in addition to experiencing limited management recognition for quality of patient care. Management initiatives to include doctors in development of organisational policies, processes and systems were sparse. Conclusion The interviewed doctors described their struggle to balance the inherent tension among professional fulfilment, organisational factors and quality of patient care in their everyday work. They communicated how a € stretching themselves', to overcome organisational shortcomings, is no longer a feasible strategy without compromising both professional fulfilment and quality of patient care. Managers need to ensure that doctors are involved when developing organisational policies, processes and systems. This is likely to be beneficial for both professional fulfilment and quality of patient care. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

This article reviews the authors’ simulation studies of how fatigue, automation, and distraction may intersect as threats to safety. Distinguishing between states of active and passive fatigue supports understanding of fatigue and the development of countermeasures. Active fatigue is a stress-like state driven by overload of cognitive capabilities. Passive fatigue is produced by underload and monotony, and is associated with loss of task engagement and alertness. Our studies show that automated driving reliably elicits subjective symptoms of passive fatigue and also loss of alertness that persists following manual takeover. Passive fatigue also impairs attention and automation use in operators of Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPVs). Use of in-vehicle media has been proposed as a countermeasure to fatigue, but such media may also be distracting. Studies tested whether various forms of phone-based media interacted with automation-induced fatigue, but effects were complex and dependent on task configuration. Selection of fatigue countermeasures should be guided by an understanding of the form of fatigue confronting the operator. System design, regulation of level of automation, managing distraction, and selection of fatigue-resilient personnel are all possible interventions for passive fatigue, but careful evaluation of interventions is necessary prior to deployment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

By making only subtle changes to the input of a convolutional neural network, the output of the network can be swayed to output a completely different result. The first attacks did this by changing pixel values of an input image slightly to fool a classifier to output the wrong class. Other approaches have tried to learn 'patches' that can be applied to an object to fool detectors and classifiers. Some of these approaches have also shown that these attacks are feasible in the real-world, i.e. by modifying an object and filming it with a video camera. However, all of these approaches target classes that contain almost no intra-class variety (e.g. stop signs). The known structure of the object is then used to generate an adversarial patch on top of it. In this paper, we present an approach to generate adversarial patches to targets with lots of intra-class variety, namely persons. The goal is to generate a patch that is able successfully hide a person from a person detector. An attack that could for instance be used maliciously to circumvent surveillance systems, intruders can sneak around undetected by holding a small cardboard plate in front of their body aimed towards the surveilance camera. From our results we can see that our system is able significantly lower the accuracy of a person detector. Our approach also functions well in real-life scenarios where the patch is filmed by a camera. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to attempt this kind of attack on targets with a high level of intra-class variety like persons. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

For dynamic testing in LTE networks, we implemented a semi-automated testing tool, named LTEFuzz, by using open-source LTE software over which the user has full control. We systematically generated test cases by defining three basic security properties by closely analyzing the standards. Based on the security property, LTEFuzz generates and sends the test cases to a target network, and classifies the problematic behavior by only monitoring the device-side logs. Accordingly, we uncovered 36 vulnerabilities, which have not been disclosed previously. These findings are categorized into five types: Improper handling of (1) unprotected initial procedure, (2) crafted plain requests, (3) messages with invalid integrity protection, (4) replayed messages, and (5) security procedure bypass. We confirmed those vulnerabilities by demonstrating proof-of-concept attacks against operational LTE networks. The impact of the attacks is to either deny LTE services to legitimate users, spoof SMS messages, or eavesdrop/manipulate user data traffic. Precise root cause analysis and potential countermeasures to address these problems are presented as well. Cellular carriers were partially involved to maintain ethical standards as well as verify our findings in commercial LTE networks. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

They are particularly useful for tasks that are dull, hazardous, or dirty. Whether the use of drone delivery is beneficial to the environment and cost saving is still a topic under debate. Ideally, drones yield lower energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus reducing the carbon footprint and enhancing environmental sustainability. In this research, we analytically study the impact of UAVs on CO2 emission and cost. We propose a mixed-integer (0–1 linear) green routing model for UAV to exploit the sustainability aspects of the use of UAVs for last-mile parcel deliveries. A genetic algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the complex model, and an extensive experiment is conducted to illustrate and validate the analytical model and the solution algorithm. We find that optimally routing and delivering packages with UAVs would save energy and reduce carbon emissions.

Vehicular fog networks (VeFNs) have thus emerged to enable computing resource sharing via computation task offloading, providing a wide range of fog applications. However, the high mobility of vehicles makes it hard to guarantee the delay that accounts for both communication and computation throughout the whole task offloading procedure. In this article, we first review the state of the art of task offloading in VeFNs, and argue that mobility is not only an obstacle for timely computing in VeFNs, but can also benefit the delay performance. We then identify machine learning and coded computing as key enabling technologies to address and exploit mobility in VeFNs. Case studies are provided to illustrate how to adapt learning algorithms to suit the dynamic environment in VeFNs, and how to exploit the mobility with opportunistic computation offloading and task replication. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The motility of these motors is generally controlled by the concentration of accessible fuel, and therefore, engineering speed-regulation mechanisms, particularly using biological triggers, remains a continuing challenge. Here, control over the movement of superassembled porous framework micromotors via a reversible, biological-relevant pH-responsive regulatory mechanism is demonstrated. Succinylated β-lactoglobulin and catalase are superassembled in porous framework particles, where the β-lactoglobulin is permeable at neutral pH. This permeability allows the fuel (H                             2                             O                             2                             ) to access catalase, leading to autonomous movement of the micromotors. However, at mild acidic pH, succinylated β-lactoglobulin undergoes a reversible gelation process, preventing the access of fuel into the micromotors where the catalase resides. To one's knowledge, this study represents the first example of chemically driven motors with rapid, reversible pH-responsive motility. Furthermore, the porous framework significantly enhances the biocatalytic activity of catalase, allowing ultralow H                             2                             O                             2                              concentrations to be exploited at physiological conditions.

Theory and Methods: A segmentation pipeline was built using joint adversarial and segmentation network. A convolutional neural network technique called cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) was applied as the core of the method to perform unpaired image-to-image translation between different MR image datasets. A joint segmentation network was incorporated into the adversarial network to obtain additional functionality for semantic segmentation. The fully automated segmentation method termed as SUSAN was tested for segmenting bone and cartilage on 2 clinical knee MR image datasets using images and annotated segmentation masks from an online publicly available knee MR image dataset. The segmentation results were compared using quantitative segmentation metrics with the results from a supervised U-Net segmentation method and 2 registration methods. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to evaluate the value difference of quantitative metrics between different methods. Results: The proposed method SUSAN provided high segmentation accuracy with results comparable to the supervised U-Net segmentation method (most quantitative metrics having P > 0.05) and significantly better than a multiatlas registration method (all quantitative metrics having P < 0.001) and a direct registration method (all quantitative metrics having P< 0.0001) for the clinical knee image datasets.

Although most messages of AFC systems are insecurely transferred in plaintext, system operators did not pay much attention to this vulnerability, since the AFC network is basically isolated from the public network (e.g., the Internet) - there is no way of exploiting such a vulnerability from the outside of the AFC network. Nevertheless, in recent years, the advent of Near Field Communication (NFC)-equipped smartphones has opened up a channel to invade into the AFC network from the mobile Internet, i.e., by Host-based Card Emulation (HCE) over NFC-equipped smartphones. In this paper, we identify a novel paradigm of attacks, called LessPay, against modern distance-based pricing AFC systems, enabling users to pay much less than what they are supposed to be charged. The identified attack has two important properties: 1) it is invisible to AFC system operators because the attack never causes any inconsistency in the back-end database of the operators; and 2) it can be scalable to affect a large number of users (e.g., 10,000) by only requiring a moderate-sized AFC card pool (e.g., containing 150 cards). To evaluate the efficacy of the attack, we developed an HCE app to launch the LessPay attack; and the real-world experiments demonstrate not only the feasibility of the LessPay attack (with 97.6 percent success rate) but also its low cost in terms of bandwidth and computation. Finally, we propose, implement and evaluate four types of countermeasures, and present security analysis and comparison of these countermeasures on defending against the LessPay attack. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Threats arise from interactions among pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles, more complicated vehicle trajectories in the absence of lane markings, phases that prevent determining who has the right of way, invisible vehicle approaches, vehicle obstructions, and illegal movements. These challenges are not fully addressed by the “road diet” and road redesign prescribed in Vision Zero plans, nor will they be completely overcome by autonomous vehicles with their many sensors and tireless attention to surroundings. Accidents can also occur because drivers, cyclists and pedestrians do not have the information they need to avoid wrong decisions. In these cases, the missing information can be computed and broadcast by an intelligent intersection. The information gives the current full signal phase, an estimate of the time when the phase will change, and the occupancy of the blind spots of the driver or autonomous vehicle. The paper develops a design of the intelligent intersection, motivated by the analysis of an accident at an intersection in Tempe, AZ, between an automated Uber Volvo and a manual Honda CRV and culminates in a proposal for an intelligent intersection infrastructure. The intelligent intersection also serves as a software-enabled version of the ‘protected intersection’ design to improve the passage of cyclists and pedestrians through an intersection. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

To improve the investigation efficiency of red-attack damage and provide basic data for sanitation logging. 【 Method】 The extraction rules of the HSV threshold method were built according to the difference between red attack pine trees and other elements in the “H-V space”. The recognition results of red attack pine trees between the RGB threshold method and HSV threshold method were compared under different scenarios. Next, the evaluation accuracy of both methods was calculated. 【Result】① Samples of red attack pine trees plotted in the “H-V space” point cloud showed significant clustering and a banding distribution in the “G-R space” point cloud. ② A strong correlation among the components in the RGB color space was a main factor for the large omission errors of red attack pine tree extraction using the RGB threshold method. The overall accuracy of the HSV threshold method, based on decoupling of the hue and value from the HSV color space and its convenient threshold segmentation, outperformed that of the RGB threshold method for red attack pine tree recognition based on UAV imagery. ③ The HSV threshold method performed well for monitoring pines affected by pine wilt disease in a late stage, which achieved 60%-65% overall accuracy when the distribution of pine trees before infection from high-resolution imagery was used as a mask. 【Conclusion】 The HSV threshold method shows some advantages for monitoring red attack pine trees based on UAV imagery compared to manual interpretation.

For both the level flight regimes, the elevator deflection and propeller rotations per minute (RPM) are computed using a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control designed about the respective trim states. For cruise to harrier and harrier to cruise transitions, a minimum time optimal trajectory is generated off-line and the same is tracked using a linear state feedback control. Simulations of the control implemented on a longitudinal model of an agile fixed-wing UAV which includes propwash, wing downwash, flat plate post-stall aerodynamics and actuator constraints (first order dynamics, saturation and rate limit) are carried out. The results show that the control scheme is successful in achieving transition between cruise and harrier level flights. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

But, the fact that we do not know when a specific DNN will work and when it will fail has resulted in a lack of trust. A clear example is self-driving cars; people are uncomfortable sitting in a car driven by algorithms that may fail under some unknown, unpredictable conditions. Interpretability and explainability approaches attempt to address this by uncovering what a DNN models, ie, what each node (cell) in the network represents and what images are most likely to activate it. This can be used to generate, for example, adversarial attacks. But these approaches do not generally allow us to determine where a DNN will succeed or fail and {em why. ie, does this learned representation {em generalize} to unseen samples? Here, we derive a novel approach to define what it means to learn in deep networks, and how to use this knowledge to detect adversarial attacks. We show how this defines the ability of a network to generalize to unseen testing samples and, most importantly, {em why} this is the case. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The oscillator architecture is simplified to eliminate the Sin function and is described in details in VHDL. Then, we propose chaotic oscillator attacking system including clock glitch generator to compromise the oscillator by injecting glitches on function clock.

As a consequence, adversarial robustness poses a significant challenge for the deployment of ML-based systems in safety-and security-critical environments like autonomous driving, disease detection or unmanned aerial vehicles. In the past years we have seen an impressive amount of publications presenting more and more new adversarial attacks. However, the attack research seems to be rather unstructured and new attacks often appear to be random selections from the unlimited set of possible adversarial attacks. With this publication, we present a structured analysis of the adversarial attack creation process. By detecting different building blocks of adversarial attacks, we outline the road to new sets of adversarial attacks. We call this the 'attack generator'. In the pursuit of this objective, we summarize and extend existing adversarial perturbation taxonomies. The resulting taxonomy is then linked to the application context of computer vision systems for autonomous vehicles, i.e. semantic segmentation and object detection. Finally, in order to prove the usefulness of the attack generator, we investigate existing semantic segmentation attacks with respect to the detected defining components of adversarial attacks. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Attacks on data or algorithms in AI applications can lead to misclassification or misprediction, which can fail the applications. For each dataset separately, the parameters of ML algorithms should be tuned to reach a desirable classification or prediction accuracy. Typically, ML experts tune the parameters empirically, which can be time consuming and does not guarantee the optimal result. To this end, some research suggests an analytical approach to tune the ML parameters for maximum accuracy. However, none of the works consider the ML performance under attack in their tuning process. This paper proposes an analytical framework for tuning the ML parameters to be secure against attacks, while keeping its accuracy high. The framework finds the optimal set of parameters by defining a novel objective function, which takes into account the test results of both ML accuracy and its security against attacks. For validating the framework, an AI application is implemented to recognize whether a subject's eyes are open or closed, by applying k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on her Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this application, the number of neighbors (k) and the distance metric type, as the two main parameters of kNN, are chosen for tuning. The input data perturbation attack, as one of the most common attacks on ML algorithms, is used for testing the security of the application. Exhaustive search approach is used to solve the optimization problem. The experiment results show k = 43 and cosine distance metric is the optimal configuration of kNN for the EEG dataset, which leads to 83.75% classification accuracy and reduces the attack success rate to 5.21%. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Two UAV network topologies are considered for data propagation and information fusion. In the former, we form a sequential UAV node chain, whereas in the latter, the UAV nodes are grouped into clusters and the information among different clusters is propagated through the cluster master nodes. Sparse reconstruction methods are used to fuse the target state information from previous nodes or clusters with the data measured in the underlying nodes or clusters, depending on the adopted topology, to achieve improved target state estimates. In order to minimize the communication traffic in the UAV network, each node transmits the estimated Doppler signatures or sparse target state estimates to the next UAV node in the network or the cluster master node, in lieu of the large volume of raw sampled data. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and compare the performance between the two UAV network topologies. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The existing self-positioning capability of individual vehicles remains insufficient. Also, bottlenecks in developing on-board perception systems stymie further improvements in the precision and integrity of positioning targets. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, which is fast becoming a standard component of intelligent and connected vehicles, renders new sources of information such as dynamically updated high-definition (HD) maps accessible. In this paper, we propose a unified theoretical framework for multiple-target positioning by fusing multi-source heterogeneous information from the on-board sensors and V2X technology of vehicles. Numerical and theoretical studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the framework proposed. With a low-cost global navigation satellite system (GNSS) coupled with an initial navigation system (INS), on-board sensors, and a normally equipped HD map, the precision of multiple-target positioning attained can meet the requirements of high-level automated vehicles. Meanwhile, the integrity of target sensing is significantly improved by the sharing of sensor information and exploitation of map data. Furthermore, our framework is more adaptable to traffic scenarios when compared with state-of-the-art techniques. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The main parameters of the tai-sitter, wingspan, sweep angle, winglet height and winglet thickness were investigated to optimize the structure design. Central composite design (CCD) was employed to construct 25 sample points. Numerical simulation of lift drag ratio and drag were carried out with ANSYS CFX. The response surface models (RSM) of UAV structure parameters with lift drag ratio and drag were established by Design-Expert software. The lift drag ratio was increased with the increase of wing length and height of winglet. The lift drag ratio was decreased with the increase of wing thickness at attack angle of 4°~8°, and with the decrease of wing thickness at attack angle of 10°~12°. The impact of sweep angle and wing height on the lift drag ratio was small. The drag was increased with the increase of wing length and thickness of wing, and decreased with the increase of winglet height. The drag was increased firstly with the increase of sweep angle and then decreased. The multi-objective genetic algorithm was used to optimize the structural parameters, with maximum lift drag ratio and minimum drag as optimal objects. The optimal structural parameters were wingspan of 1 123 mm, sweep angle of 34°, wing height of 39 mm, and wing thickness of 3 mm. Compared with the original configuration, the average lift drag ratio was improved by 12.4%, while the average drag was reduced by 5.3%. The response surface model was validated by wind tunnel test. The numerical simulation error of lift drag ratio and drag was less than 8.0%, and the error of response surface model was less than 3%. It was shown that the response surface model had high accuracy and good versatility, and it can be used in the optimization design of vertical takeoff and landing of tailstock UAV.

Our concept of a wireless charging station (WCS) exploits the inductive power transmission (IPT) of electrical energy; the actual device principally consists of a dock and a charger. The experimental setup comprises a transmission coil operating at frequencies up to 108 kHz; a circular spiral coil on the receiving and transmitting sides; a rectifier with a step-down converter; and controllers. In terms of defining the main parameters, we compute the wireless power transfer (WPT) efficiency and simulate the magnetic field of the coils, using CST EM studio to execute the latter procedure. The behavior of the field is shown for different coil positions. As regards the functional processes, we can stress that the wireless modules communicate in the ISM band, employing GFSK modulation, and that they monitor the voltage and current in the charger, thus helping to detect improper positioning of the coils. Generally, the applied methodology and its practical embodiments may also facilitate accurate landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), substituting the landing scenario where a camera and quick response (QR) code detection are needed. Precise UAV guidance towards the station, however, requires the global position system (GPS). A minor problem emerges in relation to the energy transfer: an electromagnetic field (EMF) is generated between the coils, and this field has to be eliminated due to electromagnetic interference (EMI). Such a spurious effect may affect the guidance and information systems, possibly causing major errors in the electronics. The station is designed to recharge low voltage and low power devices, including those operating on separated extra low voltage (SELV). © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In the first phase, the Pythagorean hodograph (PH) curve was used in the path estimation process for each UAV, which also served as the input for the task allocation process. In the second phase, a task allocation algorithm based on a negotiation mechanism was proposed to assign the targets. Considering the resource requirement, time-dependent value of targets and resource consumption of UAVs, the proposed task allocation algorithm can generate a feasible allocation strategy and get the maximum system utility. In the last phase, a path planning method was proposed to generate a simultaneous arrival PH path for each UAV considering UAV's kinematic constraint and collision avoidance with obstacles.

This motivates the development of the emerging LTE-V network, a 5G cellular-based vehicular technology. However, note that the vehicular user group is typically of a very large scale, whereas the bandwidth spectrum available for vehicular communications is very limited. To efficiently allocate and utilize the slim spectrum resource to vehicle users are therefore important. This paper develops a service priority oriented spectrum allocation scheme in an LTE-V network, which explores the features of vehicular networks toward economic yet QoS guaranteed spectrum allocation. Specifically, the work exploits two features of the vehicular networks. First, vehicles in the proximity typically have similar information requirements, e.g., road conditions. As a result, the location-based multicast (i.e., geocast) could be applied to save the spectrum. Second, different types of vehicles, e.g., ambulances, buses, and private cars, are of different bandwidth and service requirements. Therefore, differential services and spectrum allocations should be applied. By jointly considering the above features, we develop a 2-D service importance oriented framework for LTE-V network spectrum allocations. The spectrum allocation issue is finally modeled as a mixed integer programming problem to maximize the system utility, and solved using an immune clonal based algorithm. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved, and using numerical results, we show that our proposal can outperform the typical heuristics-based spectrum resource allocation in terms of convergence and average delay. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Protection of real-time UAV applications against malicious attacks has become an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Denial-of-service (DoS) attack aims to exhaust system resources and cause important tasks to miss deadlines. DoS attack may be one of the common problems of UAV systems, due to its simple implementation. In this paper, we present a software framework that offers DoS attack-resilient control for real-time UAV systems using containers: ContainerDrone. The framework provides defense mechanisms for three critical system resources: CPU, memory, and communication channel. We restrict attacker's access to CPU core set and utilization. Memory bandwidth throttling limits attacker's memory usage. By simulating sensors and drivers in the container, a security monitor constantly checks DoS attacks over communication channels. Upon the detection of a security rule violation, the framework switches to the safety controller to mitigate the attack.

Radio frequency (RF) variable capacitors (varactors) can be realized in the form of metal-oxide-graphene structures [4] by exploiting the high carrier mobility and the above-stated tunable capacitance property in graphene. High-speed graphene varactors could have potential for use in beam-steering antennas and other communication devices, particularly those requiring glass or flexible substrates where integration of tuning elements would otherwise require flip-chip bonding of bulky tuning elements [5]. While conventional graphene varactors can potentially address the critical need for RF-compatible tunable elements [6], they would still need a power supply during operation.

The devices display capacitance tuning ratio of 1.5 within a \pm 2\mathrm{V} gate voltage sweep, with Dirac point (V-{\mathrm{Dirac}}) tunability of 1.7 V within the same sweep window. Furthermore a non-volatile (zero-bias) tuning ratio of 1.2 was achieved, with significant further improvement possible through design optimization.

This work mainly focuses on monitoring the internal parameters of a greenhouse which are its temperature, intensity of light, moisture level of soil, relative humidity and soil pH and upload them to a cloud to facilitate remote monitoring and enable autonomous survival of the crop by automating cooling fans, artificial lighting, heating and watering equipment. It will also enable agriculturists to grow a certain kind of crop year round irrespective of actual geographical location and realizing it in a low cost manner. Another major concern is to reduce the physical workload on farmers and prevent loss to the crop which leads to food scarcity. Green houses are artificial structures that can be viewed as short term measures against adverse environmental conditions. When implemented on a large scale, green houses have the ability to address the problems of food scarcity, damage to the crop and its yield and consequent financial distress on the farmers. They also enable farmers to be more decisive in choosing the right type of crop to cultivate without geographical location being a hurdle. Automation is proposed to eliminate the needs for manual intervention in carrying out all the tasks smoothly which are often tedious and physically demanding.

Excluding the presence of other external disturbances, this bias is largely produced by the magnetic field generated on board due to the presence of electric equipment, such as the payload and the engines, especially in very compact configurations (besides eventual uncompensated sensor offsets). Consequently, ground calibration techniques have limits. The proposed approach is conceived to rely on a simple and fast flight procedure during which all the devices operate in nominal conditions. It exploits the capability of the UAV whose magnetometers need to be calibrated (chief) to detect and track a cooperative vehicle (deputy) using a visual camera. Also, the two UAVs must fly under nominal GNSS coverage thus enabling relative positioning. By integrating deputy line-of-sight and chief/deputy differential GNSS information, the magnetic biases' determination problem can be expressed as a system of non-linear equations which is solved using a customized implementation of the well-known Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The calibration can be carried out either off-line, using the data collected in flight, or directly on board, i.e., in real time. In the latter case, the two UAVs must be able to exchange navigation data through a reliable communication link. Demonstration of feasibility and performance assessment of this method are done using data collected by means of a flight test campaign. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we investigate the anti-jamming V2V communication in an integrated UAV-CAV network with hybrid attackers, which consist of a malicious CAV with intelligent jamming capability and a malicious UAV without. To solve this problem, we propose to use a unique research tool named cognitive dynamic system (CDS), and apply its function of cognitive risk control (CRC) to develop an effective countermeasure. In each perception-action cycle (PAC), the power control will always be performed by a legitimate transmitting vehicle; meanwhile, the process of channel selection only takes place if the risk level is evaluated as high after completing the power control. This kind of design that involves task-switching is inspired by the predictive-adaptation feature of the human brain.

The initial concept of the Future Planetary Defense System (FPDS) provides for the preparation of computer physical models of the behavior of small celestial bodies including their collisions. The computer concept of the defensive space mission involves the preparation of 3D network-centric subsystems of small space vehicles as autonomous nodes connected by data transmission systems in space. As the leading technologies for connecting nodes into the system, laser and millimeter wave (MMW) technologies are proposed. The nodes of the system-space vehicles-will be equipped with very precise tools to search, detect, track, point and target dangerous asteroids. This part of the concept provides for the simulation of reactions of the defense system to the emergence of the threats to the Earth. It is fundamentally important to synchronize the system with very accurate and stable time signals from atomic and even pulsar clocks. In the scale of Solar System measurements of time, distance and angles, navigation, precise pointing, tracking and guidance are extremely difficult problems. Models of precise on-board atomic and pulsar clocks, and their synchronization are the basic problems of space metrology in their relativistic aspect. This is related to the time dilation phenomenon associated with the movement of clocks and the change in the frequency of emission and reception of signals in the gravitational field. This leads to the necessity of applying these two corrections changing the speed of the clock. We need to consider not only the system sensors, but also actuators. One of the most important aspects for consideration is the future high-power laser to combat small asteroids. The next example is a modern classic warhead to destroy the asteroid structure. In fact, there is a huge number of different problems already known, but the new one is that the computer simulation in the Solar System scale and near here to the Earth, according to the latest IAU resolutions ought to use the predictions of General Relativity in the weak-field limit: Parametrized Post-Post-Newtonian equations of ""slow"" motion.

We first derive the available range of the CNPC links between UAVs and a ground control station. The available range is defined as the maximal horizontal communication distance within which the round-Trip delay and the overall packet loss probability can be ensured with a required probability. To exploit the macro-diversity gain of the distributed multi-Antenna systems (DAS) and the array gain of the centralized multi-Antenna systems (CAS), we consider a modified DAS (M-DAS), where the ground control station is equipped with the distributed access points (APs), and each AP can have multiple antennas. We then show that the available range can be maximized by judiciously optimizing the altitude of UAVs, the duration of the uplink and downlink phases, and the antenna configuration. To solve the non-convex problem, we propose an algorithm that can converge to the optimal solution in DAS and CAS, and then extend it into more general M-DAS.

In view of its scale-up, this study was aimed at evaluating the performance of a wet-route carbonation process applied to Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) steel slag employing an operating procedure that could be adopted also at demonstrative or full scale.

In particular, there are emerging UAV applications such as aerial photograph and data relaying that require high-speed communications between the UAVs and the ground base stations (GBSs). Due to the high UAV altitude, the strong line-of-sight (LoS) links generally dominate the channels between the UAVs and GBSs, which brings both opportunities and challenges in the design of future wireless networks supporting both terrestrial and aerial users. Although each UAV can associate with more GBSs for communication as compared to terrestrial users thanks to the LoS-dominant channels, it also causes/suffers more severe interference to/from the terrestrial communications in the uplink/downlink. This paper studies the uplink communication from a multi-antenna UAV to a set of GBSs within its signal coverage by considering a practical yet challenging scenario when the number of antennas at the UAV is smaller than that of co-channel GBSs. To achieve high-rate transmission yet avoid interfering with any of the existing terrestrial communications at the co-channel GBSs, we propose a novel multi-beam transmission strategy by exploiting the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique. Specifically, the UAV sends each data stream to a selected subset of the GBSs, which can decode the UAV's signals and then cancel them before decoding the messages of their served terrestrial users, and in the meanwhile nulls its interference at the other GBSs via zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming. To draw essential insight, we first characterize in closed-form the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) achievable for the UAV's sum-rate maximization under the proposed strategy. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to jointly optimize the number of UAV data streams, the data stream-GBS association, and the transmit beamforming to maximize the UAV's transmit rate subject to the interference avoidance constraints for protecting the terrestrial users. Numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed NOMA-based multi-beam transmission strategy. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Deep neural networks (DNNs) constantly showed state-of-the-art performance over the last few years in visual machine perception, e.g., semantic segmentation. While DNNs work fine on uncorrupted data, recently introduced adversarial examples (AEs) led to misclassification with high confidence. This lack of robustness against such adversarial attacks questions the use of DNNs in safety-critical autonomous systems, e.g., autonomous driving vehicles. In this work, we address the mentioned problem with the use of a redundant teacher-student framework, consisting of a static teacher network (T), a static student network (S), and a constantly adapting student network (A). By using this triplet in combination with a novel inverse feature matching (IFM) loss, we show that a significant robustness increase of student DNNs against adversarial attacks is achieveable, while maintaining semantic segmentation quality at a reasonably high level. With our approach, we manage to increase the mean intersection over union (mean IoU) ratio between static student adversarial examples and clean images from about 35 % to about 80 % on the Cityscapes dataset.

"Automatic classification of focal liver lesions based on MRI and risk factors","2019","PLoS ONE","10.1371/journal.pone.0217053","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065918029&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0217053&partnerID=40&md5=e670a032aa3f3c85ad454d58ff32fe31","Objectives Accurate classification of focal liver lesions is an important part of liver disease diagnostics. In clinical practice, the lesion type is often determined from the abdominal MR examination, which includes T2-weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MR images. To date, only T2-weighted images are exploited for automatic classification of focal liver lesions. In this study additional MR sequences and risk factors are used for automatic classification to improve the results and to make a step forward to a clinically useful aid for radiologists. Materials and methods Clinical MRI data sets of 95 patients with in total 125 benign lesions (40 adenomas, 29 cysts and 56 hemangiomas) and 88 malignant lesions (30 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and 58 metastases) were included in this study. Contrast curve, gray level histogram, and gray level co-occurrence matrix texture features were extracted from the DCE-MR and T2-weighted images. In addition, risk factors including the presence of steatosis, cirrhosis, and a known primary tumor were used as features. Fifty features with the highest ANOVA F-score were selected and fed to an extremely randomized trees classifier. The classifier evaluation was performed using the leave-one-out principle and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results The overall accuracy for the classification of the five major focal liver lesion types is 0.77. The sensitivity/specificity is 0.80/0.78, 0.93/0.93, 0.84/0.82, 0.73/0.56, and 0.62/0.77 for adenoma, cyst, hemangioma, HCC, and metastasis, respectively. Conclusion The proposed classification system using features derived from clinical DCE-MR and T2-weighted images, with additional risk factors is able to differentiate five common types of lesions and is a step forward to a clinically useful aid for focal liver lesion diagnosis. © 2019 Jansen et al.

However, the communications between UAVs and UAVs to ground control stations mainly use radio channels, and therefore these communications are vulnerable to cyberattacks. With the advent of software-defined radio (SDR), smart attacks that can flexibly select attack strategies according to the defender's state information are gradually attracting the attention of researchers and potential attackers of UAV networks. The smart attack can even induce the defender to take a specific defense strategy, causing even greater damage. Inspired by symmetrical thinking, a solution using a software-defined network (SDN) to combat software-defined radio was proposed. We propose a network architecture which uses dual controllers, including a UAV flight controller and SDN controller, to achieve collaborative decision-making. Built on the top of the SDN, the state information of the whole network converges quickly and is fitted to an environment model used to develop an improved Dyna-Q-based reinforcement learning algorithm. The improved algorithm integrates the power allocation and track planning of UAVs into a unified action space. The simulation data showed that the proposed communication solution can effectively avoid smart jamming attacks and has faster learning efficiency and higher convergence performance than the compared algorithms. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

While adversarial examples for 2D images and CNNs have been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to 3D data such as point clouds. Given many safety-critical 3D applications such as autonomous driving, it is important to study how adversarial point clouds could affect current deep 3D models. In this work, we propose several novel algorithms to craft adversarial point clouds against PointNet, a widely used deep neural network for point cloud processing. Our algorithms work in two ways: Adversarial point perturbation and adversarial point generation. For point perturbation, we shift existing points negligibly. For point generation, we generate either a set of independent and scattered points or a small number (1-3) of point clusters with meaningful shapes such as balls and airplanes which could be hidden in the human psyche. In addition, we formulate six perturbation measurement metrics tailored to the attacks in point clouds and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithms on the ModelNet40 3D shape classification dataset. Overall, our attack algorithms achieve a success rate higher than 99% for all targeted attacks. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this article, five embedded Fiber Bragg grating sensors are installed in an unmanned aerial system wing for correlating operational conditions with structural strain in real time. Sensor locations are determined by a finite element model accounting for manufacturing limitations of the fiber line.

Recently, an autonomous vehicle logistic system (AVLS) was proposed, which employs autonomous vehicles to serve logistic requests and utilize the excessive renewable energy generated by distributed generations. In this paper, we propose an optimization problem for AVLS to develop schedules for request allocation, vehicle routing, and battery charging. By considering the unique characteristics of AVLS, the proposed scheduling problem can exploit its advantages in goods delivery and renewable energy utilization over existing logistic request allocation algorithms. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer non-linear program. To improve its scalability, we also devise a two-stage scheduling methodology to approach the optimal solutions of the original problem. We conduct comprehensive simulations to assess the performance of the proposed request scheduling problem and two-stage scheduling methodology. The results indicate that the proposed problem can improve the efficacy of AVLS in terms of total travel distance and utilized renewable energy, and the two-stage methodology can develop near-optimal solutions with notably reduced computation time. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be exploited with NOMA to improve the situation further. In this paper, we propose a UAV-assisted NOMA network, in which the UAV and base station (BS) cooperate with each other to serve ground users simultaneously. The sum rate is maximized by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and the NOMA precoding. To solve the optimization, we decompose it into two steps. First, the sum rate of the UAV-served users is maximized via alternate user scheduling and UAV trajectory with its interference to the BS-served users below a threshold. Then, the optimal NOMA precoding vectors are obtained using two schemes with different constraints. The first scheme intends to cancel the interference from the BS to the UAV-served user, while the second one restricts the interference to a given threshold. In both schemes, the non-convex optimization problems are converted into tractable ones. An iterative algorithm is designed. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for the hybrid NOMA and UAV network. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In practice, however, side-lobe cause inevitable interference to the ground users. We investigate the impact of UAVs' antenna side-lobe on the performance of UAV-enabled communication. Our analysis shows that even for a very small antenna's side-lobe gain, the ground receiver can experience substantial interference. We further show that a rather large exclusion zone is required to ensure a sufficient level of protection for the ground receiver. Nevertheless, in a multiple-antenna setting for the ground users, even when such a large exclusion zone was in place, UAVs' antenna side-lobe creates a high level of correlation among the interference signals received across receive antennas. Such a correlation limits the system ability to exploit channel diversity in a multiple-antenna setting for improving capacity. We then quantify the impact of UAVs' antenna side-lobes on the overall system performance by deriving the corresponding loss of the achieved capacity in various communications environments. We provide a new quantitative insight on the cost of adopting non-ideal UAV antenna on the overall capacity. Our analysis also shows that the capacity loss can be confined by careful selection of system parameters. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This paper proposes a novel approach to design a classifier-based system for the automated detection of CHF. Methods: The approach is founded on the use of the Stockwell (S)-transform and frequency division to analyze the time-frequency sub-band matrices stemming from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Then, the entropy features are evaluated from the sub-band matrices of ECG. A hybrid classification scheme is adopted taking the sparse representation classifier and the average of the distances from the nearest neighbors into account for the detection of CHF. The proposition is validated using ECG signals from CHF subjects and normal sinus rhythm from public databases. Results: The results reveal that the proposed system is successful for the detection of CHF with an accuracy, a sensitivity and a specificity values of 98.78%, 98.48%, and 99.09%, respectively. A comparison with the existing approaches for the detection of CHF is accomplished. Conclusions: The time-frequency entropy features of the ECG signal in the frequency range from 11 Hz to 30 Hz have higher performance for the detection of CHF using a hybrid classifier.

Visual loss is followed by epilepsy, cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and motor symptoms. We have studied the evolution of electroencephalographic (EEG) and seizure characteristics. Methods: Twenty-four patients were recruited via the Norwegian CLN3 disease parent association. Parents were interviewed. Medical records and EEG reports/recordings were collected. Electroencephalographic elements were classified according to Standardized computer-based organized reporting of EEG (SCORE). The evolution of EEG features along with seizure types was assessed by testing the difference in proportions with standardized normal deviate comparing findings below and above 15 years of age. Results: Mean age at study or death (n = 12) was 21.2 (10–39) years. Twenty-two patients had experienced seizures; the first was usually bilateral tonic–clonic (TC). Later, focal motor seizures frequently occurred, often with increasing multifocal and polymorphic features. Paroxysmal nonepileptic motor and autonomous symptoms were also suspected in several patients. Distinct myoclonic seizures were uncommon. In four patients, we identified episodes of bradycardia/sinus arrest. Electroencephalography showed progressive slowing of the background activity (p = 0.029). Focal epileptiform discharges were rare and mainly seen at age < 10. Combined multifocal and bilateral epileptiform discharges increased in adolescence (p = 0.002). Conclusion: Seizure and EEG characteristics change with time in CLN3 disease. Tonic–clonic seizures are common at onset, and multifocal motor seizures increase with age. In contrast, focal epileptiform abnormalities are more common in childhood, compared to later multifocal and bilateral discharges. This seizure disorder belongs to the combined generalized and focal epilepsies. Paucity of myoclonic seizures does not warrant classification as a classic progressive myoclonic epilepsy. When attacks with only behavior arrest occur, cardiac conduction abnormalities should be considered. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Reorganization (operationally defined using entropy) time series measured the changing system reorganisation profiles under different operator configurations and following autonomy failures. Correlations between these reorganisation profiles and team effectiveness scores describe the manner in which the system had to be coordinated to maintain effectiveness under these changing conditions. Four unplanned autonomy failures were analysed to visualise system reorganisation following a technology failure.

Based on the elliptic curve cryptography, ASUSG was designed by making full use of the scenario characteristics of stable communication link and sufficient computing resource vesting in the ground station. In ASUSG, the ground station was the key generation center, which could distribute public key to UAV instantly and assist UAVs in achieving identity authentication, establishing secure communication links and reducing the computing task of UAVs. ASWGS was designed based on identity-based encryption, in which the identity authentication and key agreement of nodes could be realized without the support of ground station using the threshold cryptography. When networking, the masking key was exploited by nodes to transmit the secret share used to generate the node’s private key in the open channel, realizing the distributed generation of the node’s private key. By presetting the share of the public key of the node in UAVs, the interference behaviors of malicious nodes were effectively prevented with less computational overhead. Security analysis demonstrated that the schemes proposed in the paper could resist many typical security threats effectively, such as identity spoofing attack, message replay attack, man-in-the-middle attack and so on. At the same time, a simulation experiment was designed on Linux platform based on the national secret algorithm. Experimental results showed that compared with the existing schemes, UAV nodes in ASUSG and ASWSG need less computational overhead in the process of key management. It can be concluded that these two schemes could achieve the authentication and secure communication of UAV networking under resource-limited scenarios. © 2019, Editorial Department of Advanced Engineering Sciences.

The effects of intensive high-amplitude oscillations of ornithopters on air-data measurements were studied in detail. The movements of an average-sized ornithopter were simulated through a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) mechanism in a wind tunnel, and measurements of an air-data system (pitot and air vane) attached to the mechanism were studied. pitot tests were conducted at different airspeeds and angles of attack (AoAs) using three pitot tubes. The same experimental conditions were created for air-vane measurements. Results revealed that within certain limits, the average measured airspeed was close to the true airspeed values. Two filters were proposed and used for real-time airspeed estimation. Based on the measurements, the oscillation amplitude of the air vane was almost twice that of the real AoA oscillations. However, the mean values of air-vane measurements and real AoAs coincided over one flapping period. For real-time estimation of AoA, which varies very fast with flapping, an estimator based on the least-squares method was implemented. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The services of IoT environments are provided through wireless networks to legal users. However, the wireless network is an open channel, which is insecure to attacks from adversaries such as replay attacks, impersonation attacks, and invasions of privacy. To provide secure IoT services to users, mutual authentication protocols have attracted much attention as consequential security issues, and numerous protocols have been studied. In 2017, Bae et al. presented a smartcard-based two-factor authentication protocol for multi-gateway IoT environments. However, we point out that Bae et al.’s protocol is vulnerable to user impersonation attacks, gateway spoofing attacks, and session key disclosure, and cannot provide a mutual authentication. In addition, we propose a three-factor mutual authentication protocol for multi-gateway IoT environments to resolve these security weaknesses. Then, we use Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic to prove that the proposed protocol achieves secure mutual authentication, and we use the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool to analyze a formal security verification. In conclusion, our proposed protocol is secure and applicable in multi-gateway IoT environments. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, the complex and changing battlefield environment greatly affects the mission execution and survivability of drone swarm. In this paper, we formulated the problem of formation reconfiguration to avoid collision with obstacles with minimum cost in a complex flight space as a two-stage stochastic programming with considering uncertain moving obstacles, where we first calculate the optimal formation parameters of the drone swarm that can avoid certain fixed obstacles with minimum reconfiguration cost in the first-stage. For the uncertain moving obstacles, we calculate the extra cost for avoiding in the second-stage after the distribution of moving obstacles is known, and add this part of the cost to the first-stage to ensure the overall reconfiguration cost is minimized. Moreover, the sample average approximation (SAA) method is exploited to solve this stochastic programming problem. Extensive experimental results from the OMNeT ++ simulation environment indicate both the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed two-stage stochastic programming approach and the better performs, compared with the existing approach. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, little is known about the progression of fatigue during automated driving and its effects on the ability to take back manual control after a take-over request. In this driving simulator study with Nö=ö60 drivers we used a three factorial 2ö×ö2ö×ö12 mixed design to analyze the progression (12ö×ö5ömin; within subjects) of driver fatigue in drivers with automation compared to manual drivers (between subjects). Driver fatigue was induced as either mainly sleep related or mainly task related fatigue (between subjects). Additionally, we investigated the drivers’ reactions to a take-over request in a critical driving scenario to gain insights into the ability of fatigued drivers to regain manual control and situation awareness after automated driving. Drivers in the automated driving condition exhibited facial indicators of fatigue after 15 to 35ömin of driving. Manual drivers only showed similar indicators of fatigue if they suffered from a lack of sleep and then only after a longer period of driving (approx. 40ömin). Several drivers in the automated condition closed their eyes for extended periods of time. In the driving with automation condition mean automation deactivation times after a take-over request were slower for a certain percentage (about 30%) of the drivers with a lack of sleep (Mö=ö3.2; SDö=ö2.1ös) compared to the reaction times after a long drive (Mö=ö2.4; SDö=ö0.9ös). Drivers with automation also took longer than manual drivers to first glance at the speed display after a take-over request and were more likely to stay behind a braking lead vehicle instead of overtaking it. Drivers are unable to stay alert during extended periods of automated driving without non-driving related tasks. Fatigued drivers could pose a serious hazard in complex take-over situations where situation awareness is required to prepare for threats. Driver fatigue monitoring or controllable distraction through non-driving tasks could be necessary to ensure alertness and availability during highly automated driving. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

Methods: We conducted a prospective, descriptive cross-sectional study, involving patients with high-risk pregnancies who had been referred to Nizwa Hospital, Oman. The selection of quality indicators was based on the prototype of clinical outcomes from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The Maternity Dashboard team adapted local parameters and used preselected general parameters, based on clinical observations, to develop the dashboard. Results: The issues posing a threat to Nizwa Hospital in becoming a world-class healthcare facility were: overbooked outpatient department, insufficient staff, and more junior doctors compared to senior doctors and consultants. Additionally, being pioneers, naturally, the dashboard development team faced difficulties while handling adverse situations. More time, guidance, and standardization of quality indicators are desirable. Conclusions: Following the approval for a Maternity Dashboard in Nizwa Hospital, the data compiled in an Excel sheet are transmitted manually every month for display on the dashboard in the delivery suite. It is intended to make data collected and dissemination completely automated in the future with the help of the Al-Shifa Healthcare Information System. Expansion of the idea of a Maternity Dashboard to other hospitals and specialties at the regional and tertiary level of the health care system in Oman and a comparison of the standard of health care provided between hospitals based on similar quality indicators would be the next milestone. © 2019, Oman Medical Specialty Board.

Unfortunately, the GNSS signal performance has the high risk of being reduced by the environmental interference. The vector tracking (VT) technique is promising to enhance the robustness in high dynamics as well as improve the sensitivity against the weak environment of the GNSS receiver. However, the time-correlated error coupled in the receiver clock estimations in terms of the VT loop can decrease the accuracy of the navigation solution. There are few works present dealing with this issue. In this work, the Allan variance is accordingly exploited to specify a model which is expected to account for this type of error based on the 1st-order Gauss-Markov (GM) process. Then, it is used for proposing an enhanced Kalman filter (KF) by which this error can be suppressed. Furthermore, the proposed system model makes use of the innovation sequence so that the process covariance matrix can be adaptively adjusted and updated. The field tests demonstrate the performance of the proposed adaptive vector-tracking time-correlated error suppressed Kalman filter (A-VTTCES-KF). When compared with the results produced by the ordinary adaptive KF algorithm in terms of the VT loop, the real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning and code-based differential global positioning system (DGPS) positioning accuracies have been improved by 14.17% and 9.73%, respectively. On the other hand, the RTK positioning performance has been increased by maximum 21.40% when compared with the results obtained from the commercial low-cost U-Blox receiver. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

A cross-sectional substudy was nested within a larger cohort study. Virologically suppressed men living with HIV (MLWH) and demographically matched HIV-negative men aged ≥50 underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 Tesla. Sequences included volumetric three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling. Regional segmentation by automated image processing algorithms was used to extract WMH volume (WMHV) and resting cerebral blood flow (CBF). The association between HIV status and WMHV as a proportion of intracranial volume (ICV; log-transformed) was estimated using a multivariable linear regression model. Thirty-eight MLWH [median age 59 years (interquartile range, IQR 55-64)] and 37 HIV-negative [median 58 years (54-63)] men were analyzed. MLWH had median CD4+ count 570 (470-700) cells/μL and a median time since diagnosis of 20 (14-24) years. Framingham 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease was 6.5% in MLWH and 7.4% in controls. Two (5%) MLWH reported a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack and five (13%) reported coronary heart disease compared with none of the controls. The total WMHV in MLWH was 1,696 μL (IQR 1,229-3,268 μL) or 0.10% of ICV compared with 1,627 μL (IQR 1,032-3,077 μL), also 0.10% of ICV in the HIV-negative group (p = .43). In the multivariable model, WMHV/ICV was not associated with HIV status (p = .86). There was an age-dependent decline in cortical CBF [-3.9 mL/100 mL/min per decade of life (95% confidence interval 1.1-6.7 mL)] but no association between CBF and HIV status (p > .2 in all brain regions analyzed).

Nowadays, UAVs are now more easily accessible to the public and thus numerous new applications in civilian and commercial domains have emerged, with typical examples including film shooting, agricultural inspection, electrical inspection, personal photography, weather monitoring, forest fire detection, traffic control, cargo transport, emergency search and rescue. However, while a UAV gives people all kinds of conveniences, the cyber security problem of the UAV is gradually exposed. That is, cyber security is critically important for the success of the UAVs. In this article, we first give a state-of-the-art overview of UAV development, introduces the composition structure and various applications of the UAVs, and discuss the cyber security threats faced by the UAVs from the aspects of confidentiality, integrity and availability. In particular, this paper presents the cyber security threats, existing security protection measures, and the current research progress at home and abroad on the UAVs from the four aspects (i.e., sensor node, communication link, software and network) in details. Here we consider the sensor security of the UAVs as an example. Firstly, multiple sensor devices such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers and barometers are often used in the design of the UAVs in order to achieve various functions. The erroneous data collected by a sensor node may make the UAV to make a wrong decision, which affects the flight safety of the UAV and even lead to its crash. The traditional sensor security research generally focuses on the security of data transmission in the sensor networks, but often ignores the security threat analysis and protection of the sensor node itself. In addition, due to technical or cost constraints, commercial sensors in a UAV are usually unable to distinguish normal and abnormal information. We have summarized and analyzed the current situation of the research on the sensors used in the UAVs. At present, there are two kinds of cyber security attacks for the UAVs, which are ultrasonic jamming on gyroscope and GPS deception. we have developed a low-cost record-and-replay system based on a software defined radio device. Also, this article reports the experimental results of some cyber security attacks and defense mechanisms on the UAVs. Especially, global positioning system (GPS) spoofing attack and defense on the UAVs are described in details. Moreover, our proposed UAV control system and its experimental results are described. This system does not need any physical contact or other electronic intrusion of the UAV system, and this method is applicable to most of the UAV models based on satellite navigation signal for navigation. The system can avoid the weaknesses of other UAV control methods such as resulting in UAV falling out of control and causing secondary disasters. Finally, the future research directions of the UAV security and management are discussed. Work in this direction is still in its early stages, and thus we hope this paper will stimulate further interest from researchers and engineers. © 2019, Science Press.

We present a novel autonomous aerial vehicle system—TrackerBots—to track and localize multiple radio-tagged animals. The simplicity of measuring the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values of very high frequency (VHF) radio-collars commonly used in the field is exploited to realize a low-cost and lightweight tracking platform suitable for integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Due to uncertainty and the nonlinearity of the system based on RSSI measurements, our tracking and planning approaches integrate a particle filter for tracking and localizing and a partially observable Markov decision process for dynamic path planning. This approach allows autonomous navigation of a UAV in a direction of maximum information gain to locate multiple mobile animals and reduce exploration time and, consequently, conserve on-board battery power. We also employ the concept of search termination criteria to maximize the number of located animals within power constraints of the aerial system.

These applications demand unprecedented precise, reliable and secure positioning, with localization requirements below 1 m. This stringent demand is pushing for the use of road-side units (RSUs) from fifth generation and vehicular networks for accurate vehicle localization. However, these networks are not typically designed for positioning but for data communication purposes, which follow a different paradigm for the network deployment and operation. This paper provides design guidelines on dedicated network deployments with the aim of achieving accurate vehicle-to-infrastructure positioning in road scenarios. First, the network layout or site placement is assessed with a geometrical metric. Then, the minimum density of RSUs along the road is bounded with line-of-sight probability models for urban street and highway scenarios. Finally, the Cramér-Rao bound for joint time-of-arrival (ToA) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) localization is used to maximize the distance between RSUs along the road, by exploiting multi-antenna deployments. According to the simulation results, the network sites are recommended to be located at alternate sides of the road, with a maximum distance between RSUs of 40 and 230 m for urban and rural environments, respectively. Following these design guidelines, there is also the need to exploit antenna arrays to combine uplink ToA and AoA estimates, in order to ensure a vehicle location accuracy below one meter on the 95% of the cases. The use of eight antenna elements at the RSUs is found to reduce nearly one and a half times the minimum network density in highway localization deployments. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The realization of automatic driving of underground mine vehicles can improve mining automation and intelligence and ensure safety of workers, and it can significantly increase mining and exploitation efficiency. Automatic driving of underground mining vehicles requires the technologies of location, communication, navigation, and path following control. Automatic driving of mining vehicles is the ultimate approach of autonomous navigation and auto driving, while path following control system is one of the core technologies of the autopilot system. The path following control system is a multi-variable, multi-constraint system. There are optimization problems under multiple constraints as well as challenges such as actuator saturation during the control process. To solve the above problems, a model predictive control method was introduced in this paper. By considering the relationship between the position and situation of the vehicle, the objective function of the predictive control was optimized by minimizing the lateral deviation of the following path and the heading angle deviation of the vehicle. Therefore, the optimal controls of vehicle speed and articulation angle were obtained, and the problem of multi-variable and multi-constraint system was solved. For the tracking overshoot problem caused by the inability of determining sudden changes of road curvature in the model predictive control strategy, a control method based on preview distance was proposed; thus, the vehicle path following control accuracy and stability was improved through the advance judgment of road mutation information. Matlab/Adams simulation software was used to perform a comparison simulation test. The results show that the model predictive following controller is capable of solving the control problem in multi-variable, multi-constrained system and effectively prevent the actuator saturation. Moreover, the model predictive following control strategy based on the preview distance keeps the horizontal deviation of the vehicle within ±0.04 m and the heading angle deviation within ±1.8°. Compared with the controller before improvement, the lateral position deviation is reduced by 80.9%, and the heading angle deviation is reduced by 59.1%; this proves that the improved controller has better lateral stability and accuracy. © All right reserved.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Due to the tremendous growth of various vehicular applications, a huge amount of data is generated through advanced on-board devices and is deemed critical to improve driving safety and enhance vehicular services. However, cloud based models often fall short in applications where latency and mobility are critical. In order to fully realize the potential of vehicular networks, the challenges of efficient communication and computation need to be addressed. In this direction, vehicular fog computing (VFC) has emerged which extends the concept of fog computing to conventional vehicular networks. It is a geographically distributed paradigm that has the potential to conduct time-critical and data-intensive tasks by pushing intelligence (i.e. computing resources, storage, and application services) in the vicinity of end vehicles. However secure and reliable transmission are of significant importance in highly-mobile vehicular networks in order to ensure the optimal Quality of Service (QoS). In this direction, several authentication mechanisms have been proposed in the literature but most of them are found unfit due to absence of decentralization, anonymity, and trust characteristics. Thus, an effective cross-datacenter authentication and key-exchange scheme based on blockchain and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is proposed in this paper. Here, the distributed ledger of blockchain is used for maintaining the network information while the highly secure ECC is employed for mutual authentication between vehicles and road side units (RSUs). Additionally, the proposed scheme is lightweight and scalable for the considered VFC setup. The performance evaluation results against the existing state-of-the-art reveal that the proposed scheme accomplishes enhanced security features with reduced computational and communicational overheads. Further, its extensive evaluation on the widely applicable Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool guarantee its safeness against different attack vectors. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Generally, when UAV reconnaissance, attack or material delivery to multiple targets, its flight path planning problem is transformed into Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP), but the coverage radius of UAV is not considered, and there may be path intersection and targets covered repeatedly in the planned path. Aiming at the problem of UAV path planning when considering UAV coverage radius, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise(DBSCAN) are proposed to solve UAV flight path planning problem combined with geometric judgment, which can better solve the problem of path intersection in TSP, and the problem of targets covered repeatedly without considering UAV coverage radius, to achieve the goal of no intersection path and shorter path length. Python programming simulation is carried out for the proposed method, and the experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively avoid the problems flight path intersection and targets covered repeatedly, and greatly shorten the flight path length of UAV, which will greatly improve the flight efficiency of UAV. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Researchers and industry try to come with solutions to be one step in front of attackers but they do not always succeed. Sensors are the preferred devices for attackers because of their limited capabilities. Traditional security mechanisms do not work on these and therefore, dedicated solutions need to be created. For this reason, this paper proposes a solution for mitigating internal attacks that affect wireless sensors. With the aid of a trust-based security mechanism, compromised sensors can be detected and excluded before they can make more damage in the environment. The novelty of the proposition comes from the fact that is developed for environments that uses unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to collect data. Current literature did not tackle with trust management in UAV-sensor communication and for this reason this paper can represent the first brick on a subject of great interest. The proposition uses both direct and indirect trust values for determining the final trust value. Results demonstrate that the proposition is energy efficient and can limit the damage produced by an attack. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, they also suffer from blurry images in dynamic scenes which leads to visual discomfort and hampers further image processing. Previous works have succeeded in monocular deblurring, yet there are few studies on deblurring for stereoscopic images. By exploiting the two-view nature of stereo images, we propose a novel stereo image deblurring network with Depth Awareness and View Aggregation, named DAVANet. In our proposed network, 3D scene cues from the depth and varying information from two views are incorporated, which help to remove complex spatially-varying blur in dynamic scenes. Specifically, with our proposed fusion network, we integrate the bidirectional disparities estimation and deblurring into a unified framework. Moreover, we present a large-scale multi-scene dataset for stereo deblurring, containing 20,637 blurry-sharp stereo image pairs from 135 diverse sequences and their corresponding bidirectional disparities. The experimental results on our dataset demonstrate that DAVANet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and model size. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, whether there are differences in their representation and activity in the prognostically-favorable isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutated compared to-wild type GBMs is unknown. Studies on human specimens of untreated IDH-mutant GBMs are rare given they comprise 10% of all GBMs and often present at lower grades, receiving treatments prior to dedifferentiation that can drastically alter microglia and macrophage phenotypes. We were able to obtain large samples of four previously untreated IDH-mutant GBM. Using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence techniques with automated segmentation protocols that quantify at the individual-cell level, and comparison between single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) databases of human GBM, we discerned dissimilarities between GBM-associated microglia and macrophages (GAMMs) in IDH-mutant and-wild type GBMs. We found there are significantly fewer GAMM in IDH-mutant GBMs, but they are more pro-inflammatory, suggesting this contributes to the better prognosis of these tumors. Our pro-inflammatory score which combines the expression of inflammatory markers (CD68/HLA-A,-B,-C/TNF/CD163/IL10/TGFB2), Iba1 intensity, and GAMM surface area also indicates that more pro-inflammatory GAMMs are associated with longer overall survival independent of IDH status. Interrogation of scRNA-seq databases demonstrates microglia in IDH-mutants are mainly pro-inflammatory, while anti-inflammatory macrophages that upregulate genes such as FCER1G and TYROBP predominate in IDH-wild type GBM. Taken together, these observations are the first head-to-head comparison of GAMMs in treatment-naïve IDH-mutant versus-wild type GBMs. Our findings highlight biological disparities in the innate immune microenvironment related to IDH prognosis that can be exploited for therapeutic purposes. © 2019 Impact Journals LLC.

Autonomy and networking are crucial aspects to consider in order to overcome the challenges typical of the marine environment, such as the limitations in underwater communications. This paper addresses both these aspects, describing the cooperative autonomy architecture and the strategies of the AUVs of the CMRE Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) network. We report tests from the LCAS18 trial. In this trial, cooperative strategies were supported by data sharing, facilitating track classification and the creation of a common tactical picture. The CMRE intelligent Cooperative Autonomous Decision Making Engine (iCADME) controlled the various phases of the robot mission. The produced tracks were classified in real-time and the ones likely to be generated by a target were selected to trigger a cooperative track prosecution strategy. The final objective was to facilitate track-to-track associations for the final target confirmation. To support cooperative autonomy, in LCAS18, the novel CMRE Cognitive Communication Architecture (CCA) was used in the CMRE ASW network for the first time. CCA managed the communications, with the aim of improving the use of the available bandwidth.The results from LCAS18 are one of the first examples in literature demonstrating the potentials of cooperative autonomy strategies and data fusion in realistic surveillance scenarios. Only autonomous decisions can in fact improve the mission performance when a reliable communication channel with the Command and Control centre cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, cooperative decisions and data sharing allow to exploit the spatial diversity that robotic networks can provide.  © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Existing decision-making models are based on fully allocated assignment without considering the weapon consumption and communication delay, which does not conform to the actual naval combat process. The minimum opponent residual threat probability and minimum own-weapon consumption are selected as two functions of the multi-objective decision-making model in this paper. Considering the impact of the communication delay, the multi-objective discrete particle swarm optimization (MODPSO) algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution of the distribution scheme with different weapon consumptions. The algorithm adopts the natural number coding method, and the particle corresponds to the confrontation strategy. The simulation result shows that underwater communication delay impacts the decision-making selection. It verifies the effectiveness of the proposed model and the proposed multi-objective discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm. © 2019 by the authors.

The threatened Western Swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio) feeds on rice, inducing crop damage and leading to decreases in rice production. Due to the Swamphen protection status, economic compensation policies have been put in place to compensate farmers for these damages, thus requiring an accurate, quantitative, and cost-effective evaluation of rice crop losses over large territories. We used information captured from a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) equipped with a multispectral Parrot SEQUOIA camera as ground-truth information to calibrate Sentinel-2 imagery to quantify damages in the region of Ebro Delta, western Mediterranean. UAV vegetation index NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) allowed estimation of damages in rice crops at 10 cm pixel resolution by discriminating no-green vegetation pixels. Once co-registered with Sentinel grid, we predicted the UAV damage proportion at a 10 m resolution as a function of Sentinel-2 NDVI, and then we extrapolated the fitted model to the whole Sentinel-2 Ebro Delta image. Finally, the damage predicted with Sentinel-2 data was quantified at the agricultural plot level and validated with field information compiled on the ground by Rangers Service. We found that Sentinel2-NDVI data explained up to 57% of damage reported with UAV. The final validation with Rangers Service data pointed out some limitations in our procedure that leads the way to improving future development. Sentinel2 imagery calibrated with UAV information proved to be a viable and cost-efficient alternative to quantify damages in rice crops at large scales. © 2019 by the authors.

In the OR of the future, not only will data enrichment and information integration play a role, but so will the incorporation of high-tech medical devices. Their use and the information they generate are simplified, while at the same time, further clinical data are optimized before, during, and after the surgical procedure. Specially designed intuitive user interfaces, automated workflows, and advanced imaging techniques allow the full potential of diagnostic, surgical, and postoperative patient data to be exploited. New surgical planning technology helps ENT surgeons to more easily evaluate complex anatomical structures and more accurately and quickly diagnose conditions. Based on an adaptable anatomical software model, a multitude of anatomical structures can be identified and segmented as objects. The high accuracy and consistency of identification of these objects make segmentation an integral part of precise treatment planning. With modern planning software, in 3D patient images, tumors and structures at risk can be accurately contoured, trajectories planned, and CT and MR images fused and subsequently easily accessed in the OR for further use. This serves as a guide during surgery and ultimately results in improved patient safety and more efficient routine clinical workflows. © 2019, The Author(s).","Review","Final","Scopus"

Performance of modern robotic manipulators has enabled research and development of fast automated non-destructive testing (NDT) systems for complex geometries. This paper presents recent outcomes of work aimed at removing the bottleneck due to data acquisition rates, to fully exploit the scanning speed of modern 6-DoF manipulators. The geometric assessment of the parts is carried out with a robotised dynamic laser scanner encoded through an absolute laser tracker. This method allows scanning speeds up to 330mm/s at 1mm pitch. State of the art ultrasonic instrumentation has been integrated into a large robot cell to enable fast data acquisition, high scan resolutions and accurate positional encoding. A fibre optic connection between the ultrasonic instrument and the server computer enables data transfer rates up to 1.6 GB/s. The robotic inspection system presented herein is currently being tested for industrial exploitation. The adopted system integration strategies allow traditional ultrasonic phased array scanning as well as full matrix capture (FMC) and other novel scanning approaches (e.g. multi-Tx phased array). Scan results, relative to a 1.2m x 3m carbon fibre sample, are presented.

To resolve this issue, a framework of uncertainty-based design optimization (UBDO) is developed based on an adjusted polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method. Design/methodology/approach: The γ ̄Re-θt transition model combined with the shear stress transport k-ω turbulence model is used to predict the laminar-turbulent transition. The particle swarm optimization algorithm and PCE are integrated to search for the optimal NLF airfoil. Using proposed UBDO framework, the aforementioned problem has been regularized to achieve the optimal airfoil with a tradeoff of aerodynamic performances under fully turbulent and free transition conditions. The tradeoff is to make sure its good performance when early transition to turbulence on surfaces of NLF airfoil happens. Findings: The results indicate that UBDO of NLF airfoil considering Mach number and lift coefficient uncertainty under free transition condition shows a significant deterioration when complicated flight conditions lead to early transition to turbulence. Meanwhile, UBDO of NLF airfoil with a tradeoff of performances under both fully turbulent and free transition conditions holds robust and reliable aerodynamic performance under complicated flight conditions. Originality/value: In this work, the authors build an effective uncertainty-based design framework based on an adjusted PCE method and apply the framework to design two high-performance NLF airfoils. One of the two NLF airfoils considers Mach number and lift coefficient uncertainty under free transition condition, and the other considers uncertainties both under fully turbulent and free transition conditions. The results show that robust design of NLF airfoil should simultaneously consider Mach number, lift coefficient (angle of attack) and transition location uncertainty. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Consequently, reacquisition, where potential contacts need to be revisited for identification, becomes time consuming when using sensors with a small swath width. This paper focuses on decreasing the time required for reacquisition and identification by correcting for position errors on the identification vehicle. This is achieved by autonomously performing feature-based navigation and in-situ adaptive path planning with AUVs. Both the search AUV and the identification AUV automatically interpret side looking sonar data on-board to build maps of detected contacts and reference bathymetric features, or landmarks, during a mission. Feature position information is exchanged between the vehicles through underwater acoustic communication. The identification AUV performs in-situ, optimized path planning for reacquiring potential threats detected by the search vehicle, while using the reference positions of the search vehicle for its navigation.

Hence, Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) is often applied to remove the perspective effect from a vehicle's front-facing camera and to remap its images into a 2D domain, resulting in a top-down view. Unfortunately, however, this leads to unnatural blurring and stretching of objects at further distance, due to the resolution of the camera, limiting applicability. In this paper, we present an adversarial learning approach for generating a significantly improved IPM from a single camera image in real time. The generated bird'seye-view images contain sharper features (e.g, road markings) and a more homogeneous illumination, while (dynamic) objects are automatically removed from the scene, thus revealing the underlying road layout in an improved fashion.

This is due to the lack of existing knowledge about flight under variable weather conditions. A bias in the existing tests has been the non-reproducibility of the same climatic conditions.

By exploiting neural network (NN) to approximate the nonlinear terms existing in the highly nonlinear multi-UAVs system, a distributed neural adaptive control scheme is proposed when only a subset of follower UAVs has access to the leader UAV's states. To solve the problem of 'explosion of complexity' in traditional backstepping architecture and reduce the number of online updating parameters of NN, dynamic surface control (DSC) and minimal learning parameter techniques are employed to reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore, by combining graph theory and Lyapunov approach, it is proved that velocities and altitudes of all follower UAVs can track the velocity and altitude of the leader UAV.

Autonomous driving systems are equipped with a large suite of sensors to obtain robustness and redundancy. Ultrasonic sensors are commonly used because of their low-cost and reliability of near-field distance estimation. However, machine learning algorithms are not commonly used for ultrasonic data, as it requires extensive datasets whose creation is time-consuming, expensive and inflexible to hardware and environmental changes. On the other hand, there exists no method to simulate these signals deterministically. Thus, we present a novel approach for synthetic ultrasonic signal simulation using conditional GANs (cGANs). To the best of our knowledge, we present the first realistic data augmentation for automotive ultrasonics sensors. The performance of cGANs allows us to bring the environment simulation to a high quality close to realistic data. By using our setup and environmental parameters as condition, the proposed approach is flexible to external influences. Due to its low complexity and smaller time effort needed for data generation, the proposed method outperforms other simulation algorithms such as finite element method. We verify the outstanding accuracy and realism of our method by applying a detailed statistical analysis and comparing the generated data to an extensive amount of measured signals. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

We present SoPhie; an interpretable framework based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which leverages two sources of information, the path history of all the agents in a scene, and the scene context information, using images of the scene. To predict a future path for an agent, both physical and social information must be leveraged. Previous work has not been successful to jointly model physical and social interactions. Our approach blends a social attention mechanism with physical attention that helps the model to learn where to look in a large scene and extract the most salient parts of the image relevant to the path. Whereas, the social attention component aggregates information across the different agent interactions and extracts the most important trajectory information from the surrounding neighbors. SoPhie also takes advantage of GAN to generates more realistic samples and to capture the uncertain nature of the future paths by modeling its distribution. All these mechanisms enable our approach to predict socially and physically plausible paths for the agents and to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several different trajectory forecasting benchmarks. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

An alternative is to utilize Long Wave Infrared thermal vision which is unaffected by darkness and can penetrate most obscurants. However, utilization of thermal vision is mostly considered in combination with traditional visual-inertial odometry frameworks which are made for grayscale visible-light camera images and fail to utilize the full (e.g. 14-bit) radiometric information of a thermal camera system. Using rescaled thermal images makes the data compatible with existing vision-based odometry solutions yet comes at a cost of information loss which in turn can lead to unreliable tracking of image correspondences and thus to odometry estimation failure. An alternative is to use direct methods exploiting the full radiometric information provided by a thermal camera. This paper presents a comparative study between state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry frameworks applied on rescaled thermal camera data against full radiometric information-based methods using a modified filter-based estimator and a recently proposed keyframe-based direct technique specifically designed for thermal-inertial localization. In a data-driven manner we demonstrate that direct full radiometric information-based thermal-inertial localization should be the prime selection especially in hard environments with weak thermal gradients.

However, current mainstream semantic segmenters are normally benchmarked against datasets with narrow Field of View (FoV), and most vision-based navigation systems use only a forward-view camera. In this paper, we propose a Panoramic Annular Semantic Segmentation (PASS) framework to perceive the entire surrounding based on a compact panoramic annular lens system and an online panorama unfolding process. To facilitate the training of PASS models, we leverage conventional FoV imaging datasets, bypassing the effort entailed to create dense panoramic annotations. To consistently exploit the rich contextual cues in the unfolded panorama, we adapt our real-time ERF-PSPNet to predict semantically meaningful feature maps in different segments and fuse them to fulfill smooth and seamless panoramic scene parsing. Beyond the enlarged FoV,we extend focal length-related and style transfer-based data augmentations, to robustify the semantic segmenter against distortions and blurs in panoramic imagery.

As the major vehicular communication solution, long-term evolution (LTE)-V2X continues to use the coordinated multi-point joint transmission (CoMP-JT) introduced in LTE to reduce the handover delay at the base station (evolved node B, eNB) and mitigate the low quality of throughout in a high-speed moving scenario by employing the joint transmission technique during the handover process. However, the current security key management scheme in the LTE standard does not satisfy the requirements of the key management scenario in the CoMP-JT process. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel handover key generation and update scheme that can be used for CoMP-JT handover in LTE-V2X communication. Before transmission handover, the serving eNB and target eNB should each have a public-private key pair based on their location information and also share a re-encryption key. Subsequently, the moving vehicle generates a handover request, which is encrypted with the public key of the target eNB, the shared key, and a random number. The handover request will be broadcasted to the serving and target eNBs. The target eNB can recover the shared key and calculate the subsequent session key from the received ciphertext with its private key. Synchronously, the vehicle calculates the subsequent session key based on the location information of the target eNB and the random number used to generate the handover request. With this proposed scheme, the separation of forward/backward key can be achieved without reduction of the diversity gain achieved from joint transmission handover. In other words, the session key is generated by the vehicle and transmitted to the eNBs involved securely. In this study, the scheme for key generation and update was verified and analyzed based on cryptography theory and the capability of establishing a secure communication session between the vehicle and eNB without disrupting the separation of backward/forward keys in the process of handover during LTE-V2X CoMP-JT was demonstrated. The performance evaluation shows that compared with traditional schemes, the proposed scheme can reduce the communication delay introduced by the transmission handover process by 26.4%, and also reduce channel loading between the vehicle and target eNB by almost 50%. Moreover, with the increase in the number of vehicles in the cell range, the channel loading of the base station increases linearly, which improves the applicability of the scheme in the LTE-V2X vehicular networking scenario. © 2019, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

The expected ubiquity of such systems raises concerns about their safety, and the ability of such autonomous systems to operate safely in densely populated areas (where their value will be greatest). In this paper, we outline a new framework aiming to add an additional layer of safety to aerial systems operated by a human pilot or autopilot by monitoring the UAVs environment for visual cues, and monitoring the human pilot for signs of distraction. The system will endow a UAS with the ability to reason about its safety, and the consequences of safety failures during its operation. The UAS will furthermore continuously reason about possible safety maneuvers in response to likely failures - in the event of an emergency, the vehicle can then execute its last safe maneuver, thus reducing the systems impending danger. Embedding consequence awareness in sUAS is an obvious appeal to safer and more insurable missions.

The key idea of the proposed method is to improve the accuracy of the object detection by exploiting the 3D global context provided by the whole set of Lidar points. The overall structure of the proposed method consists of two parts: 1) the detection core network (DetNet) and 2) the context extraction network (ConNet). First, the DetNet generates the BEV representation by projecting the Lidar points into the BEV plane and applies the CNN to extract the feature maps locally activated on the objects. The ConNet directly processes the whole set of the Lidar points to produce the 1 × 1× k feature vector capturing the 3D geometrical structure of the surrounding in the global scale. The context vector produced by the ConNet is concatenated to each pixel of the feature maps obtained by the DetNet. The combined feature maps are used to regress the oriented bounding box and identify the category of the object.

For solving this problem, the UAV parachute recovery system was divided into the parachute and UAV, and the dynamics model of the parachute was established by the relationship between the drag area and the inflating time. First, based on the method of multibody dynamics, the UAV was divided into a multibody system, including the left wing, right wing and fuselage, and its high angle of attack dynamics model was optimized by the coefficient of flow around a flat plate. Second, the models of each body were introduced into the center of mass of the entire parachute recovery system by the partial velocity matrices. Finally, based on Kane equation, a six-degree-of-freedom model of the parachute recovery system was derived and established and the effects of the altitude and wind on the parachute recovery system dynamics were considered. Through the comparison of numerical simulation and experimental data, it is found that the two have good consistency, and this dynamics model can provide guidance for the UAV parachute recovery. © 2019, Editorial Board of JBUAA.

While deep learning for perception has been shown to be vulnerable to a host of subtle adversarial manipulations of images, end-to-end demonstrations of successful attacks, which manipulate the physical environment and result in physical consequences, are scarce. Moreover, attacks typically involve carefully constructed adversarial examples at the level of pixels. We demonstrate the first end-to-end attacks on autonomous driving in simulation, using simple physically realizable attacks: the painting of black lines on the road. These attacks target deep neural network models for end-to-end autonomous driving control. A systematic investigation shows that such attacks are surprisingly easy to engineer, and we describe scenarios (e.g., right turns) in which they are highly effective, and others that are less vulnerable (e.g., driving straight). Further, we use network deconvolution to demonstrate that the attacks succeed by inducing activation patterns similar to entirely different scenarios used in training. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Although a Dolev-Yao intruder with unlimited resources can trivially render any service unavailable, DoS attacks do not necessarily have to be carried out by such (extremely) powerful intruders. It is useful in practice and more challenging for formal protocol verification to determine whether a service is vulnerable even to resource-bounded intruders that cannot generate or intercept arbitrary large volumes of traffic. This paper proposes a novel, more refined intruder model where the intruder can only consume at most some specified amount of resources in any given time window. Additionally, we propose protocol theories that may contain timeouts and specify service resource usage during protocol execution. In contrast to the existing resource-conscious protocol verification models, our model allows finer and more subtle analysis of DoS problems. We illustrate the power of our approach by representing a number of classes of DoS attacks, such as, Slow, Asymmetric and Amplification DoS attacks, exhausting different types of resources of the target, such as, number of workers, processing power, memory, and network bandwidth. We show that the proposed DoS problem is undecidable in general and is PSPACE-complete for the class of resource-bounded, balanced systems.

The changes in mobility conditions are expected to have an impact on urban development and, more specifically, on location choices, land use organisation and infrastructure design. Nowadays, there is not enough data for a real-life assessment of this impact. Experts estimate that autonomous vehicles will be available for uptake in the next decade. Therefore, urban planners should consider the possible impacts from autonomous vehicles on cities and the future challenges for urban planning. In this context, the present paper focuses on the challenges from the implementation of autonomous road vehicles for passenger transport in European cities. The analysis is based on a systematic review of research and policy. The main outcome of the analysis is a set of challenges for urban planning regarding the features of urban development, the local and European policy priorities, the current lack of data for planning and the potential for autonomous vehicles to be used by planners as data sources.

Prediction is challenging due to the difficulty in modeling various driving behavior, or learning such a model. The model should be interactive and reflect individual differences. Imitation learning methods, such as parameter sharing generative adversarial imitation learning (PS-GAIL), are able to learn interactive models. However, the learned models average out individual differences. When used to predict trajectories of individual vehicles, these models are biased. This paper introduces an adaptable generative prediction framework (AGen), which performs online adaptation of the offline learned models to recover individual differences for better prediction. In particular, we combine the recursive least square parameter adaptation algorithm (RLS-PAA) with the offline learned model from PS-GAIL.

However, recently researchers have discovered and demonstrated some attacks on vehicles, which have caused a panic among the public. Furthermore, these attacks have demonstrated that the security issue is still one of the major challenges of vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel edge computing based anomaly detection, coined edge computing based vehicle anomaly detection (EVAD), which exploits edge based sensor data fusion to identify the anomaly events. The time domain property, i.e., the correlation between different intra-vehicle sensors, and the frequency domain property of sensor data are utilized to judge whether an anomaly has occurred within the vehicle. Especially, to reduce the computation overhead and improve the performance, multiple sensors will be organized as ring architecture, which is a tradeoff of detection accuracy and complexity. In addition, the major components (e.g., anomaly detection module) of EVAD are embedded in edge computing devices, which make the anomaly detection be more efficient and privacy preserving. Meanwhile, a more appropriate model is generated on the cloud server, of which computation overhead maybe heavy for edge computing devices. This paper evaluates the performance of EVAD under different scenarios, and the experimental results demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency.

Ever since the multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS) was introduced in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), continuing work on the multicast transmission has been done and its importance is growing in the fifth generation (5G) cellular networks. The use cases of multicast transmission have been enlarged from mobile TV and public safety to vehicular-to-everything (V2X) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Recently, for group communications in public safety networks and for geographical information sharing in automotive, airborne and social networks, multicast transmission has been targeted at fewer users in a relatively small area, which has stimulated extensive research on the single-cell multicast transmission scheme. In the proposed single-cell multicast transmission scheme, a supplementary multicast channel is additionally assigned in a single-cell multicast transmission scheme to exploit channel diversity. The resource allocation is adaptive to the channel variations of the users (responsive to users QoS needs), using channel feedback from the users, in contrast with previous approaches where resources were determined conservatively. An optimal resource allocation problem to minimize the required bandwidth while enabling every user to obtain the target multicast rate is formulated as a convex problem and an iterative algorithm is proposed in a computationally efficient way. Performance is evaluated mathematically and through intensive simulations, where other cell interference is considered using a fluid model. The proposed single-cell multicast transmission scheme provides benefits in comparison to existing multicast schemes in the simulations, under a set of various parameters including the number of multicast users and channel correlation between the multicast channels. © 2019 by the authors.

In this system, the speed, acceleration, relative distance between the subject and lead vehicles under car-following condition, and the driver's reaction time were obtained to calculate the safe braking and safe lane-changing distances, to determine the time required for the respective actions. On this basis, the braking hazard coefficient B and the lane-change risk coefficient S were introduced to evaluate the risk in braking and lane changing, respectively. This makes the risk degree of rear-end collision and the threshold of active intervention more intuitive. According to the variation in the expected lateral acceleration and lateral displacement of the vehicle, the 5 times polynomial method was used to plan the collision avoidance path, adaptive to the driver's lane-changing behavior. To ensure the safety and comfort of the driver during the lane-changing collision avoidance process, the maximum lateral acceleration of the trajectory was constrained. Linear tracking control was adopted to avoid collision and ensure the stability of the vehicle. To achieve this, the feed-forward control strategy was established based on the steady-state dynamic model of the vehicle, and the position and yaw angle deviations of the lane-changing path were eliminated by combining the linear feedback and feed-forward controls. Correct the reference path to realize the collision avoidance control of the straight lane scene. The experiments by simulation and real vehicle cross-validation demonstrate that the fifth-order polynomial lane-changing path based on the driver's desired lateral acceleration and the expected lateral displacement is in good agreement with the driver's actual collision avoidance path.

We evaluate both the pure compression performance using typical metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM) and others, but also the performance of a subsequent perception function, namely a semantic segmentation (characterized by the mean intersection over union (mIoU) measure). Not surprisingly, for all investigated compression methods, a higher bitrate means better results in all investigated quality metrics. Interestingly, however, we show that the semantic segmentation mIoU of the GAN autoencoder in the highly relevant low-bitrate regime (at 0.0625 bit/pixel) is better by 3.9 % absolute than JPEG2000, although the latter still is considerably better in terms of PSNR (5.91dB difference). This effect can greatly be enlarged by training the semantic segmentation model with images originating from the decoder, so that the mIoU using the segmentation model trained by GAN reconstructions exceeds the use of the model trained with original images by almost 20 % absolute. We conclude that distributed perception in future autonomous driving will most probably not provide a solution to the automotive bus capacity bottleneck by using standard compression schemes such as JPEG2000, but requires modern coding approaches, with the GAN encoder/decoder method being a promising candidate. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

We track two-dimensional object shapes on pixel level exploiting instance-aware semantic segmentation techniques and optical flow cues. We apply Structure from Motion (SfM) to object and background images to determine initial camera poses relative to object instances as well as background structures and refine the initial SfM results by integrating stereo camera constraints using factor graphs. We compute object trajectories using stereo sequence constraints of object and background reconstructions. We show qualitative results using publicly available video data of driving sequences.

There have been different kinds of attacks on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV or drone) Network (UAVNet) or a Flying ad hoc network (FANET) in the recent past. The rational solution to such problems is identifying the strategies that can be chosen by the attacker, and selecting a defensive response that is most apt and intelligent while considering all the choices that a target's defensive mechanisms can make. This paper is an attempt to identify a game like situation, when a single UAV is under a DDoS attack, while a genuine UAVNet is trying to communicate with it. Two different cases of this common attack are simulated, namely, UDP flooding, and ICMP (Ping) flooding. In both cases, the intensity of these attacks is gauged with different choices made by the attacker and the target alike.

Effective design for adequate, robust, and consistent communications from the drones to the control center (aka server) is thus necessary to facilitate the implementation of the UAV system. Multipath TCP has the potential to exploit heterogeneous wireless paths and achieve robust bandwidth by controlling the dynamics of the convoy of drones. In this paper, we make use of fluid approach for proposing a generic system architecture toward a control mechanism for coordinating the convoy of drones. Moreover, we model multipath TCP and study their applications for the control scenario of a convoy of drones with three different communication interfaces, representing the head, tail, and the middle of the convoy. The access is through a satellite and several WiFi access points (APs) communicating to the server with time-variant wireless channel, subject to the dynamic mobility and distance of APs from the convoy's head and tail. The traffic on different paths governed by the flow control based on the movement and position of the convoy enable us to investigate the performance and convergence of communication system dynamics. In particular, Lyapunov theory is adopted to derive the stability conditions of the dynamics over the mobility of the convoy. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The propulsive wing unmanned air vehicle is a completely new class of unmanned air vehicle, making disruptive changes in the aircraft industry. It is based on a distributed cross-flow electric fan propulsion system. When the fan starts to operate, the flow is drawn from the suction surface, provided by energy through the fan and expelled out of the airfoil trailing edge (TE). This causes a significant lift increase and drag reduction with respect to ordinary aircrafts, making it perfect for applications requiring low cruise speed such as firefighting, agriculture, and aerial photography. In this early stage of the investigation, our main aim is to prove that this design is applicable and the expected aerodynamic and propulsion improvements are achievable. This is done through a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics investigation of the flow around an airfoil with an embedded cross-flow fan near its TE. A scaled wind tunnel model of the same geometry used in the computational fluid dynamics investigation was manufactured and used to perform wind tunnel testing. The computational fluid dynamics and wind tunnel results are compared for validation. Furthermore, an unmanned air vehicle model was designed and manufactured to prove that the propulsive wing concept is flyable. The article shows that the aerodynamic forces developed on the cross-flow fan airfoil are not only functions of Reynolds number and angle of attack as for standard airfoils but also function of the fan rotational speed. The results show the great effect of the rotational speed of fan on lift augmentation and thrust generation through the high momentum flow getting out of the fan nozzle. Wind tunnel tests show that the suction effect of the fan provides stall free operation up to very high angles of attack (40 degrees) leading to unprecedented values of lift coefficient up to 5.8. The flight test conducted showed the great potential of the new aircraft to perform the expected low cruise speed and high angles of attack flight. © The Author(s) 2019.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Various solution paradigms have been proposed by the scientific community to solve this well established problem. Some of the commonly used techniques are based on Bayesian inference, specifically the particle filter as it has the advantage of modeling arbitrary distributions without the unimodal assumption limitation. The particle filter has proven to be successful in many applications, however, a large set of particles is required in order to have robust estimates against noisy measurements and erroneous data association, which impedes the runtime performance of the filter. This study shows that a learning framework that trains a recurrent neural network with labeled data generated from the probabilistic estimation of a particle filter is capable of exploiting the expressive power of neural networks in order to capture the behavior of the filter and handle the noisy sensory information. The trained model is capable of performing the estimation with lower runtime complexity, making it applicable to numerous autonomous systems. This approach also proves to be helpful in situations when the ground truth data can not be accessed. We train and evaluate our strategy using raw GPS sensor measurements from the Oxford RobotCar dataset. The results show that the performance of the recurrent network closely matches that of the particle filter without exhaustive tuning and that the network is able to generalize effectively on test datasets as well. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Such approaches have limited trajectory options, hence limited accuracy, and could deliver only one payload with one airdrop. The Samara Autorotating Wings (SAW) is disposable type of aerial deployment system proposed in this paper to drop light-weight electronic payloads to remote locations accurately. Using autorotation as its main technique of lift creation, the concept borrows the natural dispersion method from maple seeds and takes advantage of the gyroscopic stability of a spinning mass. It does not require any propulsion system on-board and is equipped with an actuator to change the angle of attack of the wing for directional control. The concept also features a collaborative autorotation mode whereby multiple wings are attached together to form a larger rotor hub that benefits from increased angular momentum and control authority which is especially important at higher altitudes where the air is less dense. Although there have been other works on using autorotation to deliver payloads, this is the first documented effort in using a collaborative form of autorotation. The chordwise geometrical wing shape of SAW is optimized to achieve the maximum lift force during its autorotating descent. A nonlinear control method is conceived to regulate the descent direction and speed of SAW. This proposed control scheme enables an omni-directional guide slope, allowing SAW to be more maneuverable than parafoils or fixed-wing type of aerial deployments. SAW with different numbers of wings are tested against each other for drop characteristics and control performance, in simulated models and in physical experiments that involve a vertical wind tunnel with and integrated motion-captured system and free-fall drop tests. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Reliability in a wireless link can be improved substantially if a large degree of channel diversity can be exploited. The V2X sidelink can offer numerous independent communication links between a target car and its neighbours, and the diversity offered by these links can be made available by cooperative retransmission of data packets received from a prior multi-cast transmission. This paper elaborates on the value of user cooperation in the sidelink for attaining ultra-reliability in V2X communications by analysing the reliability gains in dependence of the number of cooperating users and for considering an additional retransmission, if the latency budget allows. Analysis reveals that the attainable gains scale with up to one order of magnitude per cooperative user. If strong differences in the power per link due to path-loss effects are taken into account, gains are obviously degrading, though the degradation can be kept at a moderate level if an additional retransmission with appropriate user grouping is considered. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

It defines a set of bi-directional messages exchanged between a UAV (aka drone) and a ground station. The messages carry out information about the UAV's states and control commands sent from the ground station. However, the MAVLink protocol is not secure and has several vulnerabilities to different attacks that result in critical threats and safety concerns. Very few studies provided solutions to this problem. In this paper, we discuss the security vulnerabilities of the MAVLink protocol and propose MAVSec, a security-integrated mechanism for MAVLink that leverages the use of encryption algorithms to ensure the protection of exchanged MAVLink messages between UAVs and GCSs. To validate MAVSec, we implemented it in Ardupilot and evaluated the performance of different encryption algorithms (i.e. AES-CBC, AES-CTR, RC4 and ChaCha20) in terms of memory usage and CPU consumption. The experimental results show that ChaCha20 has a better performance and is more efficient than other encryption algorithms. Integrating ChaCha20 into MAVLink can guarantee its messages confidentiality, without affecting its performance, while occupying less memory and CPU consumption, thus, preserving memory and saving the battery for the resource-constrained drone. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

UAV has been widely used in military and civilian fields such as surveillance, patrol, battlefield attacking and environment monitoring. However, it cannot finish the jobs if the multimedia transmission task, especially the image transmission task, doesn't work properly. The image transmission task ensures that UAV captures image information successfully from the environment. Therefore, as one of the important indexes to judge the multimedia quality, the reliability of image transmission task determines the mission execution capability of UAV. And it is of great significance to research the reliability of image transmission task of UAV. Since the image transmission task is executed on the basis of avionics system, this paper will study the reliability modeling of image transmission task based on UAV avionics system.

However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure the avionic software against security threats. There are no airworthiness certification criteria for the security as well as the safety of UAVs.

The integrated airworthiness certification criteria for safety and security in avionic software to save time and cost were most recently proposed.

It derives the security objectives and requirements for UAVs’ avionic software based on the result of the security risk assessment.

To support such coordination, ETSI is currently defining the Maneuver Coordination Service (MCS). The current approach is based on a distributed solution where vehicles coordinate their maneuvers using V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) communications. This paper proposes to extend this concept by adding the possibility for the infrastructure to support cooperative maneuvers using V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) communications. To this aim, we propose a Maneuver Coordination Message (MCM) that can be used in cooperative maneuvers with or without road infrastructure support. First results show the gains that cooperative maneuvers can achieve thanks to the infrastructure support. This paper also analyses and discusses the need to define MCM generation rules that decide when MCM messages should be exchanged. These rules have an impact on the effectiveness of cooperative maneuvers and on the operation and scalability of the V2X network. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The agent can use multiple modes of transportation in a dynamic transit vehicle network. For instance, a drone can either fly or ride on terrain vehicles for segments of their routes. DREAMR is a difficult problem of sequential decision making under uncertainty with both discrete and continuous variables. We design a novel hierarchical hybrid planning framework to solve the DREAMR problem that exploits its structural decomposability. Our framework consists of a global open-loop planning layer that invokes and monitors a local closed-loop execution layer. Additional abstractions allow efficient and seamless interleaving of planning and execution. We create a large-scale simulation for DREAMR problems, with each scenario having hundreds of transportation routes and thousands of connection points. Our algorithmic framework significantly outperforms a receding horizon control baseline, in terms of elapsed time to reach the destination and energy expended by the agent. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The discussion is based on issues that have surfaced within the Swedish research project Autonomy and responsibility. The paper argues that the concept ‘autonomous ships’ has become an indicator of that seafarers soon will become obsolete – which may have negative consequences for the supply of maritime competence in coming years ‐ and that the proper definition of the term ‘autonomous’ describes something that will never apply to a ship. Ships can be given the possibility, but hardly the full right or condition of self-government. It is argued that ‘smart ships’, or perhaps ‘intelligent ships’, are more appropriate, since these terms describe the current and future state of technology without predicting how humans will prefer to use it. The estimated timeframes for implementation of unmanned ships suggest no threat to the seafaring occupation for coming generation. The content of the occupation will of course change due to the phase of implementation of degree of digitalization, but there will always be a need for maritime knowledge and understanding. © 2019, Faculty of Navigation, Gdynia Maritime University.

This study investigates the effects of the propeller advance ratio on the vortex properties and vortex breakdown above a generic 55° sharp-edged non-slender delta wing UAV model. The experiments were conducted in a closed circuit UTM-LST wind tunnel at the wind speeds of 15 m/s, 20 m/s and 25 m/s respectively at various angles of attack ranging from 0° to 18°. In this project, the propeller is installed in front of the UAV model. Two measurement techniques were employed on the model; steady balance measurement and surface pressure measurement. The experimental data highlight the effects of propeller advance ratio on lift, drag, pitching moment and vortex characteristics of the UAV model. The results from the steady balance data showed that the propeller advance ratio has increased the lift and drag coefficients respectively. The results from the surface pressure measurement have showed that the propeller advance ratio influences the development of the primary vortex above the delta-winged model. The main observation from this study was the vortex breakdown developed in the trailing edge has been much influenced by the propeller advance ratio. © 2019, The Aeronautical and Astronautical Society of the Republic of China.

In this context, network optimization is essential to efficiently employ network resources, relying whenever possible on automated procedures and exploiting open application programming interfaces (APIs) inherent of SDN/NFV ecosystems. Automated network optimization procedures on top of network controllers promote a client layer of third-party applications that enable optimization-as-a-service (OaaS) business opportunities.

Such modalities can be extracted via a diverse range of sensors and images. Currently, there are no (or only a few) studies that have been done to increase the land cover classification accuracy via unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-digital surface model (DSM) fused datasets. Therefore, this study looks at improving the accuracy of these datasets by exploiting convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we focus on the fusion of DSM and UAV images for land use/land cover mapping via classification into seven classes: bare land, buildings, dense vegetation/trees, grassland, paved roads, shadows, and water bodies. Specifically, we investigated the effectiveness of the two datasets with the aim of inspecting whether the fused DSM yields remarkable outcomes for land cover classification. The datasets were: (i) only orthomosaic image data (Red, Green and Blue channel data), and (ii) a fusion of the orthomosaic image and DSM data, where the final classification was performed using a CNN. CNN, as a classification method, is promising due to hierarchical learning structure, regulating and weight sharing with respect to training data, generalization, optimization and parameters reduction, automatic feature extraction and robust discrimination ability with high performance. The experimental results show that a CNN trained on the fused dataset obtains better results with Kappa index of ~0.98, an average accuracy of 0.97 and final overall accuracy of 0.98. Comparing accuracies between the CNN with DSM result and the CNN without DSM result for the overall accuracy, average accuracy and Kappa index revealed an improvement of 1.2%, 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively.

Due to the strong line-of-sight (LoS) air-to-ground (A2G) channels, the UAV may impose/suffer more severe uplink/downlink interference to/from the cellular base stations (BSs) as compared to the ground users. To tackle this challenge, we propose in this paper to apply the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique to the uplink communication from a UAV to cellular BSs, under spectrum sharing with the existing ground users. However, for our considered system, traditional NOMA with only local interference cancellation (IC) at individual BSs, termed non-cooperative NOMA, may provide very limited gain compared to the orthogonal multiple access (OMA). This is because there are a large number of co-channel BSs due to the LoS A2G channels, and thus, the rate performance of the UAV is severely limited by the BS with the worst channel condition with the UAV. To mitigate the UAV's uplink interference without significantly compromising its achievable rate, a new cooperative NOMA scheme is proposed in this paper by exploiting the existing backhaul links among BSs. Specifically, some BSs with better channel conditions are selected to decode the UAV's signals first, and then forward the decoded signals to their backhaul-connected BSs for IC. To investigate the optimal design of cooperative NOMA and air-ground performance tradeoff, we maximize the weighted sum-rate of the UAV and ground users by jointly optimizing the UAV's rate and power allocations over multiple resource blocks as well as their associated BSs. However, this problem is difficult to be solved optimally. To obtain useful insights, we first consider two special cases with egoistic and altruistic transmission strategies of the UAV, respectively, and solve their corresponding problems optimally. Next, we consider the general case and propose an efficient suboptimal solution by applying the alternating optimization and successive convex approximation techniques. Numerical results show that the proposed cooperative NOMA scheme yields significant throughput gains than those by the traditional OMA as well as the non-cooperative NOMA benchmark. © 2019 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In order to achieve this purpose, various object detection methods are required to perform the extraction task from the VHR images. Traditional pixel-based and object-based classification methods capture little high-level semantic concepts, making it intractable to extract unhealthy vegetation areas. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a novel method based on the scene level in the framework of the CNN by using adaptively weighted enhanced global and local deep features to extract vegetation areas attacked by pests and diseases from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) VHR remote sensing images. To be specific, the last convolutional feature maps of VGG-16 network are firstly extracted as the original features. Then, the learned original features are used for clustering to obtain the scene features, which are regarded as the global features to estimate whether the target object appears in the scene image. Next, each pixel features at different locations of feature maps are used for clustering again to form the object features, which are regarded as local features to determine what the target object is and supplement the global feature with the local information. Afterwards, the shape information of central object in scene image, quantified by the roundness value, is utilized as the foundation of weighting, which can distinguish the different objects with similar spectral and texture feature to some extent.

The necessity for the NOMA transmitter to gather information on user channel quality becomes a major drawback in practical deployments. We therefore consider various limited feedback schemes for NOMA transmission, to relieve the complexity of tracking and feeding back the full channel state information (CSI) of the users. In particular, through beamforming we allow NOMA to exploit the space domain, and hence, the user angle emerges as a promising (yet novel) limited feedback scheme. We show that as the user region for NOMA transmission gets wider, the users become more distinctive at the transmitter side with respect to their angles, making user angle feedback a better alternative than distance feedback in such scenarios. We rigorously derive and analyze the outage sum rate performance for NOMA transmission considering various user ordering strategies involving full CSI, angle, and distance feedback schemes. Our analytical results for NOMA outage sum rates using those feedback schemes match closely with simulations, and provide useful insights on properly choosing a limited feedback scheme for different deployment geometries and operating configurations. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In contrast to traditional machine learning methodologies based on a suite of carefully selected attributes, deep learning is based on the raw images themselves. Deep CNNs are currently the tools of choice for computer vision tasks such as self-driving cars. Unfortunately, deep learning is encumbered by jargon that is unfamiliar to most geoscientists, providing black box applications resulting in two common reactions: deep learning models are the solution for everything or deep learning models are a modern fad that discards the interpreter's insight or experience with a given problem. In this presentation, we show that CNN models are based on attributes similar to those we use in seismic interpretation and remote sensing. We also show that through a process called transfer learning based on the analysis of 2D colour images, we can exploit much of the previous work developed for image recognition applications to rocks. We illustrate the successful use of transfer learning to microfossil classification, core description, petrographic analysis, and hand specimen identification. We also discuss some of the challenges in CNN analysis of 3D seismic data volumes. © 81st EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2019. All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

A major part of this momentum is the autonomous driving of railway vehicles to enable energy efficiency and safety. The derivation of an energy-optimal solution to the intelligent train driving problem in an efficient fashion, however, proves to be a significant challenge due to the high dimension, nonlinearity, complex constraints, time-varying characteristics as well as the limited computing power of onboard computers. This paper proposes a human experience driven fuzzy strategy tree framework for online generation of the energy optimized driving solution for railway trains. Starting from the frequent driving patterns of human drivers, we propose a fuzzy strategy tree structure to effectively encode the driving strategy for different working conditions. The strategy tree is built with an error driven Ripple Down Rules (RDR) method through trip simulations. The genetic algorithm is exploited to optimize the strategy parameters. We also incorporate fuzzy inference methods to handle the uncertainty of a trip. An onboard automatic controller searches the fuzzy strategy tree according to the route information to identify an optimized driving strategy for detailed control operations. Such hybrid techniques make it feasible to identify and apply the best practices of human drivers under a computation-efficient framework. The proposed techniques are validated by field test on commercial trains and enable an energy saving of over 10%. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To achieve precise control of the parawing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), the accuracy of the dynamic model of the parafoil system is improved. Taking the leading edge incision and the trailing edge deflection into account, the lift and drag coefficients are calculated by combining the computational fluid dynamics with the lifting-line theory. The least square method is used to identify the relationships between the lift and drag coefficients and the angle of attack, the size of the incision and the brake deflection, realizing the accurate calculation of the aerodynamic parameters of the canopy.

But Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant manufacturing of clinical-grade NK cells in high numbers for patient treatment is still a challenge. Therefore, new protocols for isolation and expansion of NK cells are required. In order to attack resistant tumor entities, NK cell killing can be improved by genetic engineering using alpharetroviral vectors that encode for chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). The aim of this work was to demonstrate GMP-grade manufacturing of NK cells using the CliniMACS® Prodigy device (Prodigy) with implemented applicable quality controls. Additionally, the study aimed to define the best time point to transduce expanding NK cells with alpharetroviral CAR vectors. Manufacturing and clinical-scale expansion of primary human NK cells were performed with the Prodigy starting with 8-15.0 × 109 leukocytes (including 1.1-2.3 × 109 NK cells) collected by small-scale lymphapheresis (n = 3). Positive fraction after immunoselection, in-process controls (IPCs), and end product were quantified by flow cytometric no-wash, single-platform assessment, and gating strategy using positive (CD56/CD16/CD45), negative (CD14/CD19/CD3), and dead cell (7-aminoactinomycine [7-AAD]) discriminators. The three runs on the fully integrated manufacturing platform included immunomagnetic separation (CD3 depletion/CD56 enrichment) followed by NK cell expansion over 14 days. This process led to high NK cell purities (median 99.1%) and adequate NK cell viabilities (median 86.9%) and achieved a median CD3+ cell depletion of log -3.6 after CD3 depletion and log -3.7 after immunomagnetic CD3 depletion and consecutive CD56 selection. Subsequent cultivation of separated NK cells in the CentriCult® chamber of Prodigy resulted in approximately 4.2-8.5-fold NK cell expansion rates by adding of NK MACS® basal medium containing NK MACS® supplement, interleukin (IL)-2/IL-15 and initial IL-21. NK cells expanded for 14 days revealed higher expression of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, and NKG2D) and degranulation/apoptotic markers and stronger cytolytic properties against K562 compared to non-activated NK cells before automated cultivation. Moreover, expanded NK cells had robust growth and killing activities even after cryopreservation. As a crucial result, it was possible to determine the appropriate time period for optimal CAR transduction of cultivated NK cells between days 8 and 14, with the highest anti-CD123 CAR expression levels on day 14. The anti-CD123 CAR NK cells showed retargeted killing and degranulation properties against CD123-expressing KG1a target cells, while basal cytotoxicity of non-transduced NK cells was determined using the CD123-negative cell line K562. Time-lapse imaging to monitor redirected effector-to-target contacts between anti-CD123 CAR NK and KG1a showed long-term effector-target interaction. In conclusion, the integration of the clinical-scale expansion procedure in the automated and closed Prodigy system, including IPC samples and quality controls and optimal time frames for NK cell transduction with CAR vectors, was established on 48-well plates and resulted in a standardized GMP-compliant overall process. © Olaf Oberschmidt, et al. 2019; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2019.","Article","Final","Scopus"

A Spatial Refined Voting Mechanism (SRVM) is designed for standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to overcome the defects of local optimal and slow convergence. For each generation candidate particle positions are recorded and an adaptive cube is formed with own adaptive side length to indicate occupied regions. Then space voting begins and is sorted based on voting results, whose centers with bigger voting counts are seen as sub-optimal positions. The average of all particles of corresponding dimensions are calculated as the refined solutions. A time coordination method is developed by generating specified candidate paths for every UAV, making them arrive the same destination with the same time consumption. A spatial-temporal collision avoidance technique is introduced to make collision free. Distance to destination is constructed to improve the searching accuracy and velocity of particles. In addition, the objective function is redesigned by considering the obstacle and threat avoidance, Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA), separation maintenance and UAV self-constraints. Experimental results prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm. © 2019","Article","Final","Scopus"

The communication systems between vehicles and infrastructure present remote attack access for malicious hackers to exploit system vulnerabilities. Increased connectivity combined with autonomous driving functions pose a considerable threat to the vast socioeconomic benefits promised by CAVs. However, the absence of historical information on cyber-attacks mean that traditional risk assessment methods are rendered ineffective. This paper proposes a proactive CAV cyber-risk classification model which overcomes this issue by incorporating known software vulnerabilities contained within the US National Vulnerability Database into model building and testing phases. This method uses a Bayesian Network (BN) model, premised on the variables and causal relationships derived from the Common Vulnerability Scoring Scheme (CVSS), to represent the probabilistic structure and parameterisation of CAV cyber-risk. The resulting BN model is validated with an out-of-sample test demonstrating nearly 100% prediction accuracy of the quantitative risk score and qualitative risk level. The model is then applied to the use-case of GPS systems of a CAV with and without cryptographic authentication. In the use case, we demonstrate how the model can be used to predict the effect of risk reduction measures. © 2018 The Authors","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, the flow above the delta wing is governed by complex leading-edge vortex structures which result in complicated aerodynamics behaviour. At higher angles of attack, the vortex burst can take place when the swirling flow is unable to sustain the adverse pressure gradient. More studies are needed to understand these vortex phenomena. This paper addresses an experimental study of active flow control called propeller on a generic 55° swept angle sharp-edged delta wing model. In this experiment, a propeller was placed at two different locations. The first location was at the apex of the wing while the second position was at the rear of the wing. The experiments were conducted in a 1.5 x 2.0 m2 closed-loop wind tunnel facility at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. The freestream velocities were set at 20 m/s and 25 m/s. The research consisted of an intensive surface pressure measurement above the wing surface to investigate the effects of rotating propeller towards the leading-edge vortex. The experiments were divided into four configurations. The clean wing configuration was performed without the propeller and followed by pusher-propeller configuration using 10-inch 9-inch propellers. The final configuration was the tractor-propeller with a 10-inch propeller. The results emphasise the influences of the propeller size and its location corresponding to vortex properties above the delta-winged UAV model. The findings had indicated that the vortex peak is increased when the propeller is installed for both pusher and tractor configurations. The results also indicate that the pressure coefficient is increased when the propeller advance ratio increases. © Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Malaysia.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Errors in a CNN execution can modify the way the vehicle sense the surrounding environment, potentially causing accidents or unexpected behaviors. The high computational requirements of CNNs combined with the need to perform detection in real-time allow little margin for implementing error detection. In this paper, we present an extremely efficient error detection solution for CNN based on the observation that, in the absence of errors, the differences between the input frames and the detection provided by the CNN should be strictly correlated. In other words, if the image between two subsequent frames does not change significantly, the detection should also be very similar. Similarly, if the detection varies considerably from a frame to the next, then the input image should also have been different. Whenever input images and output detection don't correlate we can detect a error. After formalizing and evaluating the inter-frame and output correlation thresholds, we implement and validate the detection strategy, utilizing data from previous radiation experiments. Exploiting the intrinsic efficiency in processing images of devices used to execute CNNs, we can detect up to 80% of errors while adding low overhead. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Towards investigating power efficient deployment strategies for such a system, the contribution of this article is twofold: we formalize the relevant multi-objective optimization problem, and secondly develop Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based techniques for optimization of the individual objectives, which are then exploited in an iterative manner. The relevant optimization objectives for reducing the total power consumed are the number of base stations (BSs) and their transmit powers. The optimization is performed while assuring minimum quality-of-service constraints (QoSs) such as per-user coverage probability and per-user rate. Through system level simulations, we show that the developed approach ensures great reductions for both the number of base stations as well as their individual transmit power, thus saving initial deployment cost as well as reducing operational costs induced due to energy consumption. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The in-vehicle microenvironment that is in close proximity to traffic emission sources is at particular risk of increased exposure to traffic-related air pollutants (TRAPs). In this study, a mobile measurement campaign was carried out to investigate in-vehicle exposure to TRAPs in China where the elevated level of TRAPs has drawn worldwide attention in recent years. Our analysis demonstrates that vehicle ventilation mode (i.e., mechanical ventilation, natural ventilation, hybrid ventilation, and infiltration)played a critical role in determining the level of in-vehicle exposure. Although the outside air (OA)mode of mechanical ventilation provided adequate air exchange to passengers, the average in-vehicle PM2.5 and UFP concentrations (119 μg/m3 and 97,227 cm−3 on freeway, and 93 μg/m3 and 42,829 cm−3 on local roadway)during a 20-min sampling period were observed at the level that are markedly greater than those from studies conducted in the U.S., posing a serious health threat to vehicle occupants. We elaborated how our results collected in China with a significantly more polluted on-road environment differ from existing studies in terms of ventilation and driving conditions. In addition, we made the first effort to examine in-vehicle exposure under hybrid ventilation that is a common ventilation practice in everyday commute to potentially reduce symptoms similar to sick building syndrome (SBS). Our data indicate that vehicle occupants under hybrid ventilation are at much greater risk of TRAPs exposure if operating in a polluted on-road environment, and we call for future research on automated ventilation system with advanced window control especially for vans and buses with a large cabin volume. © 2019 The Authors","Article","Final","Scopus"

This paper proposes a very low-cost multiband sensor developed on a Raspberry device and two Raspberry Pi 3 cameras that can be used in photogrammetry from drone applications. The UAV-integrated radiometric sensor and its performance were tested in in two villages of South-west Niger for the detection of temporary surface water bodies (or Ephemeral water bodies): zones of seasonal stagnant water within villages threatening the viability and people's health. The Raspberry Pi 3 cameras employed were a regular RGB Pi camera 2 (Red, Green, Blue) and a NoIR Pi 3 camera v2 (regular RGB without IR filter) with 8MPX resolution. The cameras were geometrically calibrated and radiometrically tested before the survey in the field. The results of the photogrammetry elaborations were 4 orthophotos (a RGB and NoIRGB orthophoto for each village). The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was calculated. The index allowed the localization and the contouring of the temporary surface water bodies present in the villages. The data were checked against the data collected with a Sony (ILCE-5100). Very high correspondence between the different data was detected.

The presented contribute aims at exploiting the potentialities of spherical images and videos acquired using a 360° camera mounted on board of a medium-sized Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). More specifically, the focus has been the development and testing of a rapid-mapping hybrid system, capable of fast acquisition of data from both the on-board sensors. The reduction of the data acquisition time has been, and still is, a hot topic faced by the researchers in the Geomatics community, especially linked to some hazardous operative scenarios, where the reduction of the time on the field is crucial for operators' safety reasons (like in post-earthquake early damage assessment surveys). After a deep analysis of the available scientific literature, it turned out that researchers have been more focused on terrestrial applications of these emerging sensors (360° cameras), and no significant studies for aerial application have been conducted yet. First of all, some laboratory tests have been carried out, in order to evaluate the metric accuracy of the 3D models generated using the employed 360° sensor; thereafter, a solution for acquiring spherical images from 360° camera mounted on a light UAV has been designed.

In fact, it has been shown that an ordinary GPS can be easily spoofed by a low-cost, open-source based software defined radio (SDR) system such as bladeRF and HackRF [3, 4] which can cause serious complications to the navigation system of the car especially for self-driving cars which are driven based on the information from sensors, cameras, and GPS. In this work, we design a new GPS authentication system called lightweight authentication GPS (AuthGPS) to authenticate GPS signal against GPS spoofing and LTE base station broadcast message spoofing. In the past, there have been many successful attempts on GPS spoofing which resulted in shifting the destination of the car to the spoofer's desired location. In a case where the car is connected to the Internet via LTE network, the navigation system can find out if the GPS is spoofed by acquiring the correct GPS satellite information from LTE base stations' location information. However, a skillful attacker can spoof the LTE base station signals [7] as well using another SDR which will produce spoofed LTE base station information. Hence giving wrong information about GPSinformation according to the will of the attacker. Currently, there are defense methods against the GPS spoofing [6]. One of them is signal-processing-based methods. By monitoring unusual or unreasonable signal changes at GPS receivers, GPS spoofing attack can be detected. Received Power Monitoring (RPM) looks at all the received amplitude and automatic gain control (AGC) setpoint [1]. The receiver will sense drastic power jump if a spoofing attack occurs. However, an overly powerful spoofing attack with noise is not detectable in the case of this mechanism. Another way to detect spoofing is the symmetric-key encryption mechanism of GPS signals. According to previous research [2], encrypted precision code for anti-spoofing referred to as P(Y) code, might not be able to be spoofed. A spoofing attack can be detected by calculating cross-correlation between spoofed coarse/acquisition code, referred to as C/A code, and P(Y) code. Unfortunately, this P(Y) code is only for military purpose while the C/A code can be publicly accessible. This method requires knowledge of specific key which is not revealed to the public to decrypt P(Y) code. Monitoring the direction of arrival of the signals can be one of the methods [6]. A GPS receiver measures the direction-of-arrival vector with more than 3 antennas. Even though this signal-geometrybased system with multiple antennas makes GPS robust, an attacker can spoof signals from multiple directions, which is more difficult to detect the spoofing. The idea here is to develop a system that can discriminate the spoofed signal without complex computation or heavy message exchange. An important component of AuthGPS is a verification of valid GPS satellite information via LTE base stations' location information. We propose 6-digit one-time password-based authentication system in this paper. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This scholarship, however, has yet to properly clarify both the explicit and tacit role of reciprocal risk within this moral determination. A systematic explanation is needed of the function of risk in the right to kill in war. This article engages with the in bello component of the Just War Tradition to determine: first, the role of reciprocal risk in the moral justifications for killing in war; and, second, the extent to which these justifications may be challenged within conditions of radical asymmetry, exemplified today by the unmanned aerial vehicle exclusive violence of the US. The first three sections of this article each review an account of Just War: conventionalism, revisionism and contractarianism. It is argued that the coherence of each of these moral accounts, particularly in terms of the permissiveness of inter-combatant violence, is grounded in an assumption of collective reciprocal risk. Radically asymmetric conditions of battle render ambiguous what would otherwise be a morally unproblematic use of military violence. This article will conclude by highlighting how this challenge manifests in practice, through analysis of the ongoing unmanned aerial vehicle exclusive violence of the US. The radical differentials of physical risk that characterise this violence threaten to erode the capacity of the US to interpret and apply standard judgements of Just War theory against those it targets. © The Author(s) 2018.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Research on high-reliability organizations has identified multiple challenges in reaching these goals simultaneously, because automation often renders organizations’ operations “mindless” and unable to cope gracefully with changing, complex situations characteristic of high-risk domains. In digital operations, a special challenge arises from the “frame problem” connected with the inability of algorithms to adapt to environments not identified within their developers’ initial cognitive frames. An exploratory, theory-generating case study was conducted within a computer security company (F-Secure) to examine how organizations acting in digital domains may achieve high reliability by mitigating the frame problem. This article examines digital organizing of the epistemic and pragmatic features of operations, along with arrangements of these features that respond to the frame problem. Collective mindfulness is identified as emerging in such a sociotechnical setting via a carefully layered, systemic constellation of (human) mindful and (digital) mindless operations while the organization’s core operations remain digital and algorithmic. The findings point to heretofore unexplored reliability challenges associated with digital organizing, alongside several relevant ways to overcome and/or mitigate them. ©2019.

The highways are severely threatened by rockfalls or landslide events after the 2017 Ms 7.0 Jiuzhaigou earthquake. Field survey (September 14–18th, 2017, May 15–20th, 2018, and September 9–17th, 2018), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and satellite image identified high-relief rockfalls and road construction rockfalls or landslides along the highway. Rockfall hazard is qualitatively evaluated using block count, velocity, and flying height through a 3D rockfall simulation at local and regional scales. Rockfall risk is quantitatively assessed with rockfall event probability, propagation probability, spatial probability, and vulnerability for different block volume classes. Approximately 21.5%, 20.5%, and 5.3% of the road mileage was found to be subject to an unacceptable (UA) risk class for vehicles along S301, Z120, and Z128 highways, respectively. Approximately 20.1% and 3.3% of the road mileage belong to the UA risk class for tourists along Z120 and Z128 highways, respectively. Results highlighted that high-relief rockfall events were intensively located at K50 to K55 (Guanmenzi to Ganheba) and K70 to K72 (Jiudaoguai to Shangsizhai Village) road mileages along S301 highway and KZ18 to KZ22 (Five Flower Lake to Arrow Bamboo Lake) road mileages, KZ30 (Swan Lake to Virgin Forests), and KY10.5 kilometers in Jiuzhai Valley. Rockfalls in these locations were classified under the UA risk class and medium to very high hazard index. Road construction rockfalls were located at K67 (Jiuzhai Paradise) and K75–K76 kilometers along S301 highway and KZ12 to KZ14 (Rhino Lake to Nuorilang Waterfall), KZ16.5 to KZ17.5 (Golden Bell Lake), KY5 (Lower Seasonal Lake), and KY14 (Upper Seasonal Lake) kilometers along Z120 and Z128 highway in Jiuzhai Valley. Rockfalls in these areas were within a reasonable practicable risk to UA risk class and very low to medium hazard index. Finally, defensive measures, including flexible nets, concrete walls, and artificial tunnels, could be selected appropriately on the basis of the rockfall hazard index and risk class. This study revealed the integration between qualitative rockfall hazard assessment and quantitative rockfall risk assessment, which is crucial in studying rockfall prevention and mitigation. © 2019, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

One of the major obstacles to success for a smart city is to tackle the mobility and accessibility issues via 'smart mobility' solutions. At the verge of the age of smart urbanism, autonomous vehicle technology is seen as an opportunity to realize the smart mobility vision of cities. However, this innovative technological advancement is also speculated to bring a major disruption in urban transport, land use, employment, parking, car ownership, infrastructure design, capital investment decisions, sustainability, mobility, and traffic safety. Despite the potential threats, urban planners and managers are not yet prepared to develop autonomous vehicle strategies for cities to deal with these threats. This is mainly due to a lack of knowledge on the social implications of autonomous capabilities and how exactly they will disrupt our cities. This viewpoint provides a snapshot of the current status of vehicle automation, the direction in which the field is moving forward, the potential impacts of systematic adoption of autonomous vehicles, and how urban planners can mitigate the built environment and land use disruption of autonomous vehicles. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To mitigate such attacks and enhance network-layer trust of NDN-based UAANETs, this article proposes a novel and systematic framework that integrates interest-key-content binding (IKCB), forwarding strategy, and on-demand verification to efficiently discover poisoned content. To further provide decentralized IKCB store and detect internal attackers, we introduce a lightweight permissioned blockchain system over NDN and develop a scalable adaptive delegate consensus algorithm.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have proven to be useful in monitoring disaster status and providing decision-making support for emergency rescue, because they are able to arrive at floods area timely, obtain flood images and videos quickly, low-risk to operate and flexible to carry out different sensors. The important roles of UAV in emergency rescue have been widely recognized. However, the lack of available UAV resources nearby at the sudden onset of floods seriously limits the capability of UAVs' rapid response to flood disasters. For addressing this challenge, a multi- UAVs remote sensing observation network is highly required, and now has been planned in China to enhance our ability of emergency response. Key problems include where and how to allocate UAVs resources such that the UAVs can reach destination timely when floods occur. To help close this gap, we proposed to build a number of UAV airports in China to establish a remote sensing observation network of UAVs. Field stations of Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) were considered as the potential locations of UAV airports because of their extensive geographical distribution and good cooperation with the UAV application and regulation research center of CAS. With the available flood risk prevention data, administrative division data, CAS field stations data and the UAV database as data sources, we created a fishnet of 0.5° multiply 0.5° to discretize administrative divisions and regarded the central points of these grids as potential demand points, and then calculated the importance of UAV to those demand points based on their flood risk prevention level. Based on this analysis, a Maximum Covering Location Problem (MCLP) model was adopted to determine the optimum stations for UAV airports and a costeffectiveness curve was used to determine the optimum number of UAV airports. In the end, 81 field stations were selected from 268 field stations, thereby ensuring that UAV airports would be allocated near flood-prone areas and most floods in China could be monitored with UAVs within two hours, which is critical for saving lives and reducing losses. The construction of UAV airport networks will surely contribute to an integrated disaster emergency observation system combining satellite, airplane, UAV and ground observations in China. Additionally, the methods and results in this study can serve as a basis for building a more comprehensive national UAV remote sensing observation network. © 2019, Science Press.

It is, however, mainly focused on certain specific classes such as cars, bicyclists and pedestrians. This work investigates traffic cones, an object category crucial for traffic control in the context of autonomous vehicles. 3D object detection using images from a monocular camera is intrinsically an ill-posed problem. In this work, we exploit the unique structure of traffic cones and propose a pipelined approach to solve this problem. Specifically, we first detect cones in images by a modified 2D object detector. Following which the keypoints on a traffic cone are recognized with the help of our deep structural regression network, here, the fact that the cross-ratio is projection invariant is leveraged for network regularization. Finally, the 3D position of cones is recovered via the classical Perspective n-Point algorithm using correspondences obtained from the keypoint regression. Extensive experiments show that our approach can accurately detect traffic cones and estimate their position in the 3D world in real time. The proposed method is also deployed on a real-time, autonomous system. It runs efficiently on the low-power Jetson TX2, providing accurate 3D position estimates, allowing a race-car to map and drive autonomously on an unseen track indicated by traffic cones.

It is still a challenging task because traditional discriminative features in high-resolution (HR) usually disappear in low-resolution (LR) images. Although recent advances in single image super-resolution (SISR) and object detection algorithms have offered unprecedented potential for computer-automated reconstructing LR images and detecting various objects, these algorithms are mainly evaluated using synthetic datasets. It is unclear how these algorithms would perform on bird images acquired in the wild and how we could gauge the progress in the real-time bird detection. This paper presents a novel bird detection framework in LR aerial images using deep neural networks (DNN). We collect a dataset named BIRD-50 and a public dataset named CUB-200 of real bird images with different scale low-resolutions. Using these datasets, we introduce a novel DNN based framework for bird detection in reconstructed HR images, which exploits the mapping function from LR to HR aerial image and detects the birds by the state-of-the-art object feature extraction and localization methods. By systematically analyzing the influence of the resolution reduction on the bird detection, the experimental results indicate that our approach has produced significantly improved detection precision for bird detection by the inclusion of SISR algorithms. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This work resulted in a nonlinear model predictive control based algorithm that simultaneously optimises both the speed and steering commands. The algorithm can exploit the dynamic limits of the vehicle to navigate it to a target position as quickly as possible without compromising safety. In the algorithm, a model of the vehicle is used explicitly to predict and optimise future actions, but in practice the model parameter values are not known exactly. Thus, in this paper, the robustness of the algorithm to parametric uncertainty is evaluated. It is first demonstrated that using nominal parameter values in the algorithm leads to safety issues in 24% of the evaluated scenarios with the considered parametric uncertainty distributions. To improve the algorithm's robustness, a novel double-worst-case formulation is developed that simultaneously accounts for the robust satisfaction of the two safety requirements of high-speed obstacle avoidance: collision-free and no-wheel-lift-off. Results from simulations with stratified random scenarios and worst-case scenarios show that the double-worst-case formulation renders the algorithm robust to all uncertainty realisations tested. The trade-off between robustness and the task completion performance is also quantified. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This paper intersects two unique fields-deep learning and critical infrastructure protection-and illustrates how deep learning can improve resiliency within the electricity sector. Machine vision is the combination of machine intelligence, or computer systems automatically learning patterns from exemplar data, and image analysis, or objects of interest being automatically segmented and identified from video image data. This technology has the potential to automate threat assessments in the context of securing critical infrastructures. Rather than traditional reactionary approaches, we present here a method of leveraging deep learning for the detection of threats to critical infrastructures before failures occur. This paper discusses the state-of-the-art in deep learning for creating machine vision systems, and the concepts are applied to increase the resiliency of critical infrastructures. The intersection between machine vision and critical infrastructures is discussed, as are key benefits and challenges of invoking such an approach, and examples within several fields of critical infrastructures are presented.

With the new era of the Sentinel missions, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and multispectral data are now freely available and repeatedly acquired on a high spatial and temporal resolution for the entire globe. However, the high potential of such sensors for automatic mapping procedures cannot be fully harnessed without sufficient and appropriate reference data for model calibration. Reference data are commonly acquired in field surveys, which however, are often relatively expensive and affected by sampling and observer bias. Moreover, a direct transferability to the remote sensing perspective and scale is difficult. Accordingly, we firstly assess the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for semi-automatic reference data acquisition on species cover of three woody invasive species Pinus radiata, Ulex europaeus and Acacia dealbata occurring in Chile. Secondly, we test the upscaling of the estimated species cover to the spatial scale of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. The proposed workflow includes the visual sampling of respective canopies in UAV orthomosaics and the subsequent spatial extrapolations using MaxEnt with spectral (RGB, Hyperspectral), textural (2D) and canopy structural (3D) predictors derived from UAV-based photogrammetry. These UAV-based maps are then used to train random forest models with multitemporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to map the invasive species cover on large spatial scales. Our results show that the semi-automatic UAV-based mapping of the three invasive species results in accurate predictions. Depending on the predictor combination, the correlation was 0.70, 0.77 and 0.90 for Pinus radiatia, Ulex europaeus, Acacia dealbata, respectively. Among the three species, we observed clear differences in the model performance between the tested photogrammetric predictors and their combinations (spectral, 2D texture or 3D structure). For scaling up the UAV-based estimates to the satellite-scale, the Sentinel-2 data (multispectral) were more important than Sentinel-1 data (SAR). An independent validation revealed that the R2 of the upscaling accounted for 0.78 or higher for all species and RMSE lower than 12%. Our results hence demonstrate that UAV-based reference data acquisitions are a promising alternative to traditional field surveys if the target species are directly identifiable in the UAV data. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"Design and evaluation of sensor housing for boundary layer profiling using multirotors","2019","Sensors (Switzerland)","10.3390/s19112481","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066923815&doi=10.3390%2fs19112481&partnerID=40&md5=767f3c604a2d2d716501f9e67964f29f","Traditional configurations for mounting Temperature–Humidity (TH) sensors on multirotor Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) often suffer from insufficient radiation shielding, exposure to mixed and turbulent air from propellers, and inconsistent aspiration while situated in the wake of the UAS. Descent profiles using traditional methods are unreliable (when compared to an ascent profile) due to the turbulent mixing of air by the UAS while descending into that flow field. Consequently, atmospheric boundary layer profiles that rely on such configurations are bias-prone and unreliable in certain flight patterns (such as descent). This article describes and evaluates a novel sensor housing designed to shield airborne sensors from artificial heat sources and artificial wet-bulbing while pulling air from outside the rotor wash influence. The housing is mounted above the propellers to exploit the rotor-induced pressure deficits that passively induce a high-speed laminar airflow to aspirate the sensor consistently. Our design is modular, accommodates a variety of other sensors, and would be compatible with a wide range of commercially available multirotors. Extensive flight tests conducted at altitudes up to 500 m Above Ground Level (AGL) show that the housing facilitates reliable measurements of the boundary layer phenomena and is invariant in orientation to the ambient wind, even at high vertical/horizontal speeds (up to 5 m/s) for the UAS. A low standard deviation of errors shows a good agreement between the ascent and descent profiles and proves our unique design is reliable for various UAS missions. © 2019 by the authors.

Lane-level accuracy is not readily available from low-cost global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers because of factors such as multipath error and atmospheric bias. Approaches such as differential GNSS can improve localization accuracy, but usually require investment in expensive base stations. Connected vehicle technologies provide an alternative approach in improving the localization accuracy. It will be shown in this paper that localization accuracy can be enhanced using crude GNSS measurements from a group of connected vehicles, by matching their locations to a digital map. A Rao-Blackwellized particle filter is used to jointly estimate the common biases of the pseudo-ranges and the vehicle positions. Multipath biases, which introduce receiver-specific (non-common) error, are mitigated by a multi-hypothesis detection-rejection approach. The temporal correlation of the estimations is exploited through the prediction-update process. The proposed approach is compared with existing methods using both simulations and experimental results. It was found that the proposed algorithm can eliminate the common biases and reduce the localization error to below 1 m under open sky conditions. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, these techniques are data-driven, delegating the accuracy to the training dataset which must resemble the images in the target task. The acquisition of a dataset involves annotating images, an arduous and expensive process, generally requiring time and manual effort. Thus, a challenging scenario arises when the target domain of application has no annotated dataset available, making tasks in such situation to lean on a training dataset of a different domain. Sharing this issue, object detection is a vital task for autonomous vehicles where the large amount of driving scenarios yields several domains of application requiring annotated data for the training process. In this work, a method for training a car detection system with annotated data from a source domain (day images) without requiring the image annotations of the target domain (night images) is presented. For that, a model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is explored to enable the generation of an artificial dataset with its respective annotations. The artificial dataset (fake dataset) is created translating images from day-time domain to night-time domain. The fake dataset, which comprises annotated images of only the target domain (night images), is then used to train the car detector model. Experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved significant and consistent improvements, including the increasing by more than 10% of the detection performance when compared to the training with only the available annotated data (i.e., day images). © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Actually, the requirement to detect the suitable clustering solution without need for user-given parameters still remain challenging in unsupervised learning. This paper proposes an efficient and effective clustering method, named AF-DBSCAN (Automatic Fuzzy DBSCAN) based on the fuzzy clustering method FN-DBSCAN (Fuzzy Neighborhood Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise). The main idea of the proposed method is to cover the limitations of FN-DBSCAN by exploiting the benefits of k-neighbors plot, in purpose to determine the input parameter values. In fact, AF-DBSCAN avoids the manual intervention of non-experimental users in estimating the input parameters, the minimal threshold of neighborhood membership degree 1 and the minimal neighborhood set cardinality 2, which are hard to guess, and so permits to determine them more reasonably. In such way, the whole clustering process can be fully automated. Simulation experiments, carried out on a real medical data set, highlighted the AF-DBSCAN's effectiveness even for high-dimensions data sets, and showed that the proposed method outperformed the classical method since it provides a better clustering accuracy. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This research targets to optimizing an airfoil by changing the parameters such as maximum thickness, camber, camber location, the angle of attack, and the wing taper ratio in order to minimize the turn radius of a small unmanned aerial vehicle at low Reynolds numbers. Firstly, the base airfoil, which is NACA4412, is generated by using MATLAB [1] and it is analyzed in XFOIL. Then, the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil are evaluated thanks to MATLAB-XFOIL interface. Eventually, the airfoil is optimized by using MATLAB fmincon solvers, which are Sequential Quadratic Programming and Interior-Point Methods. The results-coming from solvers- are compared. During the iterative process, the lift coefficient and the moment coefficient of the airfoil are kept constant.

We consider phonocardiogram (PCG) or heart sound as the exemplary physiological signal. PCG carries substantial cardiac health signature to establish our claim of data-centric superior clinical utility. Our method demonstrates close to 85% accuracy on publicly available MIT-Physionet PCG datasets and outperform relevant state-of-the-art algorithm.

The increasing availability of high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) point clouds derived from low-cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and modern photogrammetry offers an opportunity to generate a Canopy Height Model (CHM) in the mountainous areas. In this paper, we assessed the capabilities of tree height estimation using UAV-based Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry and Semi-Global Matching (SGM). The former is utilized to generate 3D geometry, while the latter is used to generate dense point clouds from UAV imagery. The two algorithms were coupled with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network to acquire CHMs in mountainous areas. This study focused on the performance of Digital Terrain Model (DTM) interpolation over complex terrains. With the UAV-based image acquisition and image-derived point clouds, we constructed a 5 cm-resolution Digital Surface Model (DSM), which was assessed against 14 independent checkpoints measured by a Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System RTK GPS. Results showed that the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) of horizontal and vertical accuracies are approximately 5 cm and 10 cm, respectively. Bare-earth Index (BEI) and Shadow Index (SI) were used to separate ground points from the image-derived point clouds. The RBF neural network coupled with the Difference of Gaussian (DoG) was exploited to provide a favorable generalization for the DTM from 3D ground points with noisy data. CHMs were generated using the height value in each pixel of the DSM and by subtracting the corresponding DTM value. Individual tree heights were estimated using local maxima algorithm under a contour-surround constraint. Two forest plantations in mountainous areas were selected to evaluate the accuracy of estimating tree heights, rather than field measurements. Results indicated that the proposed method can construct a highly accurate DTM and effectively remove nontreetop maxima. Furthermore, the proposed method has been confirmed to be acceptable for tree height estimation in mountainous areas given the strong linear correlation of the measured and estimated tree heights and the acceptable t-test values. Overall, the low-cost UAV-based photogrammetry and RBF neural network can yield a highly accurate DTM over mountainous terrain, thereby making them particularly suitable for rapid and cost-effective estimation of tree heights of forest plantation in mountainous areas. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Therefore, it is necessary to carry out research on the buffering technology of the impact load of the vehicle into the water to ensure that the AUV can enter the water safely and reliably. In this paper, a mitigator is designed to reduce the impact load of the AUV entering the water. Numerical simulations based on the explicit finite element method with an Arbitrary-Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE)solver are carried out to study the mitigation characteristic of the designed mitigator. The accuracy of the model was verified by the experimental results of the water-entry of the small sphere, and the mesh independence was verified to determine the mesh size. Then, the effects of initial conditions such as buffer length, buffer material density, entry velocity and entry angle on the cushioning effect of the buffer head cap were studied. When the vertical water entry velocity is 50 m/s, the impact load reduction ratio is 42.2%; while the water entry angle is 60° and the water entry velocity is 50 m/s, the axial load reduction ratio is 28.8%, and the normal load reduction ratio is 27.8%. These conclusions will be useful for the designing of the crashworthy structural and the analysis of underwater weapon impact. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

Although different, the synergy between these two data sources has motivated exploration of the potential for combining data in various applications, especially for classification and extraction of information in urban environments. Despite the efforts of the scientific community, integrating LiDAR data and images remains a challenging task. For this reason, the development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) along with the integration and synchronization of positioning receivers, inertial systems and off-the-shelf imaging sensors has enabled the exploitation of the high-density photogrammetric point cloud (PPC) as an alternative, obviating the need to integrate LiDAR and optical images. This study therefore aims to compare the results of PPC classification in urban scenes considering radiometric-only, geometric-only and combined radiometric and geometric data applied to the Random Forest algorithm. For this study the following classes were considered: buildings, asphalt, trees, grass, bare soil, sidewalks and power lines, which encompass the most common objects in urban scenes. The classification procedure was performed considering radiometric features (Green band, Red band, NIR band, NDVI and Saturation) and geometric features (Height-nDSM, Linearity, Planarity, Scatter, Anisotropy, Omnivariance and Eigenentropy). The quantitative analyses were performed by means of the classification error matrix using the following metrics: overall accuracy, recall and precision.

The ACC vehicles detect front vehicle' information via vehicle-mounted sensors and make longitudinal reactions automatically, while CACC vehicles enhance the performance by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wireless communication. However, CACC vehicles may abruptly degrade to ACC mode in reality due to various reasons, including communication failures, driver manipulations, and cyber-attacks. The sudden degradation will definitely bring negative influences on safety. Method:This study quantitatively evaluated the longitudinal safety impacts of vehicles' degradation in a CACC fleet based on microscopic simulations. The realistic CACC and ACC models proposed by the California Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways (PATH) were used for simulation experiments. The time integrated time-to-collision (TIT) was measured to quantify the collision risks. Extensive simulations were conducted via a fleet of 10 CACC vehicles and speed profiles of vehicles in different scenarios were compared. Key factors, including the leading vehicle's deceleration rate, the number of vehicles between degraded vehicles (NVDVs), threshold of TTC, and visibility were also examined via sensitivity analyses. Results and conclusions: Simulation results indicate that degradation has significant negative influences on longitudinal safety of degraded vehicles under the driving state of deceleration. Degradation at middle positions in a CACC fleet, such as fourth and fifth positions, is much safer than that at others. Moreover, nonadjacent degradation is much riskier than adjacent degradation at the front positions of a fleet. NVDVs can bring inverse impacts on safety with different degradation positions. Speed profiles imply that the hysteresis of degraded vehicles' speed control is the major reason for high collision risks. Practical applications: Appropriately, hierarchical countermeasures have the potential to reduce the longitudinal safety impacts of degradation. Findings of this study can contribute to determining the applicable length of CACC fleets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and National Safety Council","Article","Final","Scopus"

Considering that the diving motion of UAAV plays an important role in the performance of UAAV and is under exploration, the dynamics modeling and trajectory optimization problem are studied in this paper. The UAAV model used in this study is introduced firstly, and folded wings are adopted to reduce the drag in the diving process. Among the forces imposed on UAAV, fluid force is the most complicated and is calculated by the forces induced by ideal fluid and viscous fluid respectively. Based on the established dynamic model, the diving process is regarded as a free motion to avoid the instability during the control switch between air and water. Therefore, the trajectory of UAAV is determined by the initial states of diving process. To obtain the satisfactory trajectory under certain optimization index, an adaptive and global-best guided CS algorithm, named as improved cuckoo search (ICS) algorithm, is developed to strength the exploitation ability and search efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the established dynamical model of UAAV is rational and can reflect the characteristic of the diving motion. The proposed ICS algorithm performs better than the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the standard CS algorithm both in optimizing the elapsed time of diving process and the terminal position error. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Article","Final","Scopus"

Because cloud services are vulnerable to advanced persistent threats (APTs), each device in the IoCT must strategically decide whether to trust cloud services that may be compromised. In this paper, we present iSTRICT, an interdependent strategic trust mechanism for the cloud-enabled IoCT. iSTRICT is composed of three interdependent layers. In the cloud layer, iSTRICT uses FlipIt games to conceptualize APTs. In the communication layer, it captures the interaction between devices and the cloud using signaling games. In the physical layer, iSTRICT uses optimal control to quantify the utilities in the higher level games. Best response dynamics link the three layers in an overall ""game-of-games,"" for which the outcome is captured by a concept called Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE). We prove the existence of a GNE under a set of natural assumptions and develop an adaptive algorithm to iteratively compute the equilibrium. Finally, we apply iSTRICT to trust management for autonomous vehicles that rely on measurements from remote sources. We show that strategic trust in the communication layer achieves a worst-case probability of compromise for any attack and defense costs in the cyber layer. © 2018 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

With the rise in data use have come concerns about automotive cyber-security. An in-vehicle network shown to be particularly vulnerable is the Controller Area Network (CAN), which is the communication bus used by the car's safety critical and performance critical components. Cyber attacks on the CAN have been demonstrated, leading to research to develop attack detection and attack prevention systems. Such research requires representative attack demonstrations and data for testing. Obtaining this data is problematical due to the expense, danger and impracticality of using real cars on roads or tracks for example attacks. Whilst CAN simulators are available, these tend to be configured for testing conformance and functionality, rather than analysing security and cyber vulnerability. We therefore adapt a leading, industry-standard, CAN simulator to incorporate a core set of cyber attacks that are representative of those proposed by other researchers. Our adaptation allows the user to configure the attacks, and can be added easily to the free version of the simulator. Here we describe the simulator and, after reviewing the attacks that have been demonstrated and discussing their commonalities, we outline the attacks that we have incorporated into the simulator. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Earlier researchers assume that the owner of the object needs to either be online and actively participating for an update of travel status of a moving object, or rely on a third party to perform this task. If no such third party exists and owner is offline for a certain period, this leads to an inconsistent travel status. On the contrary, involvement of the third party in the update process requires it to be fully trusted, which can lead to privacy threats to the owner. Therefore, the existing works depend either on the unreliable owner device or on the vulnerable third party. This paper performs cryptanalysis on the object tracking protocol proposed by Ray et al. and discovers that this protocol does not allow the owner device to be offline, and it has various security issues. Along with this cryptanalysis, this paper proposes an IoT based object tracking system that depends only on the third party and allows the owner device to be offline. However, the vulnerabilities of this third party have been taken care in such a way that there is no privacy risk for the owner.

Autonomous intersection management (AIM) is tailored for CAVs aiming at replacing the conventional traffic control strategies. In this work, using the communication and computation technologies of CAVs, the sequential movements of vehicles through intersections are modelled as multi-agent Markov decision processes (MAMDPs) in which vehicle agents cooperate to minimize intersection delay with collision-free constraints. To handle the huge dimension scale incurred by the nature of multi-agent decision making problems, the state space of CAVs are decomposed into independent part and coordinated part by exploiting the structural properties of the AIM problem, and a decentralized coordination multi-agent learning approach (DCL-AIM) is proposed to solve the problem efficiently by exploiting both global and localized agent coordination needs in AIM. The main feature of the proposed approach is to explicitly identify and dynamically adapt agent coordination needs during the learning process so that the curse of dimensionality and environment nonstationarity problems in multi-agent learning can be alleviated. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated under a variety of traffic conditions. The comparison analysis is performed between DCL-AIM and the First-Come-First-Serve based AIM (FCFS-AIM), with Longest-Queue-First (LQF-AIM) policy and the signal control based on the Webster's method (Signal) as benchmarks.

The aftermath of such attacks is felt until today, as numerous unexploded bombs or duds still exist in the ground. Typically, such areas are documented in so-called impact maps, which are based on detected bomb craters. This paper proposes a stochastic approach to automatically detect bomb craters in aerial wartime images that were taken during World War II. In this work, one aspect we investigate is the type of object model for the crater: we compare circles with ellipses. The respective models are embedded in the probabilistic framework of marked point processes. By means of stochastic sampling the most likely configuration of objects within the scene is determined. Each configuration is evaluated using an energy function which describes the conformity with a predefined model. High gradient magnitudes along the border of the object are favoured and overlapping objects are penalized. In addition, a term that requires the grey values inside the object to be homogeneous is investigated. Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling in combination with simulated annealing provides the global optimum of the energy function. Afterwards, a probability map is generated from the automatic detections via kernel density estimation. By setting a threshold, areas around the detections are classified as contaminated or uncontaminated sites, respectively, which results in an impact map. Our results, based on 22 aerial wartime images, show the general potential of the method for the automated detection of bomb craters and the subsequent automatic generation of an impact map. © Authors 2019.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The engineering of this class of devices and the evaluation of their performances require the measurement of the porosity and surface area of the active carbon layers. The quantitative characterization of these parameters by gas adsorption techniques is hampered by the small amount of material usually available on a thin film. Here we report a method based on the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and nitrogen adsorption technique for the quantitative characterization of the specific surface area and porosity of nanoporous carbon films. In particular, we apply it to nanostructured carbon films fabricated by supersonic cluster beam deposition (SCBD), studying the evolution of their structural properties with film thickness. We exploited the characteristics of SCBD in terms of high-throughput, stability, and reproducibility to fabricate films with controlled nano and microstructure over large substrates compatible with the requirements of gas adsorption measurements.

To carry out static analyses in order to determine the worst-case execution time or the worst-case energy consumption of tasks, cost models are inevitable. However, these models are rarely available on a fine-grained level for commercial-off-the-shelf hardware platforms. In this letter, we present NEO, an end-to-end toolchain that automatically generates cost models, which are then integrated into an existing static-analysis tool. NEO exploits automatically generated benchmark programs, which are measured on the target platform and investigated in a virtual machine. Based on the gathered data, we formulate mathematical optimization problems that eventually yield both worst-case execution-time and energy-consumption cost models. In our evaluations with an embedded hardware platform (e.g., ARM Cortex-M0+), we show that the open-source toolchain is able to precisely bound programs' resources while achieving acceptable accuracy. © 2018 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, this is not as simple as instantaneously closing down all fossil fuel energy generation and replacing them with renewable sources - careful decisions need to be taken to ensure rapid but stable progress. To aid decision makers, we present a new tool, ElecSim, which is an open-sourced agent-based modelling framework used to examine the effect of policy on long-term investment decisions in electricity generation. ElecSim allows non-experts to rapidly prototype new ideas. Different techniques to model long-term electricity decisions are reviewed and used to motivate why agent-based models will become an important strategic tool for policy. We motivate why an open-source toolkit is required for long-term electricity planning. Actual electricity prices are compared with our model and we demonstrate that the use of a Monte-Carlo simulation in the system improves performance by 52:5%. Further, using ElecSim we demonstrate the effect of a carbon tax to encourage a low-carbon electricity supply. We show how a £40 ($50) per tonne of CO2 emitted would lead to 70% renewable electricity by 2050. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This paper addresses the problem of cooperative flight path planning where the air vehicles should arrive at the destinations simultaneously or sequentially with specified time delays, while minimizing the total mission time. This involves finding an optimal assignment of air vehicles to targets and generating trajectories in compliance with the kinematic constraints of the vehicles. The trajectories have to avoid nofly-areas, threats and other obstacles, and must prevent the air vehicles from colliding with each other. The presented algorithm for simultaneous arrival first calculates shortest flight paths between all pairs of air vehicles and targets using a network-based routing model. An optimal assignment and a critical path is found by solving a linear bottleneck assignment problem with costs corresponding to the lengths of the shortest paths. The other flight paths are prolongated to the length of the critical path by automatic insertion of waypoints. This is achieved by concatenating subpaths stored in different shortest-path-trees. Due to the special structure of the network, all concatenated flight paths are flyable and feasible. Sequential arrival at a target is realized by sorting the flight paths according to their lengths and prolongating them whenever necessary to accomplish the desired time delays. The capability of the approach is demonstrated by simulation results. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Recently introduced percutaneous LAA occlusion procedure is known to reduce LAA-induced strokes. Despite having the procedure, there are still 11% of the patients who continue to suffer from future strokes or transient ischemic attacks, not accounting for the procedural related complications. The high failure rate is largely due to the variabilities in LAA’s shape, size, and contractility which may result in ineffectiveness of this procedure. To correctly identify the candidates and evaluate the effectiveness of the procedure, we rely on patient-specific CT scans which provides the exact LA and LAA geometries and predictive hemodynamic analysis to assist in evaluating quantitative flow parameters pre- and post-LAA occlusion procedures. Hemodynamic parameters are critical to predict adverse hemodynamic flow patterns in LAA as well as the effectiveness of LAA closure in individual patient. The aim of this paper is to establish an image-based patient-specific computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation framework specific to the prediction of treatment outcomes of LAA closure with atrial fibrillation. This framework utilizes automated LA/LAA image segmentation which yields significant reduction in image processing. One set of patient data with successful procedure outcome is used to illustrate the potential of the proposed framework. Methods: The proposed LAA occlusion simulation framework is composed of several components: (1) a novel image segmentation procedure, which is fully-automated to identify LA/LAA geometries from CT images, (2) a finite-element mesh generation procedure which transforms the surface geometry into a 3-D volume mesh and properly identified boundary planes, (3) performing CFD simulations with atrial fibrillation flow boundary conditions, and (4) analyzing flow characteristics (velocity, flow patterns, streamlines, vortices) within the LA for before and after LAA closure. Results: Based on the LA/LAA segmentation of a 65 year old female patient with chronic atrial fibrillation, a CFD analysis was pursued to examine flow characteristics upon LAA closure. The results showed that the flow velocity magnitudes were significantly reduced by a maximum factor of 2.21, flow streamlines were greatly stabilized, and mitral outflow appeared to be more organized. Vortices were dramatically reduced in size, number, intensity, as well as duration. During diastole, the peak vortex diameter was reduced from 2.8 to 1.5 cm, while the vortex duration was reduced from 0.210 to 0.135 s. These flow characteristics all indicated a reduced risk in future thrombus formation and strokes based on the established relationship between flow and thrombus formation. For the patient case under study, the effectiveness of the procedure is predicted and found to be consistent with the actual procedural outcome. Conclusions: This framework successfully predicted patient-specific outcome of a LAA closure procedure for one patient with atrial fibrillation. It can be further developed into a useful tool for pre-procedural planning and candidate selection. More patient data are necessary for further validation studies. © 2019, Biomedical Engineering Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Assuming the attacker adopts the augmented proportional navigation law and there is one-way information transportation between the defender and the target, the nonlinear model describing the changing of the line of sight between the defender and the attacker is derived. With the consideration of the requirement of the defender's miss distance, the constraint of defender's terminal intercept angle and the control energy of the defender (or target), the performance index is established. The one-way cooperative guidance law of the target and that of the defender, which can make the defender intercept the attacker with the designated intercept angle successfully, are deduced based on optimal control theory. Simulation results show that the defender can intercept the attacker with a designated intercept angle through the cooperative flight with the target under two kinds of one-way information transmission. The control energy under the one-way cooperative guidance law of the defender is less compared with that under the non-cooperation guidance law. © 2019, Editorial Office of Systems Engineering and Electronics.

In this study, we developed titanium carbide-poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) heterostructures by electrochemical deposition using a non-aqueous monomeric electrolytic bath. Planar electrodes of such hybrid films were carved directly using an automated scalpel technique. Hybrid microsupercapacitors showed five-fold areal capacitance and higher rate capabilities (2.4 mF cm−2 at 10 mV s−1, retaining 1.4 mF cm−2 at 1000 mV s−1) over the pristine MXene microsupercapacitors (455 μF cm−2 at 10 mV s−1, 120 μF cm−2 at 1000 mV s−1). Furthermore, the electrochromic behavior of PEDOT/Ti3C2Tx microsupercapacitors was investigated using in-situ UV–vis and resonant Raman spectroscopies. A high-rate color switch between a deep blue and colorless state is achieved on both electrodes in the voltage range of −0.6 to 0.6 V, with switching times of 6.4 and 5.5 s for bleaching and coloration, respectively.

This network architecture considers vehicles as nodes and information as packets for communication. Vehicles create an autonomous network with assistance of RSU (Road Side Units). This technology supports real time alert systems to broadcast emergency messages to the police, ambulance and drivers of the vehicles in some unexpected situations like traffic emergency, accident, road conditions, vehicle tracking, whether conditions and message monitoring. Since these nodes operate in a physically insecure environment in the range of 100 to 300 meters circumference. Security is a challenging issue for the technology to provide secured prominent approach for routing. Like other networks VANET network is also prone to various attacks. Timing and DoS is done by capturing the messages in VANET and replaying them at later point of time in bulk, such that RSU and vehicle resources are wasted in processing those messages. We need to have a technology by virtue of which network nodes (vehicles) should be smart enough to manage road safety at their own. In this paper RSU assisted DoS attack detection and prevention technique is proposed for VANET.

If one looks at the role they play today, it is hard to deny that their impact has increased beyond anything the drafters of the 1948 Universal Declaration could have hoped or imagined. However, even though human rights today have a far greater impact on politics than in the past, the philosophical reflection that surrounds them has had a less fortunate history. It is doubtful whether we are today in a better position than we were in 1948 to answer any of the philosophical questions surrounding them, including, and perhaps most crucially, the question about their foundation. Why are human rights standards-of whatever sort-that we should adopt, or even just take seriously? The first two parts of this paper summarize my recent work on the above question (Caranti, 2017) and the third takes it a step further. I will 1) show why the main orientations in the contemporary philosophy of human rights all fail to yield a satisfactory foundation, 2) sketch an alternative foundation that exploits Kant's account of human dignity in a rather critical way; and 3) address one major objection my approach is bound to attract (and in a certain form has already attracted). Since my foundation suggests that we have dignity (and as a consequence human rights) because we are autonomous, that is, capable of moral behavior, some scholars have argued that I am bound to the counterintuitive conclusion that people with a temporary or permanent lack of rational capacity, which would cause a condition of ""impaired autonomy,"" are not entitled to the protection of human rights. While this objection does nothing but reformulate in the language of human rights an old, classical objection to Kant's ethics, replying to it requires mobilizing new intellectual resources. © 2019 Institute for Research in Social Communication, Slovak Academy of Sciences 2019.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Smart vehicles have played a significant role in the advancement of intelligent and connected transportation systems. Continuous vehicular cloud service availability in smart cities is becoming a crucial subscriber necessity which requires improvement in the vehicular service management architecture. Moreover, as smart cities continue to deploy diversified technologies to achieve assorted and high-performance cloud services, security issues with regards to communicating entities which share personal requester information still prevails. To mitigate these concerns, we introduce an automated secure continuous cloud service availability framework for smart connected vehicles that enables an intrusion detection mechanism against security attacks and provides services that meet users’ quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) requirements. Continuous service availability is achieved by clustering smart vehicles into service-specific clusters. Cluster heads are selected for communication purposes with trusted third-party entities (TTPs) acting as mediators between service requesters and providers. The most optimal services are then delivered from the selected service providers to the requesters. Furthermore, intrusion detection is accomplished through a three-phase data traffic analysis, reduction, and classification technique used to identify positive trusted service requests against false requests that may occur during intrusion attacks. The solution adopts deep belief and decision tree machine learning mechanisms used for data reduction and classification purposes, respectively. The framework is validated through simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution in terms of intrusion attack detection. The proposed solution achieved an overall accuracy of 99.43% with 99.92% detection rate and 0.96% false positive and false negative rate of 1.53%. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Unfortunately, traditional verification methods do not scale to the complexity of these systems and do not provide systematic methods to protect verified properties when not all the components can be verified. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a real-time mixed-trust computing framework that combines verification and protection. The framework introduces a new task model, where an application task can have both an untrusted and a trusted part. The untrusted part allows complex computations supported by a full OS with a realtime scheduler running in a VM hosted by a trusted hypervisor. The trusted part is executed by another scheduler within the hypervisor and is thus protected from the untrusted part. If the untrusted part fails to finish by a specific time, the trusted part is activated to preserve safety (e.g., prevent a crash) including its timing guarantees. This framework is the first allowing the use of untrusted components for CPS critical functions while preserving logical and timing guarantees, even in the presence of malicious attackers. We present the framework design and implementation along with the schedulability analysis and the coordination protocol between the trusted and untrusted parts. We also present our Raspberry Pi 3 implementation along with experiments showing the behavior of the system under failures of untrusted components, and a drone application to demonstrate its practicality. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Mobility focuses on ground vehicles' capabilities that enable them to be deployable worldwide, operationally mobile in all environments, and protected from symmetrical and asymmetrical threats. In order for military ground vehicles to operate in any combat zone, mobility on off-road terrains should be extensively investigated. Mobility on off-road terrains is poorly understood because of the empirical and semi-empirical height-field based methods which are often used for predicting vehicle mobility, such as Bekker-Wong type models. Those methods do not capture the three-dimensional soil deformation/flow as well as the soil's nonlinear behavior. The discrete element method (DEM) in which soil is modeled using discrete particles was identified as a high-fidelity method that can capture the deformation of the soil and its nonlinear behavior. In this paper, a simulation study is undertaken to understand the influence of DEM soil model parameters on vehicle mobility. A typical wheeled vehicle model was built in IVRESS/DIS software and simulated over different cohesive and noncohesive soils modeled using DEM, with a particular emphasis on weak soils (with both low friction angle and low cohesion). Some characteristics of these soils were varied, namely, the interparticle cohesion, the interparticle friction, the particle size, and the particle mass. The mobility measures, including vehicle speed, wheel sinkage, wheel slip, and tractive force were evaluated using the model and correlated to the DEM soil model parameters. This study shows that the vehicle speed increases with cohesion, friction, soil density, and particle size while wheel sinkage, wheel slip, and tractive force decrease with those parameters. The combined influence of those parameters is more complex. Extensive studies of those and other soil parameters need to be carried out in the future to understand their effect on vehicle mobility.

Knowledge about the diffusion's direction into application fields, which have not yet completely been exploited, may help technology managers and scholars to better understand the evolution of the RFID technology. Recent methods are either characterized by high manual efforts or miss the opportunity to directly identify emerging application fields. This leads to the question, which method is suitable for examining a technology's diffusion in a time-oriented and highly automated manner. In this paper, dynamic topic modeling (DTM) is applied for this purpose. Using the same RFID patent data set as in earlier publications, we create a term-document matrix. Subsequent to this, we carry out DTM and thus retrieve relevant topics which represent application fields. Additionally, we identify dynamic shifts in the application fields. Finally, we make a comparison between DTM and topic modeling in particular. We conclude that DTM is more appropriate for measuring the diffusion of a technology into an application field than earlier methods. Apart from generating an overview of application fields, DTM enables the observation of term dynamics in the application fields, and is therefore suitable for managers and scholars interested in technology diffusion. © 2019 PICMET.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The first FAM is designed with the use of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) using subtractive clustering (referred to as ANFIS-SC) and fuzzy C-means (referred to as ANFIS-FCM). The second FAM is developed based on Type-1 fuzzy inference systems, while the third FAM exploits interval Type-2 fuzzy inference systems.

This feature can be exploited to drive an optimal velocity trajectory that minimizes fuel consumption. Two typical approaches to drive cycle optimization are velocity smoothing and tractive energy minimization. The former reduces accelerations and decelerations, and hence, it does not require information of vehicle parameters and resistance forces. On the other hand, the latter reduces tractive energy demand at the wheels of a vehicle. In this work, utilizing an experimentally validated full vehicle simulation software, we show that for conventional gasoline vehicles the lower energy velocity trajectory can consume as much fuel as the velocity smoothing case. This implies that the easily implementable, vehicle agnostic velocity smoothing optimization can be used for velocity optimization rather than the nonlinear tractive energy minimization, which results in a pulse-and-glide trajectory.

However, incidents such as fatal system failures, malicious attacks, and disastrous misuses have raised concerns in the recent past. Security and viability concerns in drone-based applications are growing at an alarming rate. Besides, UAV networks (UAVNets) are distinctive from other ad-hoc networks. Therefore, it is necessary to address these issues to ensure proper functioning of these UAVs while keeping their uniqueness in mind. Furthermore, adequate security and functionality require the consideration of many parameters that may include an accurate cognizance of the working mechanism of vehicles, geographical and weather conditions, and UAVNet communication. This is achievable by creating a simulator that includes these aspects. A performance evaluation through relevant drone simulator becomes indispensable procedure to test features, configurations, and designs to demonstrate superiority to comparative schemes and suitability. Thus, it becomes of paramount importance to establish the credibility of simulation results by investigating the merits and limitations of each simulator prior to selection.

However, these AKA protocols fail to preserve the privacy of communication entities and suffer from numerous attacks. In addition, these protocols incur high network overhead which doesn’t suit for the resource-constrained mobile devices in LTE/LTE-A network. Also, the protocols can’t establish the key forward/backward secrecy (KFS/KBS) and overcome the key escrow problem. To avoid the above-mentioned security issues, we propose the provably secure and efficient handover (PSEH)-AKA protocol based on double-trapdoor chameleon hash function. The PSEH-AKA protocol is proven secure under random oracle model to obtain the mutual authentication, session key secrecy, integrity and resistance from malicious attacks. The proposed handover protocol accommodates all the security demands such as KFS/KBS, privacy-preservation and establishes the secure session key between the communication entities. Furthermore, the formal verification using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool shows the correctness and informal analysis shows the security properties of the protocol. The performance evaluation of the PSEH-AKA protocol is carried out with existing handover AKA protocols in terms of storage, communication, and computation overhead.

Especially for driverless cars, real-time map updating can provide high-precision map service to assist the navigation, which requires vehicles to actively upload the latest road conditions. However, due to the untrusted network environment, it is difficult for the real-time map updating server to evaluate the authenticity of the road information from the vehicles. In order to prevent malicious vehicles from deliberately spreading false information and protect the privacy of vehicles from tracking attacks, this paper proposes a trust-based real-time map updating scheme. In this scheme, the public key is used as the identifier of the vehicle for anonymous communication with conditional anonymity. In addition, the blockchain is applied to provide the existence proof for the public key certificate of the vehicle. At the same time, to avoid the spread of false messages, a trust evaluation algorithm is designed. The fog node can validate the received massages from vehicles using Bayesian Inference Model. Based on the verification results, the road condition information is sent to the real-time map updating server so that the server can update the map in time and prevent the secondary traffic accident. In order to calculate the trust value offset for the vehicle, the fog node generates a rating for each message source vehicle, and finally adds the relevant data to the blockchain. According to the result of security analysis, this scheme can guarantee the anonymity and prevent the Sybil attack.

Unfortunately, the common practice to validating a deep neural network (DNN) - measuring overall accuracy on a randomly selected test set - is not designed to surface corner-case errors. As recent work shows, even DNNs with state-of-the-art accuracy are easily fooled by human-imperceptible, adversarial perturbations to the inputs. Questions such as how to test corner-case behaviors more thoroughly and whether all adversarial samples have been found remain unanswered. In the last few years, we have been working on bringing more engineering rigor into deep learning. Towards this goal, we have built five systems to test DNNs more thoroughly and verify the absence of adversarial samples for given datasets. These systems check a broad spectrum of properties (e.g., rotating an image should never change its classification) and find thousands of error-inducing samples for popular DNNs in critical domains (e.g., ImageNet, autonomous driving, and malware detection). Our DNN verifiers are also orders of magnitude (e.g., 5,000×) faster than similar tools.

The acquired images can be utilized to generate high-quality 3D models using current multi-view stereo approaches. However, the quality of the resulting 3D model highly depends on the preceding flight plan which still requires human expert knowledge, especially in complex urban and hazardous environments. In terms of safe flight plans, practical considerations often define prohibited and restricted airspaces to be accessed with the vehicle. We propose a 3D UAV path planning framework designed for detailed and complete small-scaled 3D reconstructions considering the semantic properties of the environment allowing for user-specified restrictions on the airspace. The generated trajectories account for the desired model resolution and the demands on a successful photogrammetric reconstruction. We exploit semantics from an initial flight to extract the target object and to define restricted and prohibited airspaces which have to be avoided during the path planning process to ensure a safe and short UAV path, while still aiming to maximize the object reconstruction quality. The path planning problem is formulated as an orienteering problem and solved via discrete optimization exploiting submodularity and photogrammetrical relevant heuristics. An evaluation of our method on a customized synthetic scene and on outdoor experiments suggests the real-world capability of our methodology by providing feasible, short and safe flight plans for the generation of detailed 3D reconstruction models. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, two problems need to be solved in the field of the road segmentation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images. One is the occupied proportion of road area in UAV remote sensing images; the other is that the constant size of convolutional kernel cannot deal with multiscale feature very well. To solve these two problems, this paper proposed a road segmentation model that combined the adversarial networks with multiscale context aggregation. First, the output feature-maps of three scales (0.5n, 1n, 2n) were obtained, based on an end-To-end training from image segmentation network. Second, after the convolution and deconvolution operations, the processed images were unified to the size scale of original images. Third, with the pixel-by-pixel addition method, the three scales of image feature (0.5n, 1n, 2n) were merged together, then inputted into the discriminative network. Finally, the errors were obtained and propagated backwards compared with the label, and then the parameters of a generative network and a discriminative network could be updated. Further, the segmented results were compared with those from normal adversarial networks, Linknet and D-linknet, and were developed with the morphological operation.

The model was designed in CAD software. As the UUV was symmetric about XY plane axis, so half of the UUV body was simulated. It is seen that negative lift is present for all velocity at zero angle of attack. This is a great finding of the study. This is due to conning tower which is located upon the top surface. As the angle of attack change from negative to more positive value, negative lift shifts more quickly to positive value for higher velocity. At higher velocity Lift coefficient does not change so much with velocity. Same amount to drag experience by the UUV for different diving angle. A lot of variation was found with velocity as expected, since drag is proportional to the square of velocity. CD is almost same for all diving angle for different velocity, except for lowest velocity 0.2m/s. Further investigation is needed for this large variation. From lift curve it is seen that for 0.2m/s and 0.4m/s velocity almost always creating negative lift for all diving angle. But for 0.6m/s lift was positive. A considerable difference captured in CL at 0.2m/s and 1m/s for zero diving angle. This is an important finding of the study. Other Cl are not much differing for different diving angle.

Indoor positioning of mobile units (MUs) can be provided by multilateration techniques that compute the location of an MU starting from distance measurements between the MU and a set of beacons. In this paper, a nonlinear closed-form solution for the trilateration problem is employed to avoid heavy numerical iterative algorithms.

We propose a framework to establish a radar-like information system that can track the location of any intruder drone attacking a prohibited area. It works by using a UAV tracker equipped with a calibrated 2D camera and GPS sensor. This tracker uses a camera to detect the existence of an intruder, then follow the intruder while sending the intruder's coordinate to a specific server by estimating the intruders' location using both sensors.

Firstly, the nonlinear dynamics model, kinematics model and path following error dynamics model are given. And the control objective is formulated. Then, an adaptive backstepping sliding mode controller is designed. Besides, to overcome the disadvantage of dependence on the accurate vehicle model, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDOB) is adopted to estimate the attack and sideslip angular velocities. In addition, when backstepping technique is uesd, the complex analytic computation of command derivative is required to be known. To handle this problem, a sliding mode differentiator is implemented to generate the command derivatives. Finally, the closed loop stability for the system is proved using Lyapunov stability theory.

"A General Safety Framework for Learning-Based Control in Uncertain Robotic Systems","2019","IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","10.1109/TAC.2018.2876389","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055051764&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2018.2876389&partnerID=40&md5=5311dba3556349a85f0a8109adf57aed","The proven efficacy of learning-based control schemes strongly motivates their application to robotic systems operating in the physical world. However, guaranteeing correct operation during the learning process is currently an unresolved issue, which is of vital importance in safety-critical systems. We propose a general safety framework based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability methods that can work in conjunction with an arbitrary learning algorithm. The method exploits approximate knowledge of the system dynamics to guarantee constraint satisfaction while minimally interfering with the learning process. We further introduce a Bayesian mechanism that refines the safety analysis as the system acquires new evidence, reducing initial conservativeness when appropriate while strengthening guarantees through real-Time validation. The result is a least-restrictive, safety-preserving control law that intervenes only when the computed safety guarantees require it, or confidence in the computed guarantees decays in light of new observations. We prove theoretical safety guarantees combining probabilistic and worst-case analysis and demonstrate the proposed framework experimentally on a quadrotor vehicle. Even though safety analysis is based on a simple point-mass model, the quadrotor successfully arrives at a suitable controller by policy-gradient reinforcement learning without ever crashing, and safely retracts away from a strong external disturbance introduced during flight. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"Beyond estimating discrete directions of walk: a fuzzy approach","2019","Machine Vision and Applications","10.1007/s00138-018-0939-6","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047251473&doi=10.1007%2fs00138-018-0939-6&partnerID=40&md5=b72f1b0ead2e207a88b37516c788b17d","Direction of walk of a pedestrian is vital information in various applications like visual surveillance, traffic monitoring and control, assisted living systems and automated car assistance system. Existing methods of direction of walk estimation exploit inter-frame and intra-frame features of a pedestrian frame sequence to classify the motion among predefined discrete direction classes. However, in order to achieve a robust method to estimate direction of walk, a strong analogy to justify an evident stationary or motion pattern as potential feature for direction estimation is essential. Discrete results of walk direction are famously used as it can be estimated in less time and are preferable for less precision sensitive scenario. However, the intra-frame feature that yields per-frame orientation is underutilized when the walk directions are subjected to discrete classes and hence there is a stringent need to go beyond discrete levels of direction and comment on specific walk direction angles at the same time maintaining a strong analogy to justify the potential of proposed features for direction of walk estimation. With this motivation, the article proposes a type-1 fuzzy approach over apposite inter-frame as well as intra-frame locomotion feature of pedestrian to yield precise direction of walk in terms of fuzzy directions beyond discrete levels of pedestrian walk directions. The method identifies eight directions as potential membership functions. Identified features are subjected to rule-based table for identification and removal of noisy orientation results, decision on membership function and their membership grade generation. The defuzzified result yields crisp direction of walk estimates beyond discrete levels of direction. The enhanced direction of walk estimation results is evident from qualitative comparison from existing research works and is also supported by the simulation performed over different datasets. The proposed method achieves 98.33%, 98.79%, and 100% Rank-2 balanced accuracy while applied on CASIA Dataset A, B, and NITR Conscious Walk Dataset respectively, which clearly points out its better performance than state of the art. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Disturbed microvascular blood flow is associated with excess mortality and is a potential future target for interventions. This review addresses the evidence for pharmacological manipulation of the microcirculation in sepsis assessed by techniques that evaluate the sublingual microvasculature. Methods: Systematic review using a published protocol. Eligibility criteria were studies of septic patients published from January 2000 to February 2018. Interventionswere drugs aimed at improving perfusion. Outcome was improvement in microvascular flow using orthogonal polarization spectral, sidestream dark field, or incident dark field imaging (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria used). Results: Two thousand six hundred and six articles were screened and 22 included. (6 randomized controlled trials, 12 interventional, 3 observational, and 1 pilot, n=572 participants). Multiple measurement techniques were described, including: automated analyses, subjective, and composite scoring systems. Norepinephrine was not found to improve microvascular flow (low-grade evidence, n=6 studies); except in chronic hypertension (low, n=1 study). Addition of arginine vasopressin or terlipressin to norepinephrine maintained flow while decreasing norepinephrine requirements (high, n=2 studies). Neither dobutamine nor glyceryl trinitrate consistently improved flow (low, n=6 studies). A single study (n=40 participants) demonstrated improved flow with levosimendan (high). In a risk of bias assessment 16/16 interventional, pilot and observational studies were found to be high risk. Conclusions: There is no robust evidence to date that any one agent can reproducibly lead to improved microvascular flow. Furthermore, no study demonstrated outcome benefit of one therapeutic agent over another. Updated consensus guidelines could improve comparable reporting of measurements and reduce bias, to enable meaningful comparisons around the effects of individual pharmacological agents.

This paper presents a novel flow estimation approach that assimilates distributed pressure measurements through coalescing recursive Bayesian estimation and flow model reduction using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The proposed flow estimation approach does not rely on any analytical flow model and is thus applicable to many and various complicated flow fields for arbitrarily shaped underwater robots, while most of the existing flow estimation methods apply only to those well-structured flow fields with simple robot geometry. This paper also analyzes and discusses the flow estimation design in terms of reduced-order model accuracy, relationship with conventional flow parameters, and distributed senor placement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed flow estimation approach, two simulation studies, one with a circular-shaped robot and one with a Joukowski-foil-shaped robot, are presented. The application of flow estimation in closed-loop angle-of-attack regulation is also investigated through simulation. Copyright © 2019 by ASME.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Although no single, or even a combination of biomarkers has been validated for the diagnosis of sepsis, multiple studies have shown the high specificity of CD64 expression on neutrophils (nCD64) to sepsis. The analysis of elevated nCD64 in the first 2-6 hours after infection during the pro-inflammatory stage could significantly contribute to early sepsis diagnosis. Therefore, a rapid and automated device to periodically measure nCD64 expression at the point-of-care (POC) could lead to timely medical intervention and reduced mortality rates. Current accepted technologies for measuring nCD64 expression, such as flow cytometry, require manual sample preparation and long incubation times. For POC applications, however, the technology should be able to measure nCD64 expression with little to no sample preparation. In this paper, we demonstrate a smartphone-imaged microfluidic biochip for detecting nCD64 expression in under 50 min. In our assay, first unprocessed whole blood is injected into a capture chamber to immunologically capture nCD64 along a staggered array of pillars, which were previously functionalized with an antibody against CD64. Then, an image of the capture channel is taken using a smartphone-based microscope. This image is used to measure the cumulative fraction of captured cells (γ) as a function of length in the channel. During the image analysis, a statistical model is fitted to γ in order to extract the probability of capture of neutrophils per collision with a pillar (ϵ). The fitting shows a strong correlation with nCD64 expression measured using flow cytometry (R2 = 0.82). Finally, the applicability of the device to sepsis was demonstrated by analyzing nCD64 from 8 patients (37 blood samples analyzed) along the time they were admitted to the hospital. Results from this analysis, obtained using the smartphone-imaged microfluidic biochip were compared with flow cytometry. Again, a correlation coefficient R2 = 0.82 (slope = 0.99) was obtained demonstrating a good linear correlation between the two techniques. Deployment of this technology in ICU could significantly enhance patient care worldwide. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The dynamic flow field of the ducted coaxial propeller UAV was numerically simulated. The influences of the factors such as duct, flight velocity, propeller speed and angle of attack on the unsteady aerodynamic characteristics of the ducted coaxial propeller UAV were analyzed. The calculation results show that the established CFD numerical method is suitable for simulating the dynamic flow field of ducted coaxial propeller UAV. The existence of duct significantly weakens the tip vortex, trailing edge vortex, propeller wake contraction, blade-vortex interaction and vortex-vortex interaction, and reduces the required power of the ducted coaxial propeller UAV. The lift and drag of the ducted coaxial propeller UAV increase as the forward velocity increases. The lift of the ducted coaxial propeller UAV increases and the drag decreases as the propeller speed increases.

A fundamental function for safer auto-driving is to recognize the vehicles' locations, termed vehicular positioning. The state-of-the-art vehicular positioning is to rely on anchors that are stationary objects whose locations are known, i.e. satellites for GPS and base stations for cellular positioning. It is important for reliable positioning to install anchors densely, helping find enough anchors nearby. For the deployment to be cost-effective, there are some trials to use backscatter tags as alternative anchors by deploying them on a road surface, but its gain is limited by several reasons such as short contact time and difficulties in maintenance. Instead, we propose a new backscatter-tag assisted vehicular positioning system where tags are deployed along a roadside, which enables the extension of contact duration and facilitates the maintenance. On the other hand, there is a location mismatch between the vehicle and the tag, calling for developing a new backscatter transmission to estimate their relative position. To this end, we design a novel waveform called joint frequency-and-phase modulation (JFPM) for backscatter-tag assisted vehicular positioning where a transmit frequency is modulated for the distance estimation assuming that the relevant signal is clearly differentiable from the others while the phase modulation helps the differentiation. The JFPM waveform leads to exploiting the maximum Degree-of-Freedoms (DoFs) of backscatter channel in which multiple-access and broadcasting channels coexist, leading to more accurate positioning verified by extensive simulations. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Water resources, being one of the most important natural resources, face major threats due to contamination by pollutants of various types and origins. Maintaining the quality of water resources requires more robust, reliable and more frequent monitoring than traditional techniques of data collection based on sporadic, discontinuous and manual processes. The management of large geographical areas, the insufficient spatiotemporal discretization of the values of samples collected by traditional processes and the unpredictability of natural phenomena, require a new approach to data collection procedures. This article, which is the result of ongoing research, defines the technical requirements and technologies used in a continuous and regular monitoring of surface water quality in freshwater systems, whose data acquisition system helps to identify the sources of pollution and the contaminants flow along the waterways.

When anchored, the conceptual AUV can generate energy with on-board turbines, and can relocate itself when needed. Model predictive control (MPC)based centralized optimization is used to optimize the locations of a team of AUVs along a cross-stream transect. To maintain an accurate estimate of the transect flow profile, a Kalman filter-based estimator is used to blend flow speed measurements from the AUVs with intermittent auxiliary flow speed data from a High Frequency Radar Network (HFRNet). To characterize the uncertainty of the GS flow profile estimation, variance of flow speed is modeled using tools from Gaussian Process (GP).

In this experiment, we provide an approach that fulfills the necessities of rapid food security, assessment, planning, exploitation, and management of agricultural resources by introducing a pipeline for the automatic localization and classification of four types of fruit trees (coconut, banana, mango, and papaya) and the segmentation of roads in the Kingdom of Tonga, using high-resolution aerial imagery (0.04 m). We used two supervised deep convolutional neural network (CNN): the first, to localize and classify trees (localization) and the second, to mask the streets from the aerial imagery for transportation purposes (semantic segmentation).

This demand stresses the need for investigating novel methods that have the potential to dramatically increase the spectral efficiency (SE) of wireless systems. An evolving approach is the Single-channel full duplex (SCFD) communication where each node may simultaneously receive and transmit over the same frequency channel, and, hence, this could potentially double the current SE figures. In an earlier research work, we derived a model of the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) in an SCFD-based cellular system with imperfect self interference cancellation, and investigated interference management under feasible QoS requirements. In this paper, game theoretic results are exploited to investigate the intercell interference management in SCFD-based cellular networks under infeasible QoS requirements. The investigation starts with a game formulation that captures two different cases. Then, the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium point are established. After that, a computationally efficient distributed algorithm, which realizes best effort and fair wireless services, is designed. The merit of this scheme is that, when the QoS requirements are feasible, they will be achieved with minimum energy consumption.

With the continuous improvement of autonomy, the increasing complexity of tasks, and the emergence of various types of advanced sensors, higher requirements are imposed on the computing performance of USVs clusters, especially for latency sensitive tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes a fog-cloud computing architecture for USVs clusters, which dynamically allocates USVs cluster computing resources and cloud computing resources to achieve overall optimized computing performance. However, due to the mobility of USVs cluster nodes, the network topology, the wireless channel states and the available computing resources are changing rapidly and difficult to predict. In this work, we develop a learning-based task offloading framework using the multi-armed bandit (MAB) theory, which enables vehicles to learn the potential task offloading performance of its neighboring team nodes with excessive computing resources, and minimizes the average offloading delay. We propose an adaptive upper confidence bound (AUCB) algorithm and augment it with load-awareness and occurrence-awareness, by redesigning the utility function of the classic MAB algorithms. The proposed AUCB algorithm can effectively adapt to the dynamic marine fog computing environment, balance the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation in the learning process, and converge fast to the optimal computing nodes with theoretical performance guarantee. Simulations under synthetic scenario are carried out, showing that the proposed algorithm achieves close-to-optimal delay performance under both heavy and light input data load. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Object collision avoidance over a trajectory is the only built-in security mechanism in the autopilot system of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This mechanism, however, cannot protect drones from signal spoofing and hacking attacks. Attacks on UAVs can be triggered from either the ground or flying vehicles in the transmission vicinity medium, by means of which attackers get to control flight operations or manipulate the UAV's autopilot system. An intermittent network connection that disrupts communication in UAVs exacerbates the problem. Hence, a deep learning-based, adaptive Intrusion Detection System is needed for a drone to identify its intruders and ensure its safe return-to-home (RTH). In the proposed IDS, Self-Taught Learning (STL) with a multiclass SVM is used to maintain the high true positive rate of the IDS, even in uncharted territory. A self-healing method in IDS recovery phase uses the Deep-Q Network, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for dynamic route learning to facilitate the drone's safe return home.

In order to prevent UAVs from invading restricted areas or famous buildings, an anti-UAV defense system (AUDS) has been developed and become a research topic of interest. Topics under research in relation to this include electromagnetic interference guns for UAVs, high-energy laser guns, US military net warheads, and AUDSs with net guns. However, these AUDSs use either manual aiming or expensive radar to trace drones. This research proposes a dual-axis mechanism with UAVs automatic tracing. The tracing platform uses visual image processing technology to trace and lock the dynamic displacement of a drone. When a target UAV is locked, the system uses a nine-axis attitude meter and laser rangers to measure its flight altitude and calculates its longitude and latitude coordinates through sphere coordinates to provide drone monitoring for further defense or attack missions. Tracing tests of UAV flights in the air were carried out using a DJI MAVIC UAV at a height of 30 m to 100 m. It was set up for drone image capture and visual identification for tracing under various weather conditions by a thermal imaging camera and a full-color camera, respectively. When there was no cloud during the daytime, the images acquired by the thermal imaging camera and full-color camera provide a high-quality image identification result. However, under dark weather, black clouds will emit radiant energy and seriously affect the capture of images by a thermal imaging camera. When there is no cloud at night, the thermal imaging camera performs well in drone image capture. When the drone is traced and locked, the system can effectively obtain the flight altitude and longitude and latitude coordinate values. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

A timely detection of bark beetle infestation is therefore necessary to reduce losses. Besides wood production, a bark beetle outbreak affects the forest ecosystem in many other ways including the water cycle, nutrient cycle, or carbon fixation. On that account, (not just) European temperate coniferous forests may become endangered ecosystems. Our study was performed in the unmanaged zone of the Krkonoše Mountains National Park in the northern part of the Czech Republic where the natural spreading of bark beetle is slow and, therefore, allow us to continuously monitor the infested trees that are, in contrast to managed forests, not being removed. The aim of this work is to evaluate possibilities of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted low-cost RGB and modified near-infrared sensors for detection of different stages of infested trees at the individual level, using a retrospective time series for recognition of still green but already infested trees (so-called green attack). A mosaic was created from the UAV imagery, radiometrically calibrated for surface reflectance, and five vegetation indices were calculated; the reference data about the stage of bark beetle infestation was obtained through a combination of field survey and visual interpretation of an orthomosaic. The differences of vegetation indices between infested and healthy trees over four time points were statistically evaluated and classified using the Maximum Likelihood classifier. Achieved results confirm our assumptions that it is possible to use a low-cost UAV-based sensor for detection of various stages of bark beetle infestation across seasons; with increasing time after infection, distinguishing infested trees from healthy ones grows easier. The best performance was achieved by the Greenness Index with overall accuracy of 78%-96% across the time periods. The performance of the indices based on near-infrared band was lower. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Both mobile robots and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) can transport components among machines in the working space. Nevertheless, the difference is that mobile robots considered in this work can process specific value-added operations, which is not possible for AGVs. This new feature increases complexity as well as computational demands. To summarize, we need to compute a sequence of operations on machines, the robot assignments for transportation, and the robot assignments for processing. The main contribution is the proposal of an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm with the sets of exploration and exploitation heuristics to solve the problem considering makespan minimization. Experimental evaluation is presented on the existing benchmarks. The quality of our solutions is compared to a heuristic based on genetic algorithm and mixed-integer programming proposed recently. The comparison shows that our approach can achieve comparable results in real time which is in order of magnitude faster than the earlier heuristic. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This paper outlines a hierarchical vehicular social force control scheme that integrates both ideas. At the upper level, social force aggregation is applied to predictively select the most efficient lane over a long horizon covered by connectivity. This is then passed down to a lower level controller that enforces lane tracking while considering higher fidelity social force resolution and lane-changing dynamics within the shorter horizon captured by the ego vehicle's sensor field of view.

However, since the Global Positioning System cannot be exploited underwater, the AUV position is not directly measurable in real time (unless using dedicated acoustic-based sensors), making the availability of a reliable navigation system even more crucial. In this context, the main role is played by the filter used to estimate the AUV motion, usually relying on simple kinematic vehicle models and equations linearization. A navigation strategy specifically thought for AUVs and based on an unscented Kalman filter is proposed and experimentally validated by the authors. Preliminary tests of the developed strategy have been carried out by running the navigation filter on experimental data acquired during the FP7 European ARROWS project. This initial validation has been performed totally offline. The AUVs navigated in dead reckoning without using navigation filters, whereas the proposed strategy has been compared to standard extended Kalman filter based ones, highlighting encouraging performances. To further validate the proposed navigation system, suitable sea tests have been performed. The navigation filter has been implemented online on an AUV and the vehicle controller relied only on it to navigate. The new validation procedure, whose results are reported in this paper, showed again the good performance of the chosen strategy, yielding satisfying results in terms of accuracy of vehicle position estimation. © 1976-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Although this problem has been studied in the past, there has not been a method that guarantees both goal satisfaction and safety for vehicles with general nonlinear dynamics, while taking into account disturbances and potential adversarial agents, to the best of our knowledge. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is the ideal tool for guaranteeing goal satisfaction and safety under such scenarios, which has been successfully applied to many small-scale problems; however, its direct application in most cases becomes intractable when there are more than two vehicles due to the exponentially scaling computational complexity with respect to system dimension. In this paper, we take advantage of the guarantees provided by HJ reachability and eliminate the computation burden by assigning a strict priority ordering to vehicles under consideration. Under this sequential trajectory planning (STP) scheme, vehicles reserve 'space-time' portions in the airspace. The space-time portions guarantee dynamic feasibility, collision avoidance, and optimality of trajectories given the priority ordering. With a computation complexity that scales quadratically when accounting for both disturbances and an intruder, and linearly when accounting for only disturbances, the STP can tractably solve the multivehicle trajectory planning problem for vehicles with general nonlinear dynamics in a practical setting.

To avoid adverse consequences (detection or crash) caused by frequent changes in UAV flight during the GPS spoofing attacks, the proposed algorithm requires that the deception trajectory planned by the GPS spoofer is slowly changing relative to the reference trajectory, which is pre-set by the UAV.

As it involves wireless communications, securing the privacy-related data is a key constraint in WBAN. To ensure privacy, it is essential to include authentication to prevent unauthorized access by intruders. This paper proposes the privacy preserving LightwEight two factors Authentication Protocol (LEAP) for WBAN based on genus-2 Hyper Elliptic Curve (HEC). Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) collects signals from sensors from the BAN. PDA transmits the healthcare data to the Healthcare Service Provider (HSP) connected in the public network. Hence, the two-factor mutual authentication protocol is established between PDA and HSP. Since PDA is considered as a resource constraint device, the lightweight mutual authentication is required. Genus 2 Hyper elliptic curve (HEC) is carefully designed to prevent all possible cryptographic attacks, which is more suitable for lightweight authentication since it provides the high degree of security with the lesser key size even as compared to the elliptic curve. Using the rigorous formal security analysis using BAN logic, it is proved that the proposed scheme is secure against possible attacks. Also, the privacy preserving lightweight authentication scheme is implemented using the most-widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool, and the simulation results reveal that proposed scheme is secure and robust. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

As new treatments emerge, it is necessary to develop methods for reliably assessing patients' disease status and stratifying risk of progression. The presence of drusen in the retina represents a key early feature in which size, number, and morphology are thought to correlate significantly with the risk of progression to sight-threatening age-related macular degeneration. Manual labeling of drusen on color fundus photographs by a human is labor intensive and is where automatic computerized detection would appreciably aid patient care.

The changes in a series of parameters during the UAV launching under different ambient wind conditions were obtained through simulation experiments. Consequently, the influence of environmental wind on zero-length launch safety was analyzed. The experimental result shows that if the take-off direction can be selected, the UAV should be launched against the wind, and for a directional launch, it should be launched when the ambient wind speed is less than 6 m/s. For either downwind launch or crosswind launch, if the angle of attack is positive after launch, i.e., the UAV does not deviate from the predetermined trajectory, then the launch and take-off processes of the UAV are safe. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of HEU.

Through such systems, clients are verified and permitted to login to the system according to their physical or behavioral traits. Biometric systems offer several advantages over traditional authentication methods. Moreover, these systems, protects the privacy of clients, confidentiality and integrity of critical information for emerging technology such as smartphones and other appliances. In this paper, we improved our previous biometric authentication system and through some practical scenarios, we considered different attacks from client, server, and network sides to intrude into the privacy.

A saturation control scheme with hyperbolic tangent function is designed for the position loop controller to ensure non-singular command attitude extraction and the effect of nonlinear coupling between the position and attitude subsystem is subsequently analyzed. The problem of sign-ambiguity commonly appears in reference attitude is overcome using arc tangent function by considering the signs of both the arguments. To obviate the problem of singularity during attitude tracking, a non-singular attitude loop controller using barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) with corresponding initial condition constraint is proposed. A rigorous stability analysis proves that the overall closed-loop system is asymptotically stable (AS) and all the signals are bounded in the cascaded control structure. The singularity-free hierarchical control development and its stability analysis exploits the full state space Euler-Lagrange under-actuated dynamics in terms of generalized coordinates with generalized force and torque collocated with generalized velocities.

In particular, deep neural networks (DNNs) provide good performance for image, speech, and pattern recognition. However, a poisoning attack is a serious threat to a DNN's security. A poisoning attack reduces the accuracy of a DNN by adding malicious training data during the training process. In some situations, it may be necessary to drop a specifically chosen class of accuracy from the model. For example, if an attacker specifically disallows nuclear facilities to be selectively recognized, it may be necessary to intentionally prevent unmanned aerial vehicles from correctly recognizing nuclear-related facilities. In this paper, we propose a selective poisoning attack that reduces the accuracy of only the chosen class in the model. The proposed method achieves this by training malicious data corresponding to only the chosen class while maintaining the accuracy of the remaining classes. For the experiment, we used tensorflow as the machine-learning library as well as MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR10 as the datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the accuracy of the chosen class by 43.2%, 41.7%, and 55.3% in MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR10, respectively, while maintaining the accuracy of the remaining classes. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Breeding of Verticillium wilt resistance into commercially viable strawberry cultivars can help mitigate the impact of the disease. In this study we describe novel sources of resistance identified in multiple strawberry populations, creating a wealth of data for breeders to exploit. Pathogen-informed experiments have allowed the differentiation of subclade-specific resistance responses, through studying V. dahliae subclade II-1 specific resistance in the cultivar “Redgauntlet” and subclade II-2 specific resistance in “Fenella” and “Chandler.” A large-scale low-cost phenotyping platform was developed utilizing automated unmanned vehicles and near infrared imaging cameras to assess field-based disease trials. The images were used to calculate disease susceptibility for infected plants through the normalized difference vegetation index score. The automated disease scores showed a strong correlation with the manual scores. A co-dominant resistant QTL; FaRVd3D, present in both “Redgauntlet” and “Hapil” cultivars exhibited a major effect of 18.3% when the two resistance alleles were combined. Another allele, FaRVd5D, identified in the “Emily” cultivar was associated with an increase in Verticillium wilt susceptibility of 17.2%, though whether this allele truly represents a susceptibility factor requires further research, due to the nature of the F1 mapping population. Markers identified in populations were validated across a set of 92 accessions to determine whether they remained closely linked to resistance genes in the wider germplasm. The resistant markers FaRVd2B from “Redgauntlet” and FaRVd6D from “Chandler” were associated with resistance across the wider germplasm. Furthermore, comparison of imaging versus manual phenotyping revealed the automated platform could identify three out of four disease resistance markers. As such, this automated wilt disease phenotyping platform is considered to be a good, time saving, substitute for manual assessment. © 2019 Cockerton, Li, Vickerstaff, Eyre, Sargent, Armitage, Marina-Montes, Garcia-Cruz, Passey, Simpson and Harrison.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It is dominantly thought that the singularity and formalisation of structures like rules is what enables regulation to achieve its aim of identifying, apprehending, sanctioning and forestalling/pre-empting threats and crime or harm. From this point of view, regulation serves to firmly establish fixed and stable categories of what norms, customs, morals and behaviours are applicable to a particular territory, society or community in a given time. These fixed categories are then transmitted onto individuals by convention, ritual and enforcement through imperatives of law (and technology) that mark certain behaviours as permissible and others as forbidden, off bounds. In this manner, regulation serves a programming (i.e., a calculable or determinable) purpose. It functions as a pro-active management or as a mastery of threats, risks, crimes and harms that affect a society and its security both in the future and in the present. Regulation for instance, will inscribe and codify what it determines to constitute crime or harm such as pornography, incitement of terrorism, extremist speech, racial hatred etc. These determined or calculated/calculable categories will then be enforced and regulated (e.g. through automated filtering) in order to ensure a preservation of public order within society. Drawing mainly from deconstruction, this article situates law and technologies within a wider ecological process of texts, speech and writing i.e., communication. In placing regulation within disseminatory and iterable processes of communication, this article complicates, destabilises and critiques the dominant position of determinability and calculability within the regulatory operations of law. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

The novelty of our MPC stems from the following results. Firstly, we adopt an alternating minimization approach wherein linear velocities and angular accelerations are alternately optimized. We show that in contrast to the joint optimization, the alternating minimization exploits the structure of the problem better, which in turn translates to reduction in computation time. Secondly, our MPC explicitly incorporates the time dependent non-linear actuator dynamics that captures the transient response of the vehicle for a given commanded velocity. This added complexity improves the predictive component of MPC resulting in improved margin of inter-vehicle distance during maneuvers like overtaking, lane-change, etc. Although, past works have also incorporated actuator dynamics within MPC, there has been very few attempts towards coupling actuator dynamics to collision avoidance constraints through the non-holonomic motion model of the vehicle and analyzing the resulting behavior. We use a high fidelity simulator to benchmark our actuator dynamics augmented MPC with other related approaches in terms of metrics like inter-vehicle distance, trajectory smoothness, and velocity overshoot. © 2019 American Automatic Control Council.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The aims of this study were to determine the intensity and characteristics of the outbreaks, as well as the clinical manifestations in the patients, the risk factors for infection and the pathogen responsible for the two outbreaks. Methods: An outbreak investigation was conducted in two primary schools, and a case-control study including patients from the Weixi County Ethnic Primary School was performed. Relevant specimens were collected according to the case definition, and next-generation sequencing was employed to identify the pathogen. An epidemiological investigation method was used to analyse the related epidemiological characteristics, such as risk factors. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by MEGA 7.0. Results: A total of 331 acute conjunctivitis cases, including probable cases of EKC, were reported in the two schools, and the attack rates were 30.59% (171/559, 95%CI: 26.76-34.42) and 20.41% (160/784, 95%CI: 17.58-23.24), respectively. Cases occurred in all grades and classes in both schools, and only one staff member in each school presented illness. The epidemics lasted for 54 days and 45 days, respectively. The patients had typical manifestations of EKC, such as acute onset, follicular hyperplasia, pseudomembrane formation, preauricular lymphadenopathy, corneal involvement and blurred vision, and a relatively long disease course (average 9.40 days, longest 23 days and shortest 7 days). The risk factor for infection was close contact with a patient or personal items contaminated by a patient. The pathogen responsible for the outbreaks was HAdV-8. The virus was highly similar to the 2016 HAdV-8 strain from Tibet, China. Conclusions: This study strongly suggests that HAdV-8 could lead to serious consequences. This is the second report of a HAdV-8-associated EKC outbreak in mainland China. Tibetan HAdV-8 might be circulating in southwest China; therefore, it is necessary to monitor the pathogens causing acute conjunctivitis in this area. © 2019 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

This approach can be described as follows: a near-surface straight trajectory which is perpendicular to the predicted ship trajectory is figured out by detection device of UUV which is hidden underwater after the ship target is located. When the horizontal distance between UUV and the ship target meets start-up condition, UUV climbs to a certain depth near the sea surface and then runs along the horizontal straight trajectory. During its motion, UUV periodically measures the sight line between the UUV and ship target. In order to restrain the horizontal rotation of the sight line, a discontinuous guidance approach is proposed by using the deviation of the two adjacent sight lines and the distance between the UUV and the ship target to adjust the UUV’s velocity. After certain times of adjustment of the UUV’s velocity, UUV impacts the side of ship target perpendicularly with required accuracy. This near-surface discontinuous guidance approach makes it possible for UUV to be guided through optical or radar detection. Further discussions are made including miss distance caused by this proposed guidance approach, cycle of sight line detection, UUV’s non-attack zone and UUV start-up condition. Finally, a set of HILS is carried out to demonstrate the performance of the discontinuous guidance approach on an experimentally validated UUV model. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In a UAV-aided WSN, CHs (Cluster Heads) take charge of a crucial role such as gathering data from members and delivering the gathered data to a UAV. Such an important and critical role of CHs makes attackers enthusiastic in turning their compromised nodes to CHs. In the general CH election framework, each node determines its CH role by itself, and this allows a compromised node to become a CH even if it is a disqualified node. This paper presents a UAV-aided CH election framework where a UAV gathers residual energy of nodes and delivers them to the sink, which elects new CHs or disqualified candidates and delivers the new CHs or the disqualified candidates to the network. As depicted in simulation results, the UAV-aided CH election framework significantly diminishes CH elections of compromised nodes and corrupted messages per second. In addition, the UAV-aided CH election framework hugely diminishes energy consumption of nodes, and extends both lifetime of nodes and network lifetime.

Shop-floor resources create data streams that are saved in databases, cleaned, and then re-contextualized, i.e., to connect the data to orders, batches, and single products. New analysis prospects arise when integrating this data and analysis methods with the process-oriented analysis perspective. This paper exploits these prospects based on a real-world case: BPMN models are created for the manufacturing of two real-world products: (1) a low volume, high complexity lower-housing for a gas turbine and (2) a high volume, low complexity, small tolerance valve lifter for a gas turbine. Instead of collecting the data independently based on the participating machines, the data collection of 30+ values is modeled into the BPMN models and enacted by a workflow engine, resulting in execution logs.

A number of studies have been conducted on how to achieve a FANET, but few have considered the security perspectives of this subject. FANET's unique features have made it difficult to strengthen its defense against ever-changing security threats. Today, more and more FANET applications are implemented into civil airspace, but the development of FANET security has remained unsatisfactory. In this paper, we try to address this issue by proposing a new Intrusion Detection System (IDS), an hybrid method based on both spectral traffic analysis and a robust controller / observer for anomaly estimation inside UAV networks. The proposed hybrid method considers, as a preliminary step, a statistical signature of the traffic exchanged in the network. By examining the resulted signatures, the differences are used to select the accurate model for accurate estimation of that abnormal traffic. The proposed IDS design has been successfully applied to some relevant practical problems such as ad hoc networks for aerial vehicles, and the effectiveness is illustrated by using real traffic traces including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Our first results show promising perspectives for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in UAV communication networks. Indeed, different types of anomaly have been considered and they are all accurately detected by the intrusion detection process we propose in this paper.

The established control strategy is compared with a fuzzy control energy management strategy that only considering the state of the energy system. Based on the typical task characteristics of high-power short-term climb and low-power long-time cruise, the optimal hybrid problem of fuel cell/battery is established. The optimal hybrid of fuel cell and battery with the optimal power distribution and flight control are derived. The influence of different cruise target altitudes on optimal hybrid fuel cell/battery and flight state is analyzed. The results show that the proposed coupling optimal control strategy considering both energy system and path planning can provide a good flight state control while giving optimal power flow distribution. Considering the characteristics of long-term low-power cruise and short-time high-power climb, the optimization results of hybrid fuel cell/battery and flight state control present optimal flight state while reducing fuel consumption throughout the mission. © 2019, Press of Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.

Since the UAV communication link and its reliability evaluation represent an arduous field, we have concentrated our work on this topic. A UAV communication channel is a key factor that can affect the performance of the data link in terms of high data rate and reliable transmission of information. Moreover, the wireless communication channel opens up the door for several types of remote attacks. Therefore, the communication channel between the vehicle and ground control station (GCS) should be secure and has to provide an efficient data link. For this purpose, we have investigated the one-time pad (OTP) encryption technique for a UAV communication system. The comparative results present that OTP has better performance in terms of accuracy and execution time than other encryption algorithms. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This article introduces AbSRiM, a novel agent-based modeling and simulation approach to perform security risk management for airport operations that uses formal sociotechnical models that include temporal and spatial aspects. The approach contains four main steps: scope selection, agent-based model definition, risk assessment, and risk mitigation. The approach is based on traditional security risk management methodologies, but uses agent-based modeling and Monte Carlo simulation at its core. Agent-based modeling is used to model threat scenarios, and Monte Carlo simulations are then performed with this model to estimate security risks. The use of the AbSRiM approach is demonstrated with an illustrative case study. This case study includes a threat scenario in which an adversary attacks an airport terminal with an improvised explosive device. The approach provides a promising way to include important elements, such as human aspects and spatiotemporal aspects, in the assessment of risk. More research is still needed to better identify the strengths and weaknesses of the AbSRiM approach in different case studies, but results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and its potential. © 2019 The Authors Risk Analysis.","Article","Final","Scopus"

RGB-D cameras are promising sensors for fruit detection given that they provide geometrical information with color data. Some of these sensors work on the principle of time-of-flight (ToF) and, besides color and depth, provide the backscatter signal intensity. However, this radiometric capability has not been exploited for fruit detection applications. This work presents the KFuji RGB-DS database, composed of 967 multi-modal images containing a total of 12,839 Fuji apples. Compilation of the database allowed a study of the usefulness of fusing RGB-D and radiometric information obtained with Kinect v2 for fruit detection. To do so, the signal intensity was range corrected to overcome signal attenuation, obtaining an image that was proportional to the reflectance of the scene. A registration between RGB, depth and intensity images was then carried out. The Faster R-CNN model was adapted for use with five-channel input images: color (RGB), depth (D) and range-corrected intensity signal (S). Results show an improvement of 4.46% in F1-score when adding depth and range-corrected intensity channels, obtaining an F1-score of 0.898 and an AP of 94.8% when all channels are used. From our experimental results, it can be concluded that the radiometric capabilities of ToF sensors give valuable information for fruit detection. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Conventional WPCNs rely only on dedicated downlink wireless power transfer (WPT), which is practically inefficient due to the significant energy loss in wireless signal propagation. Meanwhile, ambient energy harvesting is highly appealing as devices can scavenge energy from various existing energy sources (e.g., solar energy and cellular signals). Unfortunately, the randomness of the availability of these energy sources cannot guarantee stable communication services.Motivated by the above statements, we consider a generalized WPCN where the devices can not only harvest energy from a dedicated multiple-Antenna power station (PS), but can also exploit stored energy stemming from ambient energy harvesting. Since the dedicated WPT consumes system resources, if the stored energy is sufficient, WPTmay not be needed to maximize theweighted sum rate. To analytically characterize this phenomenon, we derive the condition forWPT activation and reveal how it is affected by the different system parameters. Subsequently, we further derive the optimal resource allocation policy for the cases thatWPT is activated and deactivated, respectively. In particular, it is found that whenWPT is activated, the optimal energy beamforming at the PS does not depend on the devices stored energy, which is shown to lead to a new unfairness issue. Simulation results verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal resource allocation. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

The MSCKF is a well-known visual inertial odometry (VIO) method that performs the fusion between an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the image measurements within a sliding window. The MSCKF computes the re-projection errors from the camera measurements and the states in the sliding window. During this process, the structure-only estimation is performed without exploiting the full information over the window, like the relative interstate motion constraints and their uncertainties. The key contribution of this paper is combination of the filtering and non-linear optimization method for VIO, and the design of a novel measurement model that exploits all of the measurements and information available within the sliding window. The local visual-inertial optimization is performed using pre-integrated IMU measurements and camera measurements. It infers the probabilistically optimal relative pose constraints. These local optimal constraints are used to estimate the global states under the MSCKF framework. The proposed local-optimal-multi-state constraint Kalman filter is validated using a simulation data set, as well as publicly available real-world data sets generated from real-world urban driving experiments. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Then, the detection problem of abnormal power emission is mathematically formulated as a ternary-hypothesis test. To achieve the tradeoff between false alarm and missed detection, a generalized Neyman-Pearson test criterion is proposed, where the detection probability is maximized under two false-alarm constraints.

Each year, sepsis claims the lives of at least 250,000 people. Real-time, automated surveillance for sepsis among hospitalized patients is of critical importance, given that one in three people who die in hospitals have sepsis. The early identification and treatment of sepsis is associated with reduced mortality and costly intensive care bed days. The objective of this analysis was to improve the performance of an electronic medical record based sepsis algorithm (early identification) and improve evidence based bundle compliance (early intervention) with the addition of a real-time, automated time zero calculation. Methods: Data from our enterprise-wide health information systems were landed in a data lake platform and was used to statistically validate existing sepsis algorithms. An additional algorithm calculating time zero was introduced and a post-hoc comparison of measures of test performance, alert timing, bundle compliance, ICU length of stay, and all-hospital mortality were performed. Results: A total of 55,918 alerts for sepsis were generated over the one-year study period across 30 inpatient facilities. The addition of an automated time zero algorithm improved several key indicators including superior positive predictive value (37% to 52%), enhanced timing of the alert (79% occurred within six hours, 77% within the critical 180-minute SEP-1 window, 47% within an hour of time zero), a 14% increase in bundle compliance, a 10% reduction in ICU length of stay, and a decrease in mortality from sepsis. Conclusions: The addition of a real-time, automated sepsis time zero calculation improved the performance and timeliness of a predictive sepsis alert provided through a system developed mobile application for clinicians and administrators. © mHealth.

Instead, these progressive trends collided with a turn in intersex management toward infants, who were unable to provide autonomous consent about their medical care. Patient autonomy took a back seat as parents heeded physicians' advice in an environment even more hierarchical than we know today.

However, if a UAV swarm relies on centralized control, synchronization of swarm members, pre-planned actions or rule-based systems, it may not provide adequate and timely response against cyber attacks. We introduce game theory (GT) and biology inspired flight control algorithms to be run by each autonomous UAV to detect, localize and counteract rogue electromagnetic signal emitters. Each UAV positions itself such that the swarm tracks mobile adversaries while maintaining uniform node distribution and connectivity of the mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). UAVs use only their respective local neighbor information to determine their individual actions. Simulation experiments in OPNET show that our algorithms can provide an adequate area coverage over mobile interference sources. Our solution can be employed for civilian and military applications that require agile responses in dynamic environments. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

We present a novel noninvasive and fully automated method that uses the inspired sinewave technique to continuously monitor cardiac output (Q˙IST). Methods: Over successive breaths the inspired nitrous oxide (N2O) concentration was forced to oscillate sinusoidally with a fixed mean (4%), amplitude (3%), and period (60 s). Q˙IST was determined in a single-compartment tidal ventilation lung model that used the resulting amplitude/phase of the expired N2O sinewave. The agreement and trending ability of Q˙IST were compared with Q˙T during pharmacologically induced haemodynamic changes, before and after repeated lung lavages, in eight anaesthetised pigs. Results: Before lung lavage, changes in Q˙IST and Q˙T from baseline had a mean bias of –0.52 L min−1 (95% confidence interval [CI], –0.41 to –0.63). The concordance between Q˙IST and Q˙T was 92.5% as assessed by four-quadrant analysis, and polar plot analysis revealed a mean angular bias of 5.98° (95% CI, –24.4°–36.3°). After lung lavage, concordance was slightly reduced (89.4%), and the mean angular bias widened to 21.8° (–4.2°, 47.6°). Impaired trending ability correlated with shunt fraction (r=0.79, P<0.05). Conclusions: The inspired sinewave technique provides continuous and noninvasive monitoring of cardiac output, with a ‘marginal–good’ trending ability compared with cardiac output based on thermodilution. However, the trending ability can be reduced with increasing shunt fraction, such as in acute lung injury. © 2019 The Authors","Article","Final","Scopus"

Current federal regulations for sUAS lay out rules for safe operation, including measures to prevent collision with manned aircraft under limited concepts of operation. However, these regulations are effective only to the extent that they are followed. While some sUAS have regulation-based limitations coded in their software (e.g., an altitude ceiling) to prevent violations, many regulations rely on the sUAS's operator's knowledge and compliance. Relying on regulation compliance to ensure safety is insufficient; multiple instances have occurred where initial detection of a trespassing sUAS was from a pilot visually spotting the sUAS. Visual detection additionally cannot be relied on during low visibility and low light conditions when visual detection of a sUAS would be extremely difficult. Instead, a surveillance system may be needed to identify trespassing sUAS to maintain safe distances between manned aircraft and sUAS to prevent loss of life or damage to property. This paper examines manned aircraft radar tracks from 2015 to quantitively evaluate and categorize airspace usage characteristics with regards to potential surveillance solutions. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

For example, car accidents, emergency sickness, sport related injuries, physical attacks, etc. When they occur, ambulances or emergency services are always needed so they bring the affected persons to the hospital. The major issue of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) include 1) the exact location of the patient is unknown and it takes a long time to reach him/her 2) first aid is given in a wrong way hence reduced survival chance 3) no AED (Automated External Defibrillator) available which actually is very crucial for survival. Researchers have developed a platform to respond such emergency situations in a more effective manner. The development is made on medical basis i.e. the shortest response time, the right way to give first aid that the patient really needs, and the fastest to reach doctor. Our developed system utilized multiple technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, and web real-time communication in order to obtain medical advices as fast as possible and real time. When system development is completely done, it will be put on trial in Prachinburi province, Thailand. However, the results of this experimental indicate that it can make accurate connection to webcam up to 93% and response time is 1-3.5 seconds. Video calling resolution is satisfactory i.e. 96% of the connection is correct with only 0.5 second delay. What is surprising is that when multiple lines are connected, delay is slightly increased which is 1.57 seconds and this is a satisfactory result. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Radar cross section is a measure of a target's ability to reflect radar signals in the direction of the receiver. It is obvious that RCS depends on the shape of the reflecting objects. In this paper, a brief overview of various radars used in surveillance applications and radar cross section (RCS) measurement techniques are presented. The objective of this paper is to illustrate methods for obtaining the Radar Cross Section (RCS) of a typical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for various frequencies in radar bands. UAV technologies have advanced tremendously and are being developed successfully. These features lead UAV to patrol even in civil airspace for civilian applications. These objects operate with small radar cross-section and/or on low altitude which imposes security threat. Keeping this view the RCS of a UAV which are flying in civilian airspace has to be determined drastically for security purposes. Several shapes are considered for the estimation of RCS. The results on the variations of RCS for the above objects as a function of frequency, aspect angle are presented. The POFACETS plays a crucial role and provides the user an easy–to–use GUI that allows the input of all necessary parameters, while preventing erroneous data input and other user errors.

In contrast to other methods that do not utilize the statistical model of the shadow region, our algorithm combines highlight detection and shadow detection using a weighted likelihood ratio test, while exploiting the expected spatial distribution of potential objects. We detect highlights by a higher-order-statistics representation of the image, followed by a segmentation process to form a region-of-interest (ROI). Then, while taking into account the sonar elevation and scan angle, for each ROI, we use a support vector machine (SVM) over the statistical features of the pixels within the ROI to detect shadow-related pixels and background pixels. Our algorithm has the benefit of being robust as a result of setting its main parameters in situ. Moreover, we do not require knowledge about the target's shape or size, thereby making our algorithm suitable for all sonar detection applications and sonar types. To test detection performance, using our own autonomous underwater vehicle, we collected 270 sonar images, which we also share with the community. Compared to the results of benchmark schemes, our detection algorithm shows a trade-off between the probability of detection and the false alarm rate (FAR), which is close to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence lower bound. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Previously, various scanning trajectories were analyzed for the system function reconstruction (SFR) approach, providing important insight regarding their image quality performances. While Cartesian trajectories remain the most popular choice for x-space-based reconstruction, recent work suggests that non-Cartesian trajectories such as the Lissajous trajectory may prove beneficial for improving image quality. In this work, we propose a generalized reconstruction scheme for x-space MPI that can be used in conjunction with any scanning trajectory. The proposed technique automatically tunes the reconstruction parameters from the scanning trajectory, and does not induce any additional blurring. To demonstrate the proposed technique, we utilize five different trajectories with varying density levels. Comparison to alternative reconstruction methods show significant improvement in image quality achieved by the proposed technique. Among the tested trajectories, the Lissajous and bidirectional Cartesian trajectories prove more favorable for x-space MPI, and the resolution of the images from these two trajectories can further be improved via deblurring. The proposed fully automated gridding reconstruction can be utilized with these trajectories to improve the image quality in x-space MPI. © 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To ensure their security, Web servers try to identify bot sessions and apply special rules to them, such as throttling their requests or delivering different content. The methods currently used for the identification of bots are based either purely on rule-based bot detection techniques or a combination of rule-based and machine learning techniques.

However, vulnerabilities of software in autonomous driving can lead to vehicle components and systems being attacked, which ultimately affects the work of the autonomous vehicle. Although many scholars have detected malware on X86-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices through static or dynamic analysis, these methods cannot be directly ported to X86-based IoT devices in autonomous driving because of hardware and software capabilities and real-time requirements. In this work, we propose the detection of malware on X86-based IoT devices in an autonomous driving approach combining fusion features from static analysis and machine learning to solve problems of resource overhead for dynamic analysis and low accuracy of the static analysis. First, a feature extraction model based on the level of operation code is designed. Then fusion features at three different levels are extracted through unpacking programs. Finally, a detection model based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is used to discover malware on X86-based IoT devices in autonomous driving. On this basis, a malware detection approach based on fusion features is demonstrated. After that, we compare our approach with other identification approaches on a dataset consisting of 4169 samples, which includes 2379 malware and 1790 benign programs.

This breaking process is needed only when over-sized rocks threaten to jam the mine material flow. In the worst case, a pile of overlapped rocks can get stuck on top of a crusher's grate plate. For a human operator, it is relatively easy to make the decisions about the rock locations in the pile and the order of rocks to be crushed. In an autonomous operation, a robust and fast visual perception system is needed for executing robot motion commands.

Varying the interpolation parameter in this formulation turns out to result in an interesting family of optimal braking and steering patterns in stabilising manoeuvres. The two different strategies of optimal lane-keeping control and optimal yaw control are shown to be embedded in the formulation and result from the boundary values of the parameter.

To design respective communication systems, accurate air-to-air (A2A) channel models are needed, especially for urban environments, where the channel characteristics are hard to predict due to rich multipath propagation, diffractions and non line of sight (LOS) conditions. For these models, channel measurements in different scenarios are inevitable to model the real-world communication channel. However, small sized UAVs are very limited in carrying payload and in power supply, making it difficult or often impossible to use high performing channel-sounding hardware equipment. As a result, less resource demanding hardware with lower performance in the sense of clock synchronization, time resolution or dynamic range is usually applied leading to a limited propagation channel characterization. In this work, we describe a measurement setup that allows using arbitrary channel sounder hardware by exploiting analog optical links in order to enable A2A wideband channel measurements between small sized UAVs. We extend the operation of our MEDAV RUSKDLR channel sounder by guiding a 100 MHz bandwidth radio frequency (RF) signal at 5.2 GHz through two 600 m long optical fibers attached on two hexacopters after being converted with high bandwidth converters and show the feasibility of this setup with first flight trials in an urban scenario. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In the absence of obstacles, satellite based navigation from departure to the geo-located destination is a simple task. When obstacles are known to be in the path, pilots must build a flight plan to avoid them. However, when they are unknown, there are too many or they are in places that are not fixed positions, then to build a safe flight plan becomes very challenging. Moreover, in a weak satellite signal environment, such as indoors, under trees canopy or in urban canyons, the current drone navigation systems may fail. Artificial intelligence, a research area with increasing activity, can be used to overcome such challenges. Initially focused on robots and now mostly applied to ground vehicles, artificial intelligence begins to be used also to train drones. Reinforcement learning is the branch of artificial intelligence able to train machines. The application of reinforcement learning to drones will provide them with more intelligence, eventually converting drones in fully-autonomous machines. In this work, reinforcement learning is studied for drone delivery. As sensors, the drone only has a stereo-vision front camera, from which depth information is obtained. The drone is trained to fly to a destination in a neighborhood environment that has plenty of obstacles such as trees, cables, cars and houses. The flying area is also delimited by a geo-fence; this is a virtual (non-visible) fence that prevents the drone from entering or leaving a defined area. The drone has to avoid visible obstacles and has to reach a goal. Results show that, in comparison with the previous results, the new algorithms have better results, not only with a better reward, but also with a reduction of its variance. The second contribution is the checkpoints. They consist of saving a trained model every time a better reward is achieved. Results show how checkpoints improve the test results. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Article","Final","Scopus"

By virtue of a buffer, the RN can reserve the data at the buffer when the the channel gain between an RN and a destination node (DN) is weaker than that between SN and RN. The RN then opportunistically forward the reserved data in the buffer according to channel condition between the RN and the DN. By exploiting the buffer, RN reduces transmit power when it reduces the transmit data rate and reserve the data in the buffer. Therefore, without any total throughput reduction, the power consumption of RN can be reduced, resulting in the energy efficiency (EE) improvement of the RN system. Furthermore, for the power control, we devise a simple power control method based on a two-dimensional surface fitting model of an optimal transmit power of RN. The proposed RN power control method is readily and locally implementable at the RN, and it can significantly improve EE of the RN compared to the fixed power control method and the spectral efficiency based method as verified by the rigorous numerical results. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The ever-increasing cyber components of vehicles (i.e., computation, communication, and control), however, incur new risks of anomalies, as demonstrated by the millions of vehicles recalled by different manufactures. To mitigate these risks, we design B-Diag, a battery-based diagnostics system that guards vehicles against anomalies with a cyber-physical approach, and implement B-Diag as an add-on module of commodity vehicles attached to automotive batteries, thus providing vehicles an additional layer of protection. B-Diag is inspired by the fact that the automotive battery operates in strong dependency with many physical components of the vehicle, which is observable as correlations between battery voltage and the vehicle's corresponding operational parameters, e.g., a faster revolutions-per-minute (RPM) of the engine, in general, leads to a higher battery voltage. B-Diag exploits such physically-induced correlations to diagnose vehicles by cross-validating the vehicle information with battery voltage, based on a set of data-driven norm models constructed online. Such a design of B-Diag is steered by a dataset collected with a prototype system when driving a 2018 Subaru Crosstrek in real-life over 3 months, covering a total mileage of about 1, 400 miles. Besides the Crosstrek, we have also evaluated B-Diag with driving traces of a 2008 Honda Fit, a 2018 Volvo XC60, and a 2017 Volkswagen Passat, showing B-Diag detects vehicle anomalies with >86% (up to 99%) averaged detection rate. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Although gully erosion intensity is highly impacted by catchment area changes, few studies have focused on the relevant mechanisms. This study presents a new approach to studying this issue by combining historic aerial photography and recent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery to determine changes in gully morphology over 40 years on China's Loess Plateau, one of the world's most erosion-prone regions. Aerial photographs from 1976 were matched with UAV imagery taken in 2017 to compare gully and surface conditions in two study areas over time. Next, a new method was developed for calculating changes in gully volume and erosion moduli based on the UAV-derived digital surface model. Finally, the impacts of catchment area change on gully erosion moduli over the study period were analyzed. The results showed that the catchment areas decreased by 0.71–77.88%; greater decreases resulted in lower gully erosion moduli (with an exponential correlation) and reducing catchment area effectively slowed gully development. In addition, regional agricultural terrace construction has reduced the catchment areas, in turn reducing the amount of runoff entering gullies and thus reducing incision. Therefore, the management and maintenance of abandoned terraces should be strengthened by local governments and stakeholders to reduce runoff-induced gully erosion and sediment loss from upslope areas. The methodologies and results of this study have the potential to provide significant scientific references for the conservation of runoff and sediment in erosion-prone regions of China and elsewhere. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, based on static equilibrium analysis of the quadrotor mode of a QFHUAV with a wind disturbance, a method for analyzing and evaluating the wind disturbance rejection capability of the QFHUAV in the quadrotor mode is presented. The six degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) static equilibrium equations of the QFHUAV are established in headwind and crosswind situations. The maximum wind velocity that satisfies the equilibrium equations under the constraints of the maximum thrust and torque of the quadrotor propulsion system is used to determine the wind disturbance rejection capability of the QFHUAV in the quadrotor mode. A QFHUAV with a twin-boom is used as an example to analyze and evaluate its wind disturbance rejection capability in the quadrotor mode. The configuration parameters, quadrotor propulsion system parameters, and aerodynamic parameters affecting the wind disturbance rejection capability of the QFHUAV in the quadrotor mode are presented, discussed, and explained. The yawing moment from the wind disturbance is the main factor threatening the safe flight of the QFHUAV in the quadrotor mode. The rotor disk angle, the maximum thrust of the quadrotor propulsion system, and the moment arms of the components of the quadrotor propulsion system thrust are the main factors affecting the wind disturbance rejection capability of the QFHUAV in the quadrotor mode. Increasing these parameter values is an effective approach to improve the wind disturbance rejection capability of the QFHUAV in the quadrotor mode. From the perspective of wind disturbance rejection capability, tailless and X-type layouts are better choices for QFHUAVs. The correctness of results obtained by the proposed method is verified by two flight test schemes. © The Author(s) 2019.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This research sought to identify human factors common among community responders taking an automated external defibrillator (AED) to a victim of an OHCA that are either barriers or enablers of desired behaviour. Methods: A qualitative methodology was used. Community members who had access to an AED and who had been notified of an incident of OHCA near them were approached to participate in the research. Participants completed a written survey and undertook a semi-structured interview. A thematic analysis was undertaken using NVivo software and triangulated against findings from an automated data-mining package, Leximancer. Results: The study found that 100% of people who were notified of the need for an AED responded. Twelve participants subsequently identified during interviews that they held some form of leadership role in their community. First aid training and previous experience of, and competency in managing emergencies were the strongest motivations for their response. Personal risk was not a concern when responding to victims in immediately life-threatening situations. Conclusion: Prospective programmes may be able to be designed to increase the likelihood that community members with AEDs will respond in advance of emergency medical services by targeting common human factors, such as leadership behaviour, training, competency and experience in managing emergencies, leading to better overall survival rates from OHCA. © 2019 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we propose a novel system that uses a deep neural network (DNN) to detect anomalous CAN bus messages. We treat anomaly detection as a cross-domain modelling problem, in which three CAN bus data packets as a group are directly imported into the DNN architecture for parallel training with shared weights. After that, three data packets are represented as three independent feature vectors, which corresponds to three different types of data sequences, namely anchor, positive and negative. The proposed DNN architecture is an embedded triplet loss network that optimizes the distance between the anchor example and the positive example, makes it smaller than the distance between the anchor example and the negative example, and realizes the similarity calculation of samples, which were originally used in face detection. Compared to traditional anomaly detection methods, the proposed method to learn the parameters with shared-weight could improve detection efficiency and detection accuracy. The whole detection system is composed of the front-end and the back-end, which correspond to deep network and triplet loss network, respectively, and are trainable in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technology can make real-time responses to anomalies and attacks to the CAN bus, and significantly improve the detection ratio. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first used for anomaly detection in the in-vehicle CAN bus. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This is in addition to goals for increased Urban Air Mobility (UAM): larger transportation UAS and piloted air vehicles, including air taxi service and innovative aviation designs to revolutionize transportation. A significant problem is the lack of current management systems for this extremely large volume of air traffic, composed of heterogeneous drone shapes, sizes, and onboard equipment capabilities, flying adjacent to larger UAM vehicles in spaces previously unoccupied by General Aviation (GA). Robust and resilient detection, identification, localization, and tracking of sUAS sharing UAM airspace is complicated by urban factors such as non-transmitting, non-cooperative drones. Exacerbating these challenges, current technological limitations and vulnerabilities in Global Positioning System (GPS), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) can pose safety and security threats. To streamline a vision of safe and secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace, we propose Drone Net, a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) network of multi-modal ground and flight instruments. Drone Net is an architecture fusing a network of passive visual and acoustic sensor nodes with active Radio Detection and Ranging (radar) and Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensing methods for UTM, designed for integration with existing Air Traffic Control (ATC) and future UAM systems. The purpose of the Drone Net system is to evaluate use of Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and acoustic arrays networked within an urban UAS operating region such as uncontrolled Class-G and waiver-granted Class-D airspace. The Drone Net approach combines detection, tracking, and localization estimation from radar, ADS-B, and EO/IR such that the design is robust to sensor errors, sample loss, and spoofing or other types of attacks. The system experimental design allows for emulation of corrupted ADS-B, GPS, and INS data on our flight platform including capability to communicate with ground radar and EO/IR to recover from flight instrument major and minor malfunctions such that a Drone Net cooperative UAS can be engineered to be fail-safe and fail-secure. We hypothesize that the Drone Net network of rooftop sensors, shown below, provides this conceptualized fail-safe, fail-secure property based upon the combination of self-localization with backup and confirming data from the ground sensor network. Further, with ground-system sensor fusion as well as UTM flight plan and registration information fusion, the overall system can manage small UAS that are both compliant and non-compliant alongside GA and UAM more safely than a single mode like ADS-B alone. To test our hypothesis, we envision two experiments this year. First, a test to confirm that we can emulate ADS-B, GPS, and INS sensor data corruption, leading to recovery using backup flight (lidar, EO/IR) or ground (radar, EO/IR) data to safely land an ALTA6 or other test UAS. Second, a series of Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) experiments between our test UAS and a tethered aerial obstacle. In the future, we will use this experience with fail-safe, fail-secure methods and software to further test more advanced scenarios between multiple UAS. The network of Drone Net instruments in a local area as well as regional and more global cloud-based networks will allow for heterogeneous information fusion and algorithm development for multi-sensor drone detection, classification, and identification with more accuracy than a single database or sensor system. The latent power of the Drone Net project is in its open-design ground and flight sensor network with data sharing capability to improve data mining and machine learning over time for analysis and security applications. More concrete applications for Drone Net include UTM integration with ATC and UAM, but also airspace safety and security for campus and public venues in general. Herein, we will present our experimental design and current test data from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in collaboration with University of Colorado Boulder toward completing the open specification for ground and flight instruments. We would additionally like to invite others to participate in growing the network and the data available for UTM, UAM, and GA shared airspace research. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The fuzzy-based genetic controller for the car racing simulator TORCS we have defined in previous works is based on two fuzzy sub-controllers, one for deciding on the wheel steering angle and another to set the car target speed at the next simulation tick. They are both optimized by means of an Evolutionary Algorithm, which considers an already tested fitness function focused on the maximization of the average speed during the race and the minimization of the car damage. The noisy environment asks for keeping diversity high during evolution, that is why we have added a Blend Crossover (BLX-α) operator, which is, besides, able to exploit current results at the same time it explores. Additionally, we try to address uncertainty in selection by introducing a novel selection policy of parents based in races, where the individuals are grouped and compete against others in several races, so just the firsts ranked will remain in the population as parents. Several experiments have been conducted, testing the value of the different controllers. The results show that the combination of a dynamic BLX-α crossover operator plus the pole position selection policy clearly beats the rest of approaches. Moreover, in the comparison of this controller with one of the participants of the prestigious international Simulated Car Racing Championship, our autonomous driver obtains much better results than the opponent. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Whilst clinicians classify some of the cardiac arrests as potentially predictable, the majority are difficult to identify even in a post-incident analysis. Changes in some patients’ physiology when analysed in detail can however be predictive of acute deterioration leading to cardiac or respiratory arrests. This paper seeks to exploit the causally-related changing patterns in signals such as heart rate, respiration rate, systolic blood pressure and peripheral cutaneous oxygen saturation to evaluate the predictability of cardiac arrests in critically ill paediatric patients in intensive care. In this paper we report the results of a framework constituting feature space embedding and time series forecasting methods to build an automated prediction system. The results were compared with clinical assessment of predictability. A sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 69% was obtained when the maximum value of Anomaly Index (12) in the 50 min (starting one hour and ending 10 min) before the arrest was considered for the case patients and a random 50 min of data was considered for the control set patients. A positive predictive value of 11% and negative predictive value of 98% was obtained with a prevalence of 5% by our method of prediction. While clinicians predicted 4 out of the 69 cardiac arrests (6%), the prediction system predicted 63 (91%) cardiac arrests.

"ASSESSMENT of EARTHQUAKE-INDUCED DAMAGE LEVEL on BUILDINGS: ANALYSIS of TWO DIFFERENT SURVEY METHODS for A CASE STUDY","2019","International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives","10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-W15-351-2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072210360&doi=10.5194%2fisprs-archives-XLII-2-W15-351-2019&partnerID=40&md5=377c25e0f2a725efcfd1e9745555aa4b","Purpose of this paper is to compare different methods for the assessment of earthquake-induced damage on buildings based on survey data, referring to the case study of Castelluccio di Norcia. The seismic events that occurred in Central Italy in 2016 threatened the future of many villages located along the Apennine ridge straddling the Regions of Umbria, Marche, Abruzzo and Lazio: in Castelluccio di Norcia, a minor historical center in the Municipality of Norcia (Umbria), the earthquake occurred on August the 24th caused some damage on localized buildings, but the strongest seismic event &ndash; the one occurred on October the 30th and with magnitude Mw 6.5, provoked numerous collapses and widespread failure on several buildings of the village, razing to the ground almost the 60&thinsp;% of the built heritage. After the two earthquakes respectively, the Fire Brigade organized a reconnaissance campaign and flew over the village via UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). By acquiring the videos recorded in this framework, that are currently available on the net and originally not recorded for specific survey purposes, the authors produced 3D models of the village allowing to compare the configuration of Castelluccio in the phases pre- and post- the destructive event of 30th October: in fact, since the level of damage after the earthquake of August the 24th was very low, the model resulting from the video recorded after this earthquake could be used as a model showing the layout of the village before the main struck of October. The result of this study is the Damage Degree Evaluation (DDE) and the following definition of a map showing for each building its class of damage, according to the distinction provided by European Macro-seismic Scale EMS98. On the other hand, another damage level map was studied: the Civil Protection requested, immediately after the earthquake and for the management of disaster response activities, the activation of the COPERNICUS project, providing for the detection of most damaged buildings of the village for an early census of the non-safe areas. The map of the damage level produced within this project is of course more accurate and precise, since it was collected through different acquisition systems: UAV, close-range photogrammetry, LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and SLAM (Simultaneous Location and Mapping)-based mapping. This paper proposes a comparison between the two different DDEs, in order to define whether the first method, even if based on data downloaded via the web and therefore at lower resolution, and even if acquired with a more rapid evaluation procedure not providing for ground-based surveys, can lead to the construction of damage level maps that are plausible and realistic. The question is if the first method of DDE, even if less accurate, can allow to obtain results that are satisfactory and useful in the process of management and monitoring of natural hazards, providing support for the several implied institutions, in terms of information on catastrophes and first disaster rescue management. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

Driverless vehicles as taxis are indeed evolving an entirely new transportation concept, Transportation-As-A-Service (TAAS), steered by well-proven client-server infrastructures. Typically, the servers, managed by multinational companies (e.g., Waymo), operate driverless taxis for public transportation, whereas the clients are simply the smartphone-based applications that can be used by customers for one-time registration and booking rides with driverless taxis anytime anywhere. In this paper, we perform a perspective study towards secure and usable biometric-based rider authentication schemes for driverless taxis. Our study is complemented by an online survey that comprises 75 responses from participants, worldwide. We published the survey on social media platforms like Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, and various public transport users groups to collect public poll for rider authentication for driverless taxis. Approximately, 90% of the overall participants in our survey either strongly agreed or agreed with the necessity to deploy biometric-based rider authentication for driverless taxis.

However, to date there has been little systematic study of how drones are being used for health surveillance and management, particularly in resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we draw on a number of case studies to explore how the biomedical drone is contributing to a re-spatialization of health and to a process of datafication that is set to fundamentally change the nature and scope of health governance. The promotion of the drone as a solution to global challenges reflects a broader techno-optimism. However, drones and the cybernetworks they rely on are short-circuiting terrestrial systems and driving a strategic, hotspot approach to health. This targeted view of the world, we argue, recapitulates and extends earlier forms of colonial surveillance and intervention premised on security and incipient threat. We develop the notion of ‘anarchitecture’ to describe the formation of these new inverted health landscapes where state infrastructures are entangled with shifting technological networks. In short, we seek to develop a framework for reflecting on the ways in which global health is being reconfigured through the development of remote-sensing technologies and cyberinfrastructures. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, a filter-based secure dynamic pose estimation approach is proposed such that the vehicle pose can be resilient under the possible sensor attacks. Our proposed estimator coincides with the conventional Kalman filter when all sensors on autonomous vehicles are benign. If less than half of the measurement states are compromised by the randomly occurring deception attacks, it still gives stable estimates of the pose states, i.e., an upper bound for the estimation error covariance is guaranteed. The pose estimation results with single and multiple attacks on the testing route validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. © 2019 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In order to assess the pilot's situation awareness status, it is necessary to quantify its first level, known as situation perception. Therefore, in this paper, the SEEV attention allocation algorithm is improved based on the background of human-machine collaboration and a new model for quantifying pilot's situation perception is established based on attention allocation. The eye movement data of subjects is also collected through specific flight simulation experiments and the situation perception of the subjects is quantified in this paper. The final experimental results show that the main information that consumes most of the subjects' attention is the roll and attack angle information, the route map information and the aircraft attitude information which is much easier to be perceived by the subjects.

In New Zealand, this phenomenon is of considerable concern as the area occupied by invasive exotic trees is large and increasing rapidly. Remote sensing methods offer a potential means of identifying and monitoring land infested by these trees, enabling managers to efficiently allocate resources for their control. In this study, we sought to develop methods for remote detection of exotic invasive trees, namely Pinus sylvestris and P. ponderosa. Critically, the study aimed to detect these species prior to the onset of maturity and coning as this is important for preventing further spread. In the study environment in New Zealand's South Island, these species reach maturity and begin bearing cones at a young age. As such, detection of these smaller individuals requires specialist methods and very high-resolution remote sensing data. We examined the efficacy of classifiers developed using two machine learning algorithms with multispectral and laser scanning data collected from two platforms-manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The study focused on a localized conifer invasion originating from a multi-species pine shelter belt in a grassland environment. This environment provided a useful means of defining the detection thresholds of the methods and technologies employed. An extensive field dataset including over 17,000 trees (height range = 1 cm to 476 cm) was used as an independent validation dataset for the detection methods developed. We found that data from both platforms and using both logistic regression and random forests for classification provided highly accurate (kappa < 0.996) detection of invasive conifers. Our analysis showed that the data from both UAV and manned aircraft was useful for detecting trees down to 1 m in height and therefore shorter than 99.3% of the coning individuals in the study dataset. We also explored the relative contribution of both multispectral and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data in the detection of invasive trees through fitting classification models with different combinations of predictors and found that the most useful models included data from both sensors. However, the combination of ALS and multispectral data did not significantly improve classification accuracy. We believe that this was due to the simplistic vegetation and terrain structure in the study site that resulted in uncomplicated separability of invasive conifers from other vegetation. This study provides valuable new knowledge of the efficacy of detecting invasive conifers prior to the onset of coning using high-resolution data from UAV and manned aircraft. This will be an important tool in managing the spread of these important invasive plants. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, a numerical model for describing the cavity and impact load characteristics of a high-speed water-entry AUV is established. The simulation results such as cavity shape and impact load are compared with experimental data. The good agreement between the numerical results and those of the experiments reveals the accuracy and capability of the numerical algorithm. Subsequently, the arbitrary Lagrange-Euler (ALE)numerical algorithm is used to simulate and analyse the variation laws of the cavity characteristics and impact loads with different head shapes, water-entry velocities, water-entry angles and angles of attack.

Furthermore, by adopting data-driven adaptive dynamic programming and an iterative learning scheme, the shared steering controller is studied from the measurable data of the driver and the vehicle.

The attention is here focused on vision-based approaches. An innovative sensing technique is proposed which exploits a Deep Learning (DL) network as the main processing block of the detector algorithm, and a multi-temporal strategy for track generation and confirmation. Both the detection and tracking phases foresee ad-hoc solutions to deal with the presence of intruders either above or below the horizon. Two customized small quadcopters, equipped with high-resolution color cameras, are used to reproduce in flight low-altitude, near-collision scenarios characterized by different speed and height above ground, thus being able to act simultaneously as ownship and intruder. Results demonstrate the capability of the DL-based detector to provide maximum declaration range around 300 m and 100 m, above and below the horizon, respectively. The tracker can robustly produce firm track of the intruder while rejecting many false positives, particularly occurring in below-the-horizon scenarios. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

These applications primarily will be available in ultra-dense urban areas, where optical fiber infrastructure is already deployed and will become part of the 5G ecosystem. The further integration of fiber and mobile along with optical wireless technology like visible light communications (VLC) can both enable never thought before use cases and satisfy challenging key performance indicators such as increased number of connected devices, lower energy consumption, and reduced latency. In this context, we introduce the integration of 5G, optical fiber network, and VLC technologies for creating end-to-end connectivity solutions and supporting new use cases in dense urban areas. We describe the network architecture and its functionalities upon the integrated technologies. We also describe and exploit several use cases for highly-dynamic and-densely populated urban areas that can be for the first time simplified by using the proposed integrated solution.

In recent years, privacy invasion events caused by customer drones have been frequently reported. Given such a fact, timely detection of invading drones has become an emerging task. Existing solutions using active radar, video or acoustic sensors are usually too costly (especially for individuals) or exhibit various constraints (e.g., requiring visual line of sight). Recent research on drone detection with passive RF signals provides an opportunity for low-cost deployment of drone detectors on commodity wireless devices. However, the state of the arts in this direction rely on line-of-sight (LOS) RF signals, which makes them only work under very constrained conditions. The support of more common scenarios, i.e., non-line-of-sight (NLOS), is still missing for low-cost solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel detection system for privacy invasion caused by customer drone. Our system is featured with accurate NLOS detection with low-cost hardware (under 50). By exploring and validating the relationship between drone motions and RF signal under the NLOS condition, we find that RF signatures of drones are somewhat 'amplified' by multipaths in NLOS. Based on this observation, we design a two-step solution which first classifies received RSS measurements into LOS and NLOS categories; deep learning is then used to extract the signatures and ultimately detect the drones. Our experimental results show that LOS and NLOS signals can be identified at accuracy rates of 98.4% and 96% respectively. Our drone detection rate for NLOS condition is above 97% with a system implemented using Raspberry PI 3 B+. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Traditional methods for this type of work commonly comprise of engaging building surveyors to undertake a condition assessment which involves a lengthy site inspection to produce a systematic recording of the physical condition of the building elements, including cost estimates of immediate and projected long-term costs of renewal, repair and maintenance of the building. Current asset condition assessment procedures are extensively time consuming, laborious, and expensive and pose health and safety threats to surveyors, particularly at height and roof levels which are di_cult to access. This paper aims at evaluating the application of convolutional neural networks (CNN) towards an automated detection and localisation of key building defects, e.g., mould, deterioration, and stain, from images. The proposed model is based on pre-trained CNN classifier of VGG-16 (later compaired with ResNet-50, and Inception models), with class activation mapping (CAM) for object localisation. The challenges and limitations of the model in real-life applications have been identified. The proposed model has proven to be robust and able to accurately detect and localise building defects.

Biosecurity measures to prevent the establishment of harmful invasive organisms at national points of entry (e.g., airports or shipping ports) are vital to protect forest health. Innovations in pest eradication technologies are being developed based on their efficiencies and effectiveness. However, the question of whether people find them acceptable is rarely considered. In New Zealand, research is underway into the use of highly targeted pesticide spraying using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a novel technology to eradicate pest species that impact forest, food, and fibre sectors. Public approval for such technologies, however, can be a critical aspect for their success. A tool can be technically effective (achieve eradication), but uptake may be impossible if communities do not trust the technology. We developed a method for enabling discussions about the use of UAVs and their acceptability in general before being operationalized for biosecurity. This paper presents an investigation of how ""participatory-design"", an often tactile, visual, and inclusive process of community engagement can improve the acceptance of technology use in the public sphere. We asked people, both scientists and citizens, to evaluate the acceptability of a range of UAV uses (including biosecurity) along a continuum and then explored the reasons for their placement. Key criteria for acceptable and unacceptable uses were subsequently developed to help technology designers and operators consider aspects of social acceptability during design processes. Our tool and approach facilitated discussions around technology acceptability that were subsequently adopted by our technical design team for the development and the use of acceptable UAVs for biosecurity. This research shows how systematic approaches to design can help uncover and mitigate social acceptability issues through inclusive design under increasing threats of biosecurity, whether related to challenges of trade or climate change. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, conventional topography and remote sensing methods pose several challenges. Fieldwork in remote areas could be insecure or be hard to conduct due to physical barriers. Remote sensing satellite images, in turn, may lack the temporal resolution for monitoring topography changes or be covered by clouds and shadows that reduce their usefulness. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) provide high-resolution imagery from remote areas and may give a greater insight into land surface changes. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of the Normalized Difference Elevation Index (NDEI), derived from UAV surveys, to map changes in topography in different environments, including a quarry zone of sand mines in Colombia, and in the North Pole Ice Cap. As the NDEI is a metric capable to reveal topography disturbances, it could be exploited for rapid assessments of mass movements occurrence. For this research, a fine temporal resolution dataset of monthly NDEI values were used to explore their utility as a mass wasting identification technique. NDEI was used to map changes in the land surface in a quarry zone affected by landslides and mudflows. NDEI values were obtained from the multi-temporal analysis of digital surface models generated from UAV images and processed using Structure from motion (SfM) techniques. Main components of the proposed method are: (i)UAVbased imagery data capture, (ii)data processing using SfM techniques, (iii)NDEI calculation, and (iv)mass movement identification. Results illustrate the feasibility of using UAV-based imagery data to increase the accuracy of land changes information and produce rapid assessments of mass movements occurrence. Results show that the NDEI approach may increase the accuracy of land surface changes assessment and mapping, as well as enable the design of new methodologies to identify natural hazards and risks. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The successes have generated much interest in artificial intelligence among researchers and members of the public. However, deep learning algorithms generally require very large labelled data sets to work well and large labelled data sets are not always readily available. In addition, most machine learning techniques, including deep learning, often perform well statistically but can fail miserably when, for example, data are deliberately perturbed in an adversarial attack. Another criticism of deep learning techniques is a relative lack of explainability. This paper proposes the use of intentional learning to simultaneously address these issues. Preliminary evaluation on the MNIST data set has shown promising results. Specifically, by combing extensional and intensional learning, it is possible to achieve similar accuracy result as extensional learning only using only one-sixth of the original training data set. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

They are now being used in the industry sector as sensing tools for proactively solving or preventing many issues, besides quantifying production and helping to make decisions. UAVs are a highly consistent technological platform for efficient and cost-effective data collection and event monitoring. The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) sends data from systems that monitor and control the physical world to data processing systems that cloud computing has shown to be important tools for meeting processing requirements. In fog computing, the IoT gateway links different objects to the internet. It can operate as a joint interface for different networks and support different communication protocols. A great deal of effort has been put into developing UAVs and multi-UAV systems. This paper introduces a smart IIoT monitoring and control system based on an unmanned aerial vehicle that uses cloud computing services and exploits fog computing as the bridge between IIoT layers. Its novelty lies in the fact that the UAV is automatically integrated into an industrial control system through an IoT gateway platform, while UAV photos are systematically and instantly computed and analyzed in the cloud. Visual supervision of the plant by drones and cloud services is integrated in real-time into the control loop of the industrial control system. As a proof of concept, the platform was used in a case study in an industrial concrete plant. The results obtained clearly illustrate the feasibility of the proposed platform in providing a reliable and efficient system for UAV remote control to improve product quality and reduce waste.

These data are often produced from imagery using structure-from-motion (SfM) algorithms with or without ground control. While the accuracy of these data products has been assessed in a number of efforts, comparatively little focus has been placed on estimating spatially varying ground-space uncertainties in final data products using rigorous error propagation methodology and uncertainty estimation. Uncertainty estimates of the final 3-D products would provide users a more complete understanding of the quality of the products and therefore the applicability of the product. This paper illustrates an end-to-end workflow, using direct geopositioning and SfM techniques to create 3-D topographic point clouds with rigorously propagated accuracy estimates. Included is a method to quantify uncertainty in dense matching and incorporate those contributions into the final ground covariance. The uncertainty estimates are captured as metadata in the point cloud file using standard formats for exploitation. These estimates are critical to the downstream analysis, exploitation, and fusion of data sets; especially in scenarios where ground truth is not an option. The testing of this end-to-end process is described; data from a field campaign were processed without using mensurated control, and the resultant point clouds were compared to surveyed points to evaluate the predicted accuracy.

Although a comparatively high level of autonomy is anticipated for UA, a reliable data link ('Command and Control', C2-link) will be mandatory for their operation. The C2 link is used to exchange all information between UA and remote pilot, immediately required for operating the UA. This data is called non-payload data; examples are positioning information, telemetry data or flight trajectories, respectively. None of the currently available aeronautical communication standards can fulfill the requirements for such a multi-user, multi-point datalink in terms of reliability, flexibility, data integrity, robustness and latency. The C-Band Digital Aeronautical Communication System (CDACS) is a possible candidate for such a C2 link making use of modern communication techniques like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) and SC-FDMA, [1], [2]. While CDACS development has so far focused on the general requirements and the waveform design, physical layer robustness also known as PHY layer security, e.g. against jamming/spoofing, has not yet been considered yet. One aspect of making CDACS more robust is hardening the login process of a user, in the case of CDACS a UA, into the network against such attacks. This login process is often realized using a Random Access Channel (RACH), that enables users not known to the base station access to the network.

Specifically, autonomous driving systems are extremely complex; they tightly integrate many technologies, including sensing, localization, perception, decision making, as well as the smooth interactions with cloud platforms for high-definition (HD) map generation and data storage. These complexities impose numerous challenges for the design of autonomous driving edge computing systems. First, edge computing systems for autonomous driving need to process an enormous amount of data in real time, and often the incoming data from different sensors are highly heterogeneous. Since autonomous driving edge computing systems are mobile, they often have very strict energy consumption restrictions. Thus, it is imperative to deliver sufficient computing power with reasonable energy consumption, to guarantee the safety of autonomous vehicles, even at high speed. Second, in addition to the edge system design, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) provides redundancy for autonomous driving workloads and alleviates stringent performance and energy constraints on the edge side. With V2X, more research is required to define how vehicles cooperate with each other and the infrastructure. Last, safety cannot be guaranteed when security is compromised. Thus, protecting autonomous driving edge computing systems against attacks at different layers of the sensing and computing stack is of paramount concern. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art approaches in these areas as well as explore potential solutions to address these challenges. © 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

In decision-making layer, a dynamic threat assessment model continuously evaluates the risk associated with collision and destabilisation, and a path planner based on kinematics and dynamics of vehicle system determines a collision-free path when it suddenly encounters emergency scenarios. In motion control layer, a lateral motion controller considering nonlinearity of tyre cornering response and unknown external disturbance is designed using tyre lateral force estimation-based backstepping sliding-mode control to track a collision-free path, and to ensure the robustness and stability of the closed-loop system. Both simulation and experiment results show that the proposed control scheme can effectively perform an emergency collision avoidance manoeuvre while maintaining the stability of autonomous vehicle in different running conditions. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the current standard of care in assessing the presence and quantity of retinal fluid and image-guided treatment management. Deep learning methods have made their impact across medical imaging, and many retinal OCT analysis methods have been proposed. However, it is currently not clear how successful they are in interpreting the retinal fluid on OCT, which is due to the lack of standardized benchmarks. To address this, we organized a challenge RETOUCH in conjunction with MICCAI 2017, with eight teams participating. The challenge consisted of two tasks: fluid detection and fluid segmentation. It featured for the first time: all three retinal fluid types, with annotated images provided by two clinical centers, which were acquired with the three most common OCT device vendors from patients with two different retinal diseases. The analysis revealed that in the detection task, the performance on the automated fluid detection was within the inter-grader variability. However, in the segmentation task, fusing the automated methods produced segmentations that were superior to all individual methods, indicating the need for further improvements in the segmentation performance. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In order to instruct the engineering application with high confidence, uncertainties induced from either systematic measurement or the environment cannot be ignored. This paper investigates the Itô stochastic model of the UAV Swarm system with multiplicative noises. By combining the cooperative kinematic model with a simplified individual dynamic model of fixed-wing-aircraft for the first time, the configuration control model is derived. Considering the uncertainties in actual flight, multiplicative noises are introduced to complete the Itô stochastic model. Following that, the estimator and controller are designed to control the formation. The mean-square uniform boundedness condition of the proposed stochastic system is presented for the closed-loop system. In the simulation, the stochastic robustness analysis and design (SRAD) method is used to optimize the properties of the formation. More importantly, the effectiveness of the proposed model is also verified using real data of five unmanned aircrafts collected in outfield formation flight experiments. © 2019 by the authors.

Methods: Identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing were done using the MALDI-TOF MS and Vitek-2 automated system. Genomic DNA extraction was carried out using the NucliSens easyMAG® (BioMérieux) kits and the DNA was subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS) using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Results: Of the 200 isolates obtained, 37 were identified as K. pneumoniae of which 9 were resistant to all second and third-generation cephalosporins. These 9 isolates selected for further genomic analysis were characterized by the presence of 8 diverse sequence types (STs), capsular polysaccharide serotypes (K types and wzi allelic types) and multiple genes encoding resistance to β-lactams (blaCTX-M-15, blaSHV-11, blaTEM-1B, blaOXA-1), aminoglycosides (aac(3)-IIa, strB, strA, aadA16), fluoroquinolones/quinolones (qnrB66, oqxA, oqxB) and other antibiotic classes. Resistance genes were associated with plasmids, predominantly IncFIB(K) and ColRNAI. Multiple and diverse mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA (S83Y, D87A) and parC (S80I, N304S) in isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC ≥ 4 mg/mL) were found. Global phylogenomic analysis affirmed the diverse clonal clustering and origin of these isolates. Conclusions: The varied clonal clusters and resistome identified in the multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates is a major threat to the management of infections in Ghana. The molecular characterization of antibiotic resistance is thus imperative to inform strategies for containment. © 2019 The Authors","Article","Final","Scopus"

The distribution of the mapping error (realistic-CA - circular-CA) and the computation failures of realistic areas were studied and correlated with the characteristics of the surrounding territory considering attributes related to streets, buildings, and land-use, computing linear correlation coefficients and performing Mann-Whitney U-tests. Results suggest that realistic CAs are not always correctly computable and circular areas are preferable when AEDs are far from the streets in less urbanized and more uniform territories. An automatized decision-making about the best case-by-case mapping technique is therefore feasible with open data and open source software. © 2019.

This agility is in part due to specialized feather systems that function as flow control devices during adverse conditions such as high-angle of attack maneuvers. In this paper, we present an engineered three-dimensional leading-edge device inspired by one of these specialized groups of feathers known as the alula. Wind tunnel results show that, similar to the biological alula, the leading-edge alula-inspired device (LEAD) increases the wing's ability to maintain higher pressure gradients by modifying the near-wall flow. It also generates tip vortices that modify the turbulence on the upper-surface of the wing, delaying flow separation. The effect of the LEAD location and morphology on lift production and wake velocity profile are investigated using force and hot-wire anemometer measurements, respectively. Results show lift improvements up to 32% and 37% under post and deep stall conditions, respectively. Despite the observed drag penalties of up to 39%, the aerodynamic efficiency, defined as the lift-to-drag ratio, is maintained and sometimes improved with the addition of the LEAD to a wing. This is to be expected as the LEAD is a post-stall device, suitable for high angles of attack maneuvers, where maintaining lift production is more critical than drag reduction. The LEAD also accelerates the flow over the wing and reduces the wake velocity deficit, indicating attenuated flow separation. This work presents a detailed experimental investigation of an engineered three dimensional leading-edge device that combines the functionality of traditional two dimensional slats and vortex generators. Such a device can be used to not only extend the flight envelope of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), but to also study the role and function of the biological alula. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The methodology of the study envisaged the ranking of four regions that are fully included in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation by indicator «Innovative products production as a percentage of the total volume of products shipped ». The analysis of innovative activities level of the Russian Arctic in comparison with the average indicators of the country was carried out. It is shown that the Murmansk region is characterized by the highest volume of innovative products produced respectively, the Nenets Autonomous District - by the lowest. The direct impact of the production and sale of innovative products on economic indicators primarily due to an increase in gross regional product (GRP), fixed assets and the number of employed people is shown. In this case the Murmansk region having a high level of innovative activities showed an excess of the values of the Nenets Autonomous District by twelve of the nineteen indicators. In addition by GRP, fixed capital investments, fixed assets wear level and average monetary incomes per capita the Murmansk region showed an excess of average Russian values. It should be noted that the Nenets Autonomous District which produces the smallest amount of innovative products is ahead of the Murmansk region by GRP and investments in fixed assets mainly due to the exploitation of oil and gas resources. Performed correlation analysis confirmed the influence of innovative activities on the economic development of the Arctic. High correlation of the innovative products volume with significant economic indicators is shown.The study confirmed the hypothesis of the influence of innovative activities on the economic indicators of the Arctic regions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, their detection is a very challenging task because of different factors: large variety of breast composition, highly textured breast anatomy, impalpable size of microcalcifications in some cases, as well as inherent low contrast of mammograms. Thus, the need to support the clinicians’ work with an automatic tool. Methods: In this work a three-phases approach for clustered microcalcification detection is presented. Specifically, it is made up of a pre-processing step, aimed at highlighting potentially interesting breast structures, followed by a single microcalcification detection step, based on Hough transform, that is able to grasp the innate characteristic shape of the structures of interest. Finally, a cluster identification step to group microcalcifications is carried out by means of a clustering algorithm able to codify expert domain rules. Results: The detection performance of the proposed method has been evaluated on 364 mammograms of 182 patients obtaining a true positive ratio of 91.78% with 2.87 false positives per image. Conclusions: Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method is able to detect microcalcification clusters in digital mammograms showing performance comparable to different methodologies exploited in the state-of-art approaches, with the advantage that it does not require any training phase and a large set of data. The performance of the proposed approach remains high even for more difficult clinical cases of mammograms of young women having high-density breast tissue thus resulting in a reduced contrast between microcalcifications and surrounding dense tissues. © 2019","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this study, we have estimated a route UAV to follow, using aerial road images. In the experimental setup, for estimation, test, and validation stages, anonymous aerial road videos have been exploited, meaning a special image database was not produced for this simulation approach. In the proposed study, road portion is initially detected. Two methods are utilized to help road detection, which are k-Nearest Neighbor and Hough transformation. To form a decision loop, both results are matched. If they match each other, they are fused using spatial and spectral schemes for the comparison purpose. Once road area is detected, the road type classification is realized by Fuzzy approach. The resultant image is utilized to estimate route, over which the UAV have to fly towards that direction. In the simulation stage, an anonymous video stream previously captured by UAV is experimented to assess the performance of the underlying system for different roads. According to the implementation results, the proposed algorithm has succeeded in finding all the trial roads in the given aerial images, and the proportion of all the estimated road-portion to actual road pixels for all the images is averagely calculated as %95.40.

Taking traffic vehicles' maneuvers into account can greatly expand the beforehand time span for danger awareness. This article presents a maneuver-based strategy to vehicle collision threat assessment. First, a maneuver-based trajectory prediction model (MTPM) is built, in which near-future trajectories of ego vehicle and traffic vehicles are estimated with the combination of vehicle's maneuvers and kinematic models that correspond to every maneuver. The most probable maneuvers of ego vehicle and each traffic vehicles are modelled and inferred via Hidden Markov Models with mixture of Gaussians outputs (GMHMM). Based on the inferred maneuvers, trajectory sets consisting of vehicles' position and motion states are predicted by kinematic models. Subsequently, time to collision (TTC) is calculated in a strategy of employing collision detection at every predicted trajectory instance. For this purpose, safe areas via bounding boxes are applied on every vehicle, and Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) is applied for collision prediction so that TTC can be calculated efficiently and accurately. Finally, a threat level index based on reverse TTC is used to quantize the threat degree of every traffic vehicle potential collision to the ego vehicle. Experimental data collected in the field test are used in the model training, and the overall strategy is validated under PanoSim. An example of the application of the proposed strategy in Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) is also shown. Simulation results show that MTPM can accurately identify maneuvers such that the effective prediction on trajectories can be generated. TTC and threat index can be calculated timely. The proposed threat assessment strategy can not only assist collision avoidance systems to foresee dangerous situations but also eliminate false alarm to a certain extent. © 2019 SAE International.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In view of real time implementation, path planning is complemented by proper cooperative guidance strategies. Planning and guidance approaches are verified in simulations that take into account three-dimensional environment and multi-GNSS constellation coverage.

The approach is based on interval assessment of parameters, use of a knowledge base about critical and state conditions, and application of wavelet analysis. The architecture and realization of an intelligent system for evaluation of the state of complex autonomous technical objects is considered. The carried-out experimental assessment of the offered approach showed that use of wavelet analysis when forming areas of objects' operability allows one to make accurate differentiation of classes of their technical states that increases the accuracy and reliability of state identification and also to expand possibilities of technical means of control and diagnostics. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.

In this work, the mobility and deployment flexibility of UAVs are exploited to form a buffer-aided relaying system assisting terrestrial communication that is blocked. Optimal UAV trajectory design of the UAV-enabled mobile relaying system with a randomly located eavesdropper is investigated from the physical-layer security perspective to improve the overall secrecy rate. Based on the mobility of the UAV relay, a wireless channel model that changes with the trajectory and is exploited for improved secrecy is established. The secrecy rate is maximized by optimizing the discretized trajectory anchor points based on the information causality and UAV mobility constraints. However, the problem is non-convex and therefore difficult to solve. To make the problem tractable, we alternatively optimize the increments of the trajectory anchor points iteratively in a two-dimensional space and decompose the problem into progressive convex approximate problems through the iterative procedure. Convergence of the proposed iterative trajectory optimization technique is proved analytically by the squeeze principle. Simulation results show that finding the optimal trajectory by iteratively updating the displacements is effective and fast converging. It is also shown by the simulation results that the distribution of the eavesdropper location influences the security performance of the system. Specifically, an eavesdropper further away from the destination is beneficial to the system’s overall secrecy rate. Furthermore, it is observed that eavesdropper being further away from the destination also results in shorter trajectories, which implies it being energy-efficient as well. © 2019 by the authors.

It is intended as a replacement for the TLS/TCP stack and will be the basis of HTTP/3, the next official version of the hypertext transfer protocol. As a result, it is likely, in the near future, to carry a substantial fraction of traffic on the Internet. We describe our experience applying a methodology of compositional specification-based testing to QUIC. We develop a formal specification of the wire protocol, and use this specification to generate automated randomized testers for implementations of QUIC. The testers effectively take one role of the QUIC protocol, interacting with the other role to generate full protocol executions, and verifying that the implementations conform to the formal specification. This form of testing generates significantly more diverse stimuli and stronger correctness criteria than interoperability testing, the primary method used to date to validate QUIC and its implementations. As a result, numerous implementation errors have been found. These include some vulnerabilities at the protocol and implementation levels, such as an off-path denial of service scenario and an information leak similar to the ""heartbleed"" vulnerability in OpenSSL. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Large losses of railways in this case require intensifying the fight against these crimes. The point of the research is that for the first time, in order to combat the encroachment on the cargo, it is proposed to create a network of weigh checkpoints (WCP) on the railroad. Such WCP network automatically controls the actual weight of goods in cars along the train without moving them, and compares it with the accompanying data documents for cargo. Then results of the control are transmitted in the direction of train movement via electronic communication. In the case of a discrepancy between the indications of WCP device and the accompanying information about the load, there is a fixed shortage of cargo in the carriage. The optimization of WCP general demand on the railways in practice enables to use the research carried out by law enforcement officers as means for the effectively combat the railway crime. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

These sources generally appear in uncertain and random way as their position and strength are hardly predictable. Several atmospheric factors affect the behavior of thermals (season, time of the day and nature of vegetation on the ground, etc). However, a statistical model of thermals to be encountered can be build. Soaring in a optimal manner while taking advantage of thermals represents thus a stochastic optimization problem that can be solved and implemented in an autonomous glider. The present paper details how to find an optimal trajectory for going through given checkpoints, with the objective of doing as much rounds as possible within a predetermined time. The optimal control of the glider is determined by determining i) whether the glider should climb a thermal with a specific strength when it encounters one, or to cruise, ii) the optimal speed to fly during the cruising phases. The problem is solved using dynamic programming and the proposed optimal path planning strategy is validated by simulation. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

With the advancement of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, and unmanned drones, this challenge becomes even greater. This article explores through empirical evidence the interaction among the three powers that shape cyber intelligence and international security: globalism, regionalism, and nationalism. Recently, world politics has created a sense of urgency concerning the new world order and what that means for cyber security and the domain of cyberspace. With the recent cyberattacks targeting the American political system, the Foreign Ministry of the Czech Republic, the government of Croatia, and the 2017 attacks on the cyber systems operated by the Ukrainian government, there is concern about the stability of global connectedness and the potential for diminution of global boundaries. The concern about global stability raises the question of who controls cyberspace and who is accountable when things go wrong. The aim of the article is to advance a conceptualization for cyber governance frameworks for better control of cyber security by governments, intergovernmental organizations, and the private sector.

The evaluation of the hybrid positioning capabilities implies the physical-layer simulation of observables from both GNSS and 5G technologies. In order to ease the complexity of the resulting system-level simulations, a physical-layer abstraction of GNSS and 5G ranging observables is here proposed. The abstraction of GNSS ranging observables is based on a Gaussian-distributed model of the errors sources, while the abstraction of 5G ranging observables is based on the interpolation of the cumulative density function (CDF) of the ranging errors for certain propagation conditions and signal-to-noise (SNR) levels. Thanks to the exploitation of the proposed physical-layer abstraction, low-complexity system- level simulations are performed to assess the positioning capabilities of GNSS and 5G downlink time-difference of arrival (DL-TDoA) in urban macro-cell (UMa) environments. The simulation results indicate the need to adopt hybrid solutions based on multiple GNSS constellations and 5G DL-TDoA with 100-MHz bandwidth, in order to ensure a horizontal positioning accuracy below 5 m for 95% of cases in outdoor urban environments. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Current approaches for fiber reinforced polymer composites recycling usually not exploit the potential of endless fibers as they are shortened during recycling and will not be properly aligned in the final product. Considering this, the present work aimed at the development of a recycling process for long recycled carbon fibers, where fiber length is preserved and load-related fiber orientation is possible. The starting point for the presented work was so-called slivers, which are long bundles of fibers resulting from a carding process that has been applied to fiber scrap. The main focus of this work was on the development of a binder mesh application rig that processes the sliver to a binder tape, processable in an automated tape laying process, which in turn required modifications to adapt to the novel tape. The functionality of the binder tape manufacturing process was validated with long recycled carbon fibers slivers with linear density of 4 g/m and fiber lengths between 70 and 120 mm. With the binder tape preform manufactured this way, two alternative routes for composite manufacturing were tested. First, the amount of binder was set so high that direct thermoplastic pressing of the preforms was possible. Second, the amount of binder was minimized, and the preforms were infiltrated with a thermoset resin system via resin transfer molding. While the thermoplastic route showed very deficient fiber–matrix adhesion, with the thermoset route, ≈68% of stiffness and ≈31% of strength of virgin fiber-based composites could be achieved in fiber direction in a unidirectional lay-up. © The Author(s) 2018.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, the prediction and quantification of wave runup on embayed beaches is strongly influenced by particular characteristics (e.g., irregular morphology, low tides, absence of swell, etc.) which differ from those on open beaches, and have rarely been investigated in literature. In the present paper, a model framework aimed at predicting wave-induced runup on an embayed sandy beach is validated by means of measurements derived from a video-monitoring station, recently installed in South Italy, during two storm events in 2016. The numerical approach employs MeteOcean forecasted waves within SWAN and SWASH models (in both 2-d and 1-d mode). The combination of multibeam and d-RTK surveys with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery provides high resolution depth grid (0.015m), particularly required in shallow waters, where wave hydrodynamics is highly influenced by the bottom. The results show and discuss the agreement between video measurements and 2-d predictions of runup. A sensitivity analysis of the Manningfls roughness factor is needed in 1-d simulations.

LiDAR data often exhibit severe changes in properties across different observation ranges. In this paper, we explore cross-range adaptation for 3D object detection using LiDAR, i.e., far-range observations are adapted to near-range. This way, far-range detection is optimized for similar performance to near-range one. We adopt a bird-eyes view (BEV) detection framework to perform the proposed model adaptation. Our model adaptation consists of an adversarial global adaptation, and a fine-grained local adaptation. The proposed cross-range adaptation framework is validated on three state-of-the-art LiDAR based object detection networks, and we consistently observe performance improvement on the far-range objects, without adding any auxiliary parameters to the model. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to study cross-range LiDAR adaptation for object detection in point clouds. To demonstrate the generality of the proposed adaptation framework, experiments on more challenging cross-device adaptation are further conducted, and a new LiDAR dataset with high-quality annotated point clouds is released to promote future research. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

We used the information available from the scientific literature on the effects of drones on wildlife and complement it with Internet (YouTube) information to evaluate whether recreational activities using drones produce behavioural responses from wildlife. Scientific papers specifically evaluating the effects of drones on wildlife are scarce but increasing. Nonetheless, we found abundant videos in which many species from different taxonomic groups and multiple countries presented behavioural responses to drone overflights. Furthermore, 26% of the species that were disturbed are included in one of the International Union for Conservation of Nature categories of threat. We found that wildlife that use aerial and terrestrial habitats are more likely to show a behavioural response than those occupying aquatic habitats. The Internet is becoming a source of evidence of disturbances to wildlife that should be considered, particularly for recreational activities. We advocate for the use of technology, but argue that funding and effort should be devoted to evaluating drone impacts on wildlife. We call for educational programmes for laypeople who use drones for recreation and for more research and regulations on their use in sensitive wildlife areas. © 2019 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.","Article","Final","Scopus"

As the commercial industry moves forward with autonomous vehicle research and development, there is a demand for these systems to be able to gauge their 3D surroundings in order to avoid obstacles, and react to threats. This need requires depth estimation systems, and current research in self-driving vehicles now use LIDAR for 3D awareness. However, as LIDAR becomes more prevalent there is the potential for an increased risk of interference between this type of active measurement system on multiple vehicles. Passive methods, on the other hand, do not require the transmission of a signal in order to measure depth. Instead, they estimate the depth by using specific cues in the scene. Previous research, using a Depth from Defocus (DfD) single passive camera system, has shown that an in-focus image and an out-of-focus image can be used to produce a depth measure. This research introduces a new Deep Learning (DL) architecture that is capable of ingesting these image pairs to produce a depth map of the given scene improving both speed and performance over a range of lighting conditions. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art multi-label graph cut algorithms; the new DfD-Net produces a 63.7% and 33.6% improvement in the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) for the darkest and brightest images respectively. In addition to the NRMSE, an image quality metric (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)) was also used to assess the DfD-Net performance. The DfD-Net produced a 3.6% increase (improvement) and a 2.3% reduction (slight decrease) in the SSIM metric for the darkest and brightest images respectively.  © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

So, there are several efforts those are being made to develop and increase the crop yield. In any of crop, weed i.e. (unwanted crops) is the major concern that may leads to poor production of crop. Therefore, an automatic crop monitoring system is required to monitor the weed. This system will help the farmers to monitor the crops, in gradual fashion, once it has been cultivated. Then specific Vegetation Index (VI) would be applied to locate all green portions in the image that would be part of early wheat crop or weed patches. We used Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) algorithm to detect the weed patches in RGB and Multispectral imagery captured by UAV at 30-60 m altitude is used to acquire the images of wheat fields. Once the weed patches successfully identified from between the crop rows and within the crop rows then connected component-based classification technique is used that successfully classify the detected object either the object is related to weed patches or actual crop. The core objective of this work is to lessen the human involvement and to introduce the latest techniques and computation technology, peculiarly to identify the weed patches within the crop rows as well as between the crop rows in wheat field.

Fluid lensing is the first remote sensing technology capable of imaging through ocean waves without distortions in 3D at sub-cm resolutions. Fluid lensing and the purpose-built FluidCam CubeSat instruments have been used to provide refraction-corrected 3D multispectral imagery of shallow marine systems from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Results from repeat 2013 and 2016 airborne fluid lensing campaigns over coral reefs in American Samoa present a promising new tool for monitoring fine-scale ecological dynamics in shallow aquatic systems tens of square kilometers in area. MiDAR is a recently-patented active multispectral remote sensing and optical communications instrument which evolved from FluidCam. MiDAR is being tested on UAVs and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to remotely sense living and non-living structures in light-limited and analog planetary science environments. MiDAR illuminates targets with high-intensity narrowband structured optical radiation to measure an object's spectral reflectance while simultaneously transmitting data. MiDAR is capable of remotely sensing reflectance at fine spatial and temporal scales, with a signal-to-noise ratio 10-103 times higher than passive airborne and spaceborne remote sensing systems, enabling high-framerate multispectral sensing across the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectrum. Preliminary results from a 2018 mission to Guam show encouraging applications of MiDAR to imaging coral from airborne and underwater platforms whilst transmitting data across the air-water interface. Finally, we share NeMO-Net, the Neural Multi-Modal Observation & Training Network for Global Coral Reef Assessment. NeMO-Net is a machine learning technology under development that exploits high-resolution data from FluidCam and MiDAR for augmentation of low-resolution airborne and satellite remote sensing. NeMO-Net is intended to harmonize the growing diversity of 2D and 3D remote sensing with in situ data into a single open-source platform for assessing shallow marine ecosystems globally using active learning for citizen-science based training. Preliminary results from four-class coral classification have an accuracy of 94.4%. Together, these maturing technologies present promising scalable, practical, and cost-efficient innovations that address current observational and technological challenges in optical sensing of marine systems. © Copyright © 2019 Chirayath and Li.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, we particularly study one model of forest fire detection using aerial videos. Different from static images from closed circuit television (CCTV), objects and background in the images captured by always-moving-UAVs are also moving. To overcome this big challenge, two stages of detection are used to enhance the detection rate. Fire-colored pixels are extracted using multi-color feature of fire. Optical flow algorithm is used to examine the motion characteristic of forest fires and extract fire motion pixels from its dynamic background. To combine the results, fire pixels are finally decided using rules.In order to validate the robustness of our model, a large database of videos of forest fires was collected from many sources, videos captured not only by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) but also by helicopters.

In this paper we propose an auction-based mechanism to coordinate the vehicles at a crossing, considering the presence of both human-driven and autonomous vehicles; moreover, we introduce an enhancement mechanism to take into consideration also the presence of vehicles in the lanes behind the first one. We analyze different strategies and, by means of simulation experiments, we compare them and show how waiting times change depending on the strategies.

Autonomous C2 systems typically excel in performance optimization and failure-prevention within known or anticipated environments, but can exhibit poor efficacy given a lack of preemptive knowledge of needs and environments. This paper presents a context-driven decision engine for resilient C2 of engineered systems in emergent operating environments. The solution integrates diagnostic and prognostic heuristics to 1) assess system state of health (SoH) based on operational availability; 2) establish situational awareness; and 3) drive C2 decisions based on scenario-specific constraints and priorities. The solution is applied to an air traffic management problem for autonomous aircraft operations based on a Federal Aviation Administration Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) concept. Agent-based modeling and Monte Carlo simulation are used to evaluate the incident rate (λ) and mission reliability (RM) of the proposed context-based solution against rule-based and utility-based C2 solutions, including the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics DO-185B standard and Dynamic A-star Lite (D∗ Lite) algorithm. Paired t-tests are used to compare approaches based on λ and RM given identical test cases. Results suggest that the proposed context-based solution can concurrently enhance threat avoidance and adaptation capabilities in emergent environments, whereas unilaterally optimized performance is observed via the rule-based and utility-based C2 solutions. © 2019 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In Arizona, such fissures are predominantly found in the central and southeastern regions of the state, where they form in response to subsidence driven by groundwater pumping. Growth and erosion of these fissures often occurs during large monsoon storms, resulting in slumping and collapse of the fissure walls, propagation of the fissure head, as well as the development of gully networks out from the main fissure stem. Fissure initiation and propagation threaten existing infrastructure, can cause property damage, and increase the potential for groundwater contamination from surface pollutants. It is exceedingly important that these hazards be well understood, documented, and monitored. The Arizona Geological Survey (AZGS) founded the earth fissure program in 2007 to systematically identify, map, and monitor earth fissures in Arizona. Data are released through an interactive viewer (https://uagis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/ index.html?id = 98729f76e4644f1093d1c2cd6dabb584), which is regularly updated to show new fissures and growth of existing ones. Additionally, beginning in November 2018, repeated surveys of a series of large earth fissures in Apache Junction, Arizona, (50 km east of Phoenix) have been done using UAV-SfM (unmanned aerial vehicle- structure from motion) to better elucidate the processes controlling the short-term evolution of this geologic hazard. This field trip will take us to two fissure locations in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area. The first will be the Apache Junction earth fissure area, where we will be able to observe the large, dramatic scale of these features, as well as highlight the important role large monsoon storms have on fissure propagation and geomorphological changes. Furthermore, we will show how high-resolution topographic surveys provide a means for significant improvements to current mapping and monitoring efforts for assessing hazards related to earth fissures. The second site will be a fissure location just to the southwest of Apache Junction in Chandler Heights, Arizona, which we refer to as the ""Queen Creek""earth fissure area. At this field-trip stop, we will show how fissure initiation and growth threaten human development, as well as describe the role the AZGS earth fissure program plays in identifying and monitoring these hazards. © 2019 The Geological Society of America.

This potentially leads to undersampling. This study explores the potential of two high-resolution methods for monitoring phytoplankton dynamics: fast repetition rate fluorometry for information on phytoplankton photosynthesis and productivity and automated scanning flow cytometry for information on phytoplankton abundance and community composition. These methods were tested in combination with an underway Ferrybox system during four cruises on the Dutch North Sea in April, May, June, and August 2017. The high-resolution methods were able to visualize both the spatial and temporal variability of the phytoplankton community in the Dutch North Sea. Spectral cluster analysis was applied to objectively interpret the multitude of parameters and visualize potential spatial patterns. This resulted in the identification of biogeographic regions with distinct phytoplankton communities, which varied per cruise. Our results clearly show that the sampling based on fixed stations does not give a good representation of the spatial patterns, showing the added value of underway high-resolution measurements. To fully exploit the potential of the tested high-resolution measurement setup, methodological constraints need further research. Among these constraints are accounting for the diurnal cycle in photophysiological parameters concurrent to the spatial variation, better predictions of the electron requirement for carbon fixation to estimate gross primary productivity, and the identification of more flow cytometer clusters with informative value. Nevertheless, the richness of additional information provided by high-resolution methods can improve existing low-resolution monitoring programs towards a more precise and ecosystemic ecological assessment of the phytoplankton community and productivity. © 2019 Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

Nonetheless, while a great deal has been stated regarding autonomous cars, little attention has been paid to autonomous public transport, more specifically, autonomous buses (ABs). The present report analyzed the psychological barriers preventing the complete implementation of ABs through data collected from focus group (FG) discussions. The main objective of the FGs was to determine the factors influencing perceptions regarding ABs and their acceptability. The most important factors from the positive side were the reduction of personnel costs, the potential to decrease congestion, waiting time at intersections, and reduced emissions. On the other hand, the most important negative factors were an increase in vehicle and infrastructure costs, safety risks under certain conditions (e.g., system failures, terrorist attacks, etc.), and the possible reduction of employment opportunities. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, the movement of the platform will lead to broadening of the ground clutter spectrum, resulting in submergence of potential slow-speed weak targets in the strong ground clutter. To solve this problem, a new space-time adaptive processing (STAP) algorithm based on constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) sample selection techniques is proposed. Firstly, the blocked sample selection strategy in range is utilized to decrease the effect of range-variance. Then, the low threshold CFAR strategy is exploited to eliminate the influence of strong singular scatters and suspected moving targets on training samples, which is useful to improve the accuracy of covariance matrix estimation. Thus, the clutter suppression performance in heterogeneous environment can be enhanced. Finally, the performance of different clutter suppression methods in moving targets detection is analyzed by resorting to the airborne experimental results, which further confirms the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2019, Science Press.

In this paper, we introduce a decentralized, distributed deep learning algorithm for Real-Time Privacy-preserving Target Tracking Re-Identification (RPTT-ReID) used by cooperative UAVs in complex and adversarial environments involving motion, crowded scenes, and varied camera angles. The efficiency of RPTT-ReID makes it amenable to edge computing applications. The proposed algorithmic approach resolves shortfalls with current tracking algorithms, specifically challenges in maintaining tracking when subjects cross paths, switch identity, or are occluded in a frame of view. We demonstrate the power of our approach both in single and multi-UAV scenarios to track movable targets by extracting the facial embedding information in crowds, in order to ensure the privacy of individuals captured by the UAVs without compromising the capability for target re-identification. We validate RPTT-ReID on a challenging video dataset of crowded scenes. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach is capable of tracking and re-identifying people in crowds despite blended trajectories with minimum and maximum accuracy of 79.91 ± 0.2% and 93.27 ± 0.1% respectively. The proposed approach is 18% faster than previous methods for tracking in crowded urban environments. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

As automated classifiers are increasingly used in industrial control systems and machinery, these adversarial errors could grow to be a serious problem. Despite numerous studies over the past few years, the field of adversarial ML is still considered alchemy, with no practical unbroken defenses demonstrated to date, leaving PHM practitioners with few meaningful ways of addressing the problem. We introduce turbidity detection as a practical superset of the adversarial input detection problem, coping with adversarial campaigns rather than statistically invisible one-offs. This perspective is coupled with ROCtheoretic design guidance that prescribes an inexpensive domain adaptation layer at the output of a deep learning model during an attack campaign. The result aims to approximate the Bayes optimal mitigation that ameliorates the detection models degraded health. A proactively reactive type of prognostics is achieved via Monte Carlo simulation of various adversarial campaign scenarios, by sampling from the models own turbidity distribution to quickly deploy the correct mitigation during a real-world campaign. © 2019 Prognostics and Health Management Society.

Automated interpretation of retinal fundus photographs can help support and scale a robust screening program to detect DR. Objective: To prospectively validate the performance of an automated DR system across 2 sites in India. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective observational study was conducted at 2 eye care centers in India (Aravind Eye Hospital and Sankara Nethralaya) and included 3049 patients with diabetes. Data collection and patient enrollment took place between April 2016 and July 2016 at Aravind and May 2016 and April 2017 at Sankara Nethralaya. The model was trained and fixed in March 2016. Interventions: Automated DR grading system compared with manual grading by 1 trained grader and 1 retina specialist from each site. Adjudication by a panel of 3 retinal specialists served as the reference standard in the cases of disagreement. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sensitivity and specificity for moderate or worse DR or referable diabetic macula edema. Results: Of 3049 patients, 1091 (35.8%) were women and the mean (SD) age for patients at Aravind and Sankara Nethralaya was 56.6 (9.0) years and 56.0 (10.0) years, respectively. For moderate or worse DR, the sensitivity and specificity for manual grading by individual nonadjudicator graders ranged from 73.4% to 89.8% and from 83.5% to 98.7%, respectively. The automated DR system's performance was equal to or exceeded manual grading, with an 88.9% sensitivity (95% CI, 85.8-91.5), 92.2% specificity (95% CI, 90.3-93.8), and an area under the curve of 0.963 on the data set from Aravind Eye Hospital and 92.1% sensitivity (95% CI, 90.1-93.8), 95.2% specificity (95% CI, 94.2-96.1), and an area under the curve of 0.980 on the data set from Sankara Nethralaya.

Due to the open-air desorption and ionization processes, random fluctuations of ambient conditions can lead to large variances in mass-spectral signals over time. The mass-spectral data also can be further complicated due to multiple analytes present in the sample, background-ion signals stemming from the desorption/ionization source itself, and other laboratory-specific conditions (e.g., ambient laboratory air, nearby hardware). Thus, background removal and analyte-ion recognition can be quite difficult, particularly in non-targeted analyses. Here, we demonstrate the use of a cross-correlation-based approach to exploit chemical information encoded in the time domain to group/categorize mass-spectral peaks from a single analysis dataset. Ions that originate from ambient (or other) background species were readily flagged and removed from spectra; the result was a decrease in mass-spectral complexity by over 70% due to the removal of these background ions. Meanwhile, analyte ions were differentiated and categorized based on their time-domain profiles. With sufficient mass resolving-power and mass-spectral acquisition rate, isolated mass spectra containing ions from the same species in a sample could be extracted, leading to a reduction in mass-spectral complexity by more than 98% in some cases. The cross-correlation approach was tested with different ionization sources as well as reproducible and irreproducible sample introduction. Software built in-house enabled fully automated data processing, which can be performed within a few seconds. Ultimately, this approach provides an additional dimension of analyte separation in ambient mass-spectrometric analyses with information that is already recorded throughout the analysis.

Onboard software systems have a narrow range of sensor processing and mission replanning capabilities due to the expense and the complexity of these operations, as well as a lack of operator trust in the validity of plans that operators cannot inspect before execution. The advent of machine learning and the maturation of new ideas in automated planning will reduce the cost and difficulty of fielding more autonomous systems, attacking the first difficulty. The second difficulty—that of trust—is severe for underwater robotics, where the more traditional approach of intelligent systems acting as operator aids is made difficult by the physics.

Knowing how birds move within and beyond the region will be paramount to protecting threatened shorebird habitat. To determine stopover behavior during fall migration (2013–2017) in Maine, 180 (104 AHY, 76 HY) Semipalmated Sandpipers, Calidris pusilla, were tracked using VHF radiotelemetry and an extensive array of automated receivers (Motus Wildlife Tracking System). Birds tagged at three locations along the Maine coastline showed no effect of age class or stopover site on body condition (body mass, estimated fat mass) or stopover length (post-capture detection period). However, movement after departure varied greatly among sites. Few birds captured at the northern-most site (“Downeast,” n = 71), which had the greatest amount of mudflats and offshore roost sites and the least amount of human disturbance, were detected beyond the initial tagging location, suggesting that they, like birds in the Bay of Fundy just to the north, initiated trans-oceanic flights from that location. At the Downeast site, leaner birds remained significantly longer than fatter birds, suggesting that time of departure there depended on energy reserves, which would be critical for making extensive flights. In contrast, over half of the birds tagged further south (Popham Beach, n = 59; Rachel Carson NWR, n = 50) were later detected at coastal locations to the north (few) or to the south (most). Stopover period at these sites was independent of fat, suggesting that other factors (e.g., feeding/roosting site availability, human activity) influenced departure decisions. In Maine, Semipalmated Sandpipers, regardless of age, may move north (Downeast) or south (e.g., Cape Cod, Rhode Island, Long Island Sound) where the local topography, habitat characteristics (feeding/roosting sites), and/or lower human activity, may best enable them to initiate trans-oceanic flights to the wintering grounds. Future study should determine if variation in stopover behavior is population-specific and if population-segregation occurs in Maine. Use of automated VHF radiotelemetry has led to a greater understanding of stopover behavior and the degree of connectivity among stopover sites, which should be taken into account for conserving migratory bird habitat across broad spatial scales. © Copyright © 2019 Holberton, Taylor, Tudor, O'Brien, Mittelhauser and Breit.","Article","Final","Scopus"

A thorough understanding of WIFSL formation mechanisms is prerequisite for creating water control measures. In this study, the formation conditions of roof bedding separation, menacing bed separation water and formation conditions of WIFSL were examined. According to the composite beam theory, the traditional criterion for bed separation location is revised. Combining the Winkler foundation beam model, the mechanical model for bed-separation water hazard above the water-flowing fractured zone (WFFZ) was established, and the theoretical discriminant of the first and periodic WIFSL was deduced. In addition, the water inrush coefficient method was used to divide the WIFSL risk. The results of this study show that separation locations are controlled by a combination of lithology, rock thickness, and elastic modulus. The formation of bed separation water is restricted by the separation locations and recharge water source. The formation of WIFSL mainly depends on the strength and thickness of the protective layer, between the bed separation and the WFFZ, and the foundation coefficient of the fractured rock mass in the WFFZ. Taking Shilawusu coal mine, Dongsheng coalfield, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, China as the application examples, the risk of WIFSL within the mining area was predicted and classified.

They cause severe hospital infections, which according to CDC have very high mortality. Polymyxins are universally recognized as the last-line choice against CRAB infections. The role of polymyxin susceptibility testing (ST) for these pathogens remains a subject of debate, although it is critical for selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. There are significant discrepancies between in vitro ST methods and important shortcomings for diffusion and automated methods have been repeatedly verified. The joint CLSI-EUCAST Working Group has recently recommended broth microdilution (BMD) without additives as the reference method for polymyxin ST. Areas covered: This review, focused on this threatening pathogen, summarizes the current available ST methods for polymyxins and discusses the challenges encountered by clinical microbiological laboratories in obtaining and interpreting valid susceptibility results. Studies on polymyxin ST methods for Acinetobacter spp., retrieved from Pubmed database until May 2019, were evaluated. Expert opinion: Currently, no single commercial ST method for polymyxins is providing fully accurate results. Further optimization and standardization of the ST methods and international harmonization of guidelines should be achieved to facilitate the accurate detection of polymyxin-resistant A. baumannii. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Review","Final","Scopus"

On one hand, although cryptographic systems help deal with various attacks, they cannot resolve inside attacks from compromised or malfunctioning ADVs. On the other hand, ADVs with higher automated levels are easier to attack because the automated components onboard are vulnerable to inside attacks. These issues can be mitigated well by trust-based intrusion detection. Therefore,this article presents an efficient trust-based intrusion detection framework for AVNs. First, we propose a novel trust evaluation model for ADVs, in which all the trust evaluation information of a given ADV is utilized to compute its trust value. Then, based on the trust evaluation model, a two-level intrusion detection framework is presented. In the framework, the trustworthiness of an accident or attack warning is established not only based on trust evaluation with the coverage of a roadside unit (RSU), but also the information exchanged between RSUs through the cloud server. Afterward, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based incentive mechanism to stimulate ADVs to report warnings. Through the case study, the proposed framework outperforms the conventional mechanism and can reach a higher warnin. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In such a UAV-aided wireless network, we can exploit the more favorable line-of-sight (LOS) propagation in the UAV-user wireless link to achieve better coverage and higher capacity. Furthermore, the flexible deployment of UAVs makes them ideal for catering to ad hoc demand. Due to the lack of fixed-line backhaul, UAVs act like relays with wireless backhaul links in UAV-aided wireless networks. Unlike the conventional relays in terrestrial wireless networks, the positions of UAV-Rs can be optimized to maximize the system performance. Although the optimal UAV positioning problem has been studied under simple LOS/probabilistic channel models, the joint optimization of UAV positions, user association, and wireless backhaul capacity allocation remains unsolved under realistic channel models, which will be addressed in this paper. The joint optimization problem is a challenging mixed non-convex and combinatorial problem. Combining the block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods, we propose a sparse parallel block SCA algorithm, which can find a near-optimal solution by exploiting the structures of the propagation model. The simulations verify the significant gain of the proposed solution over existing solutions. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

As a part of an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), connected vehicles provide useful information to drivers and the infrastructure to help make safer and more informed decisions. However, vehicle connectivity has made the ITS more vulnerable to security attacks that can endanger vehicle's security as well as driver's safety. Sybil attack is a very common attack, considered dangerous in a distributed network with no centralized authority. When launched against connected vehicles, it consists of controlling a set of vehicles with forged or fake identities to try to alter the measurements and data collected by the ITS, leading to sub-optimal decisions. In this paper, we provide a cloud-based detection scheme for connected vehicles against such an attack. Contrary to the previous distributed solutions in the literature, this paper presents a cloud-based solution that integrates a cloud-based authorization unit to authenticate legitimate nodes using symmetric cryptography and real-time location tracking. As a centralized authentication system, cloud computing is more reliable and secure in managing the vehicle as a device than any other infrastructure in the vehicular network and can provide real-time visibility. A trust evaluation approach is also integrated into the scheme to drive the decisions of the vehicles concerning potential collaborations. The performed experiment and security analysis show the efficacy of our proposed cloud-based solution in terms of detection rate, complexity and system requirements. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are considered as potential reservoirs in hospitals. We performed a retrospective study to estimate the frequencies of Achromobacter spp. HAI among patients from French West Indies, to determine characteristics of infected patients and establish a possible link between CF and infections. Methods: All adults with at least one Achromobacter spp. positive sample and infection criteria in accordance with European official definitions of HAI, hospitalized in University Hospital of Martinique from 2006 to 2016 for more than 48 h, were included. Patient clinical features, immune status and underlying diseases were obtained from medical files. A list of CF patients was given by clinicians. Antibiotic-susceptibility profiles of the strains were determined using an automated method. Results: Mean incidence density was 0.038/1000 days of hospitalization. Achromobacter spp. HAI evolved as an endemic situation with a low but pretty much stable incidence rate over the 11-year observation period. An epidemic peak was noticed in 2013. Among the 66 included patients, 56.1% were immunocompetent and no one had CF. Pneumonia and bacteraemia were the two main HAI. Among the 79 isolated strains, 92.4% were resistant to at least 1 major antibiotic and 16.4% met the definition of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Conclusions: This microorganism, little known in our country because of the scarcity of CF patients, represents a threat for both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients and a therapeutic challenge because of its high resistance. © 2019 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

In CACC, a platoon is formed, where a leading vehicle sends information to regulate the speed of succeeding ""following"" vehicles in the road. In a benign environment, CACC provides tremendous benefits, including reducing fuel consumption, maximizing road capacity, and increasing traffic safety. However, one of the critical security threats in CACC is when a platoon has a compromised leading vehicle, which forges acceleration information sent to the platoon members. Such data falsification attack would lead to traffic instability, high fuel consumption, and potential collisions. As an effort to solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a real-time anomaly detection mechanism using physics laws of kinematics along with data fusion. The proposed technique is applied at each vehicle, where the information received from the leader is validated based on physics laws. To enhance the reliability and support the detection of anomalous behavior, we utilize information sharing in CACC by allowing vehicles and the fixed infrastructure to share sensed information about platoon leaders. In the proposed approach, each vehicle fuses information it receives to reliably detect unexpected deviations. We showed that the proposed approach is effective in detecting acceleration falsification attacks in CACC, and provides high detection accuracy (96%) and negligible false alarm rate. We compare our proposed approach with existing method and showed that the proposed approach provides superior performance in both detection accuracy and execution time. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

From the point of view of the development of new technologies, it seems that everything is possible, for example the bringing of so‐ called”intelligent ships” and “smart ports” into one global system on base of internet of things and big data applications. However, if to look at the matter further, a number of factors and obstacles may appear which could be major threats to the normal functioning of such a system. While it is clear that systems with such high degree of complexity are even technically vulnerable, it seems to the author of this paper that questions that are no less difficult are in the field of human relations. For example, when ships and ports are becoming more and more “smarter” and need less and less people to intervene in their interactions, who at the end will be responsible for everything that can and definitely will happened at sea or in the port? What about liability of cargo carrier if “carrier” is an autonomous ship without any person on‐board during the entire journey? How to ensure cyber security? How to be secured against the risks of so‐called artificial intelligence systemic errors?

This paper aims to propose and compare a fast monocular approach, named ARM-VO, with two state-of-the-art algorithms, LibViso2 and ORB-SLAM2, on Raspberry Pi 3. The approach is a sequential frame-to-frame scheme that extracts a sparse set of well-distributed features and tracks them in upcoming frames using Kanade–Lucas–Tomasi tracker. A robust model selection is used to avoid degenerate cases of fundamental matrix. Scale ambiguity is resolved by incorporating known camera height above ground. The method is open-sourced [https://github.com/zanazakaryaie/ARM-VO] and implemented in ROS mostly using NEON C intrinsics while exploiting the multi-core architecture of the CPU.

Detection of such anomalies is vital for a secured vehicular network. Nevertheless, the attention given for the use of physics of traffic flow to secure vehicular networks is relatively less.

We determined the functional consequences of this variant on the encoded KNa1.1 channel to investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for this disorder. Methods: A retrospective case review of the proband is presented. We performed manual and automated electrophysiologic analyses of the KCNT1-L437F variant expressed heterologously in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in the presence of channel activators/blockers. Results: The KCNT1-L437F variant, identified in a patient with refractory EIEE and status dystonicus, confers a gain-of-function channel phenotype characterized by instantaneous, voltage-dependent activation. Channel openers do not further increase L437F channel function, suggesting maximal activation, whereas channel blockers similarly block wild-type and variant channels. We further demonstrated that KCNT1 current can be measured on a high-throughput automated electrophysiology platform with potential value for future screening of novel and repurposed pharmacotherapies. Interpretation: A novel pathogenic variant in KCNT1 associated with early-onset, medication-refractory epilepsy and dystonia causes gain-of-function with rapid activation kinetics.

However, the benefits of UAV centimeter-scale imagery are still unclear compared to coarser resolution data acquired from satellites or aircrafts. This study aims (i) to propose novel methods for retrieving canopy variables from UAV multispectral observations, and (ii) to investigate to what extent the use of such centimeter-scale imagery makes it possible to improve the estimation of leaf and canopy variables in sugar beet crops (Beta vulgaris L.). Five important structural and biochemical plant traits are considered: green fraction (GF), green area index (GAI), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), as well as canopy chlorophyll (CCC) and nitrogen (CNC) contents. Based on a comprehensive data set encompassing a large variability in canopy structure and biochemistry, the results obtained for every targeted trait demonstrate the superiority of centimeter-resolution methods over two standard remote-sensing approaches (i.e., vegetation indices and PROSAIL inversion) applied to average canopy reflectances. Two variables (denoted GFGREENPIX and VICAB) extracted from the images are shown to play a major role in these performances. GFGREENPIX is the GF estimate obtained by thresholding the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI) image, and is shown to be an accurate and robust (e.g., against variable illumination conditions) proxy of the structure of sugar beet canopies, i.e., GF and GAI. VICAB is the mNDblue index value averaged over the darkest green pixels, and provides critical information on Cab. When exploited within uni- or multivariate empirical models, these two variables improve the GF, GAI, Cab, CCC and CNC estimates obtained with standard approaches, with gains in estimation accuracy of 24, 8, 26, 37 and 8%, respectively. For example, the best CCC estimates (R2 = 0.90) are obtained by multiplying Cab and GAI estimates respectively derived from VICAB and a log-transformed version of GFGREENPIX, log(1-GFGREENPIX). The GFGREENPIX and VICAB variables, which are only accessible from centimeter-scale imagery, contributes to a better identification of the effects of canopy structure and leaf biochemistry, whose influences may be confounded when considering coarser resolution observations. Such results emphasize the strong benefits of centimeter-scale UAV imagery over satellite or airborne remote sensing, and demonstrate the relevance of low-cost multispectral cameras to retrieve a number of plant traits, e.g., for agricultural applications. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Developing defenses against such adversarial attacks is an active research area, with some approaches proposing robust models that are immune to such adversaries, while other techniques attempt to detect such adversarial inputs. In this paper, we present a novel statistical approach for adversarial detection in image classification. Our approach is based on constructing a per-class feature distribution and detecting adversaries based on comparison of features of a test image with the feature distribution of its class. For this purpose, we make use of various statistical distances such as ED (Energy Distance), MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy) for adversarial detection, and analyze the performance of each metric.

When plotted as a function of the inflow advance ratio, the thrust, power and propulsive efficiency plots overlapped for the range of disk angle-of-attacks. Analytical prediction of the performance of the rotor was carried out using blade element theory. Comparisons of the experimental data acquired and the predictions using different inflow models was made. The evaluation showed that the Glauert [15] and Coleman et al.

Performing well at low channel loads, vehicular ad-hoc technologies suffer from performance degradation caused by channel congestion. We propose to apply Multi-RAT diversity to improve the reliability of transmissions by increasing robustness against channel congestion. Multi-RAT diversity is achieved by the redundant use of multiple access technologies in parallel. In this paper, we investigate on the potential reliability improvement by combing IEEE 802.11p and LTE-D2D mode 2. Besides explaining the basic effects and main design aspects, we quantify the potential gain in an example highway platooning scenario based on simulations and concrete requirements. The results show a high potential in the redundant use of IEEE 802.11p and PC5-based ad-hoc technologies. Significant increases in transmission range of up to four times, especially at high vehicle densities and under strict reliability requirements, are achieved. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this regard, visual data are regularly collected in the form of numerous photos or lengthy videos. However, massive amounts of visual data that are being collected from jobsites (e.g., data collection on daily or weekly bases by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, UAVs)has provoked visual data overload as an inevitable problem to face. To address such data overload issue in the construction domain, this paper aims at proposing a new method to automatically retrieve photo-worthy frames containing construction-related contents that are scattered in collected video footages or consecutive images. In the proposed method, the presence of objects of interest (i.e., construction-related contents)in given image frames are recognized by the semantic segmentation, and then scores of the image frames are computed based on the spatial composition of the identified objects. To improve the filtering performance, high-score image frames are further analyzed to estimate their likelihood to be intentionally taken. Case studies in two construction sites have revealed that the accuracy of the proposed method is close-to-human judgment in filtering visual data to retrieve photo-worthy image frames containing construction-related contents. The performance metrics demonstrate around 91% of accuracy in the semantic segmentation, and we observed enhanced human-like judgment in filtering construction visual data comparing to prior works. It is expected that the proposed automated method enables practitioners to assess the as-is status of construction sites efficiently through selective visual data, thereby facilitating data-driven decision making at the right time. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this context, we propose a distributed user-centric risk-aware resource management framework in UAV-assisted PSNs supported by both a static UAV and a mobile UAV. The mobile UAV is entitled to a larger portion of the available spectrum due to its capability and flexibility to re-position itself, and therefore establish better communication channel conditions to the users, compared to the static UAV. However, the potential over-exploitation of the mobile UAV-based communication by the users may lead to the mobile UAV’s failure to serve the users due to the increased levels of interference, consequently introducing risk in the user decisions. To capture this uncertainty, we follow the principles of Prospect Theory and design a user’s prospect-theoretic utility function that reflects user’s risk-aware behavior regarding its transmission power investment to the static and/or mobile UAV-based communication option. A non-cooperative game among the users is formulated, where each user determines its power investment strategy to the two available communication choices in order to maximize its expected prospect-theoretic utility. The existence and uniqueness of a Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE) is proven and the convergence of the users’ strategies to it is shown. An iterative distributed and low-complexity algorithm is introduced to determine the PNE. The performance of the proposed user-centric risk-aware resource management framework in terms of users’ achievable data rate and spectrum utilization, is achieved via modeling and simulation. Furthermore, its superiority and benefits are demonstrated, by comparing its performance against other existing approaches with regards to UAV selection and spectrum utilization. © 2019 by the authors.

However, this activity may represent a risk to the environment, starting from deforestation and ending with production of residues that might contain potentially toxic elements. Tailing deposits from historical mining are an example of waste that may represent an environmental concern when abandoned and exposed to environmental conditions. The town of Nacozari de Garcia, in northwestern Mexico, has three abandoned mine tailings (locally known as tailings I, II, and III) located around the urban area that represent important sources of dust and pollution. Images obtained using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in conjunction with geochemical data are used to assess historic erosion calculation and pollution considering contamination and hazard indexes in tailings II and III. Digital elevation models of abandoned tailings were obtained using photogrammetry with UAV. A total of 37 surficial samples were collected from mine tailings to determine elemental concentrations (As, Cu, Pb, W, Zn) using portable X-ray fluorescence. Higher concentrations were found on samples from mine tailing II. Average concentrations followed the decreasing order of Cu > Zn > W > Pb > As for tailing II, whereas decreasing order of Cu > Zn > W > As > Pb was found for tailing III. Contamination Index (CI) values obtained from tailings II and III represent a low potential of pollution, whereas efflorescent crusts from these tailings represent a high potential of polluting soils and sediments by dust generation. Hazard Average Quotient (HAQ) values on both tailings suggest a very high potential of contamination if fluids infiltrate tailings and interact with surficial water and/or groundwater. Obtained surfaces of mine tailings II and III are 146,216 and 216,689 m2, respectively, which represent around 11% of the urbanized area. A loss mass of 321,675 tons was determined for mine tailing II, whereas 634,062 tons for tailing III, accounting for 0.96 million tons of total eroded mass. Since abandonment, calculated erosion rates of 493 t ha−1 year−1 (tailing II) and 232 t ha−1 year−1 (tailing III) are in agreement with those determined in other mining areas. CI and HAQ indexes provide good estimates of pollution associated with abandoned mine tailings from Nacozari de García. Historic erosion determined in these tailings is an environmental concern since eroded material and polluted water have been incorporated into the Moctezuma River, which feeds several villages, whose major activities include agriculture and livestock raising. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Research into spoofing generation will contribute to assessment of the threat of possible spoofing attacks and help in the development of anti-spoofing methods. However, the recent commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) spoofing generators are expensive and the technology implementation is complicated. To address the above problem and promote the GPS safety-critical applications, a spoofing generator using a vector tracking-based software-defined receiver is proposed in this contribution. The spoofing generator aims to modify the raw signals by cancelling the actual signal component and adding the spoofing signal component. The connections between the spreading code and carrier, and the states of the victim receiver are established through vector tracking. The actual signal can be predicted effectively, and the spoofing signal will be generated with the spoofing trajectory at the same time. The experimental test results show that the spoofing attack signal can effectively mislead the victim receiver to the designed trajectory. Neither the tracking channels nor the positioning observations have abnormal changes during this processing period. The recent anti-spoofing methods cannot detect this internal spoofing easily. The proposed spoofing generator can cover all open-sky satellites with a high quality of concealment. With the superiority of programmability and diversity, it is believed that the proposed method based on an open source software-defined receiver has a great value for anti-spoofing research of different GNSS signals. © 2019 by the authors.

Unlike previous image-based methods which focus on RGB feature extracted from 2D images, our method solves this problem in the reconstructed 3D space in order to exploit 3D contexts explicitly. To this end, we first leverage a stand-alone module to transform the input data from 2D image plane to 3D point clouds space for a better input representation, then we perform the 3D detection using PointNet backbone net to obtain objects' 3D locations, dimensions and orientations. To enhance the discriminative capability of point clouds, we propose a multi-modal feature fusion module to embed the complementary RGB cue into the generated point clouds representation. We argue that it is more effective to infer the 3D bounding boxes from the generated 3D scene space (i.e., X,Y, Z space) compared to the image plane (i.e., R,G,B image plane).

Resident studies are at risk of remaining incomplete. This report describes a process improvement (PI) to optimize survey data collection in a longitudinal research protocol led by family medicine residents. The protocol subject to the process improvement sought to evaluate maternal outcomes in group prenatal care vs traditional care. In the months preceding the PI, the resident researchers noted many surveys were not completed in their intended timeframe or were missing, threatening study validity. We describe a practical case example of the use of a PI tool to resident-led research. METHODS: The residents applied three plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles over 8 months. Throughout the cycles, we solicited barriers and proposed solutions from the research team. Process measures included percentage of surveys completed within 2 weeks of the deadline (“on-time” response rate), and percentage of surveys completed overall. RESULTS: A secure, shared survey tracker was created and optimized during three PDSA cycles to calculate and track survey deadlines automatically upon enrollment in the study. Automated colored flags appeared for due or overdue surveys. On-time response rates did not improve.

However, it can be carried out by only security analysts, which costs considerable time and money. The natural way to deal with the above problem is automated penetration testing, the essential part of which is automated attack planning. Although previous studies have explored various ways to discover attack paths, all of them require perfect network information beforehand, which is contradictory to realistic penetration testing scenarios. To vividly mimic intruders to find all possible attack paths hidden in a network from the perspective of hackers, we propose a network information gain based automated attack planning (NIG-AP) algorithm to achieve autonomous attack path discovery. The algorithm formalizes penetration testing as a Markov decision process and uses network information to obtain the reward, which guides an agent to choose the best response actions to discover hidden attack paths from the intruder’s perspective. Experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm demonstrates substantial improvement in training time and effectiveness when mining attack paths. © 2019, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The most commonly isolated organisms in ICU comprise gram-negative bacilli (GNB), and these represent a leading cause of serious infections. This study was conducted to describe the prevalence of resistance in GNB isolated from patients in adults, pediatric, and neonatal ICU in a tertiary-care hospital in Mérida, Mexico. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was done on samples collected in Neonatal (NICU), Pediatric (PICU) and Adult (AICU) ICU of Unidad Médica de Alta Especialidad, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social in Mérida, México. The identification of isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed using an automated system. Results: A total of 517 GNB strains were isolated. The most common positive culture was bronchial secretions. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the prevalent pathogen in NICU and PICU, whereas Escherichia coli was common in the AICU. Overall, GNB exhibited a high resistance rates for Ampicillin (95.85%), Cefuroxime (84.17%), Piperacillin (82.93%), Cefotaxime (78.07%), Ceftriaxone (77.41%), Aztreonam (75.23%), Cefazolin (75.00%), and Ceftazidime (73.19%). There are significant differences in the resistance rates of GNB from different ICUs for penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones drugs. Escherichia coli (multidrug-resistant [MDR] = 91.57%, highly resistant microorganisms [HRMO] = 90.36%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR = 86.79%, HRMO = 83.02%) exhibited the highest percentage of MDR and HRMO profiles. The prevalence of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing isolates was 83.13% in E. coli, 78.84% in Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 66.67% in Proteus mirabilis, respectively. Conclusions: The high resistance rates to drugs were exhibited by our GNB isolates. Continuous surveillance and control of the use of antimicrobials are urgently needed to reduce the emergence and spreading of MDR, HRMO, and/or ESBL-producing bacilli. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

On account of the inertia, the AUV provides a self-averaging mechanism that erases the high frequency components. Following this line, we processed a high frequency filter on the torques time series. We concluded that the flatfish shape has an excellent capacity of maneuverability under low velocities, showed by its tiny torque variations over time as the inlet speed decreases. We also observe that the pitch component has high torque oscillations over time with drift (also called yaw) angles, showing a significant increment of amplitudes when this angle becomes 10°. This represents an important concern about flatfish maneuverability while, on the other hand, the roll component has shown the lowest oscillations among the three rotational degrees of freedom. The yaw component increases moderately with an increase in attack yaw angles. The description above, especially for low speeds, indicates that the flatfish-shaped AUV presents suitable conditions for missions executing scanning and filming tasks that require good stability and controllable maneuverability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

This is especially relevant for high latitudes where overcast and cloudy days are common. However, multispectral imagery acquired by miniaturized UAS sensors under such conditions tend to present low brightness and dynamic ranges, and high noise levels. Additionally, cloud shadows over space (within one image) and time (across images) are frequent in UAS imagery collected under variable irradiance and result in sensor radiance changes unrelated to the biophysical dynamics at the surface. To exploit the potential of UAS for vegetation mapping, this study proposes methods to obtain robust and repeatable reflectance time series under variable and low irradiance conditions. To improve sensor sensitivity to low irradiance, a radiometric pixel-wise calibration was conducted with a six-channel multispectral camera (mini-MCA6, Tetracam) using an integrating sphere simulating the varying low illumination typical of outdoor conditions at 55oN latitude. The sensor sensitivity was increased by using individual settings for independent channels, obtaining higher signal-to-noise ratios compared to the uniform setting for all image channels. To remove cloud shadows, a multivariate statistical procedure, Tucker tensor decomposition, was applied to reconstruct images using a four-way factorization scheme that takes advantage of spatial, spectral and temporal information simultaneously. The comparison between reconstructed (with Tucker) and original images showed an improvement in cloud shadow removal. Outdoor vicarious reflectance validation showed that with these methods, the multispectral imagery can provide reliable reflectance at sunny conditions with root mean square deviations of around 3%. The proposed methods could be useful for operational multispectral mapping with UAS under low and variable irradiance weather conditions as those prevalent in northern latitudes. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The new generation of aircraft should have the autonomous capable of performing a variety of tasks (such as take-off and landing, cruising, maneuvering, hover, attack, etc.) under a highly variable flight environment (height, Mach number, etc.) and meanwhile maintaining good performance. Morphing aircraft can use smart materials and actuators to autonomously deform the shape according to the changes in flight environment and mission, and always maintain an optimal aerodynamic shape, therefore get flourished developments. Based on the ability of birds to stretch wings when flying at low speed and to constrict wings at high speed, a new bionic morphing UAV has been designed and developed as the study model by our team. In order to make this new aircraft be able to complete rapid autonomous morphing and aerodynamic performance optimization under different missions and flight conditions, we developed deep neural networks and reinforcement learning techniques as a control strategy. Considering the continuity of the state and action spaces for model, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm based on the actor-critic, model-free algorithm was adopted and verified on the classic nonlinear Pendulum model and Cart Pole game. After the feasibility was verified, morphing aircraft model was controlled to complete prescribed deformation using DDPG algorithm.

In these approaches, the idea is to detect automatically threat objects. In baggage inspection, however, a single view is insufficient because there could be occluded parts or intricate projections that cannot be observed with a single view. In order to avoid a misinterpretation based on a single view, we propose the use of single-spectrum multiple X-ray views. Our approach computes a 3D reconstruction using Space Carving, a method that reconstructs a 3D object from its 2D silhouettes (that have been segmented using Geodesic Active Contours). The detection is performed by analyzing 3D features (obtained from the 3D reconstruction). Instead of dual-energy, that is typically used in baggage inspection to analyze the material of the reconstructed objects, we propose simply to use a single-spectrum X-ray system for the detection of threat objects that can be recognized by analyzing the shape, such as handguns. The approach has been successfully tested on X-ray images of travel-bags that contain handguns. In the evaluation of our method, we have used sequences of X-ray images for the 3D reconstruction of objects inside travel-bags, where each sequence consists of 90 X-ray images, we obtained 0.97 in both recall and precision.

Two types of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) are utilized for the two recovery phases to fully exploit DRL's strengths in model-free situations. In the first phase, the angular rates of UAV are attenuated swiftly by a deep Q-network (DQN); in the second phase, the UAV is continuously regulated with a novel algorithm termed LA-DDPG, which is the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) exploring by learning automata (LA). Simulation tests show that the proposed recovery scheme can recover the UAV from flat spin mode to steady level flight with satisfactory performance without relying on accurate prior models or other control structures. Furthermore, LA-DDPG exhibits better stability and efficiency than DDPG. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

It shows that the vortex generators of complex volumic shape, located on the leading edge of a wing, can generate stable longitudinal pattern flow vortices. These vortex structures reach the trailing edge of a wing and disrupt conventional cross-connected vortex pattern that creates hysteresis, generates global flow separation and leads to drag increase, lift and momentum characteristics reduction. Mounting of vortex generators of complex volumic shape on leading-edge slats changes the conventional flow pattern around a wing on the optimally organized longitudinal helical flow pattern that actively affects the hysteresis, increases the critical angle of attack and improves momentum characteristics of vortex flow wing.

To achieve real-time performance in very large-scale environments with massive amounts of training and map data, techniques such as approximate nearest neighbor search (ANN) algorithms are used. While several state-of-the-art variants of quantization and indexing techniques have demonstrated to be efficient in practice, their theoretical memory cost still scales at least linearly with the training data (i.e., O(n) where n is the number of instances in the database), since each data point must be associated with at least one code vector. To address these limitations, in this paper we present a totally new hierarchical encoding approach that enables a sub-linear storage scale. The algorithm exploits the widespread sequential nature of sensor information streams in robotics and autonomous vehicle applications and achieves, both theoretically and experimentally, sub-linear scalability in storage required for a given environment size. Furthermore, the associated query time of our algorithm is also of sub-linear complexity. We benchmark the performance of the proposed algorithm on several real-world benchmark datasets and experimentally validate the theoretical sub-linearity of our approach, while also showing that our approach yields competitive absolute storage performance as well. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In order to compensate for the disturbance of an autonomous driving vehicle, we exploit Deep Neural Network(DNN). It is well-known that we cannot compute the control command that completely compensates for any unmatched disturbance. In vehicle lateral dynamics using a lane keeping system with a look-ahead distance, there always exists the disturbance caused by a curvature of road. Thus, it is inevitable that the lane keeping system only with a feedback control has steady-state error in the lane center on a curved road. To resolve this problem, we utilize the feedback control system with DNN. The proposed method is unique in compensating for the unmatched disturbance in lane keeping system.

Objectively, the use of non-corporate detection systems provides little time for maneuvering, this is why it starts straight after detection. In turn, corporate systems of dynamic threat detection, such as ADS-B, unreasonably expand the area of maneuver beginning. Conditions taking into account speed and angular response data of evader UAV determine the nearest area where the UAV will not avoid a collision. Thus, it is reasonable to introduce the concept of interaction zone, the furthest border of which determines maneuver beginning and the closest one determines impossibility to avoid collision by means of chosen maneuver. The paper considers a complex methodology for calculating the furthest and the closest borders of an interaction zone. The methodology contains numerical methods as well as statistical ones (Monte Carlo technique, for example). It also represents the results of such calculation for speed maneuver, parameters of which are defined basing on the speed approach.

However, an automated vehicle may not be able to avoid all collisions, e.g., collisions caused by other vehicles. Hence, it is important for the system developers to understand the boundary case scenarios where an autonomous vehicle can no longer avoid a collision. In this paper, an automated test generation approach that utilizes Rapidly-exploring Random Trees is presented to explore these boundary scenarios. An important advantage of the approach is the openness of the test scenarios: one can set the road geometry and the number of adversarial objects and let the system search for interesting trajectories and environment parameters. A cost function is proposed which guides the test generation toward almost-avoidable collisions or near-misses. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, the use of debit card or other types of cards during ATM transactions has some problems like prone to ATM skimming, magnetic strips of card getting damaged, manufacturing and transportation cost of cards, longer time to authenticate users etc.The objective of this research is to consider smart phone in Near-Field Communication (NFC) Card Emulation mode as an alternative to ATM cards. In NFC the distance between the respective devices needs to be very small (typically less than 4 cm) which makes NFC ideal for making payments and for other transactions involving sensitive/private data. In the proposed system, in order to authenticate at the ATM kiosk, the user needs to swipe his/her smart phone in front of the NFC reader. An ATM card is not required for authentication and the system will still have a stronger security compared to the system in which ATM card was used. Security analysis and threat modelling shown in this paper highlights the security strength of the system during authentication. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

A robust matching algorithm is proposed to reliably project the selected point in the reference image into the live images of a quadrotor helicopter. Projective transformations are applied to the reference image to extract additional keypoints and to gain invariance to out-of-plane perspective transformations. Since the matching algorithm does not exploit the beneficial characteristics of image sequences and because its processing time is not short enough for high frame rates, a tracking algorithm is introduced. High detection rates even for image sequences with large viewpoint changes are achieved. Therefore, the presented algorithm can be used as input to a guidance algorithm for UAVs. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The proposed architecture takes in the form of two discriminator networks that are trained separately. The first network discriminates between segmentation maps coming either from the SegNet or the ground truth. The second network discriminates between the model uncertainty obtained from SegNet and an ideal solution that does not include uncertainty. The process is very similar to the fusion of sensor information for better decision making. Uncertainty is considered as a measure of mistakes. Hence, learning from it will help improve the performance of neural networks. Our results show that we obtain higher accuracies compared to Bayesian SegNet.

A malicious attacker can not only have a compromised vehicle broadcast spoofed positioning information to nearby vehicles, but also send fake emergency reports to traffic management systems. Previous works on mitigating such malicious behaviors focus on either developing cryptography mechanisms for identity authentication or conducting plausibility checking by individual vehicle to evaluate the trust of messages sent by others. This paper proposes two types of architectures (centralized and distributed) for mitigating malicious behaviors based on the collaboration between trust authorities and vehicles. They differ from previous approaches in that the trust authority and vehicle nodes collaborate but take different responsibilities in plausibility checking and maintaining trust in order to build trust on each vehicle in real-time, rather than only relying on the judgment from each individual vehicle. Also, the trust value maintained by the trust authority in our approach is for revoking certificates of vehicle nodes based on pre-defined patterns of trust changes. The pros and cons of each architecture are evaluated through an experimental simulation. In addition, the proposed architectures for trust-building can be extended in future works to encourage benign behaviors in the long run. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Therefore, efficient strategies for cyber security are in high demand. In this paper, we consider the issue of attack detection in the framework of partially observable discrete event systems modeled by finite automata. We assume that the observation produced by a plant can be corrupted by an intruder which, through one or more attack dictionaries, can change events into different strings. The problem we address is that of detecting if a plant has been attacked and, if such is the case, of identifying the nature of the attack, i.e., which attack dictionaries have been used. We show that the problem of attack detection can be reduced to a classical problem of state estimation or fault diagnosis for a new structure which describes the behavior of the plant under attack. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Therefore, UAVs are increasingly playing an important role in military and civilian fields. Today, UAVs have been exploited to perform special missions carrying some important equipment. However, influenced by the constraints of single UAV's performance and load, it has become a research hotspot that multi-UAVs perform search cooperatively. The process is to minimize the uncertainty of the unknown area and to find the target as much as possible. In terms of cooperation among UAVs, the more effective method based on search map is used. And search process optimization on the basis of distributed model predictive control (DMPC) or traditional swarm intelligence algorithms are adopted, but these methods have some limitations. Due to the behavior of swarm intelligent individual have the characteristics of the decentralization, distribution, and overall self-organization, which match with the requirements of the localization, distribution and robustness of the UAV cooperate search. Nevertheless, the traditional swarm intelligence algorithms have low search efficiency and are easy to fall into local optimum. To solve the problem of repeated search, static targets and low efficiency in cooperative search for multi-UAVs, a method based on improved pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) and Markov chain was proposed. Firstly, a honeycomb environmental model similar to the sensor detect region was established to reduce repeated search for the area. Secondly, Markov chain with the Gaussian distribution was used to represent dynamic movement of targets. Thirdly, Cauchy mutation and Gaussian mutation were introduced into the map and compass operator and the landmark operator of PIO, respectively. Meanwhile, simulated annealing (SA) mechanism was exploited to reserve the worse individual, which effectively reduced the problem that PIO was easy to fall into local optimum. Finally, the algorithm was compared with other swarm intelligence algorithms through simulation experiments. The results show that the new method is effective and available. © All right reserved.","Article","Final","Scopus"

These situations become even more challenging when considering large vehicles, such as buses. We present a path planning framework that addresses the demanding driving task of buses in highly constrained environments, such as urban areas. The approach is formulated as an optimization problem using the road-aligned vehicle model. The road-aligned frame introduces a distortion on the vehicle body and obstacles, motivating the development of novel approximations that capture this distortion. These approximations allow for the formulation of safe and accurate collision avoidance constraints. Unlike other path planning approaches, our method exploits curbs and other sweepable regions, which a bus must often sweep over in order to manage certain maneuvers. Furthermore, it takes full advantage of the particular characteristics of buses, namely the overhangs, an elevated part of the vehicle chassis, that can sweep over curbs.

Therefore, fine autonomous spatial perception capability is essential for ultra-low altitude UAVs with limited loads and computing resources to avoid obstacles. To solve the difficult problem of spatial perception for ultra-low altitude obstacle avoidance, a motion parallax estimation algorithm is proposed by combing the deep learning and the epipolar geometry in this paper. By utilizing the deep neural network, the end-to-end mapping relationship from sequence images to depth values of pixels is constructed for spatial perception.

Despite the great success of the generic object detection methods trained on ground-to-ground images, a huge performance drop is observed when they are directly applied to images captured by UAVs. The unsatisfactory performance is owing to many UAV-specific nuisances, such as varying flying altitudes, adverse weather conditions, dynamically changing viewing angles, etc. Those nuisances constitute a large number of fine-grained domains, across which the detection model has to stay robust. Fortunately, UAVs will record meta-data that depict those varying attributes, which are either freely available along with the UAV images, or can be easily obtained. We propose to utilize those free meta-data in conjunction with associated UAV images to learn domain-robust features via an adversarial training framework dubbed Nuisance Disentangled Feature Transform (NDFT), for the specific challenging problem of object detection in UAV images, achieving a substantial gain in robustness to those nuisances.

Both operations of the simple obstacle and the mixture obstacle are using to prove the method mentioned above. From the results of simulation, we can conclude: (1) The guiding factor can help to avoid both the simple obstacle and the mixture obstacles accurately and to obtain the optimal flight path. (2) Compared with conventional ACS, the calculate efficiency is higher and the local optimization is inexistence under modified ACS. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Connected vehicles (CV) and automated vehicles (AV) are among the most heavily researched and promising automotive technologies to reduce road accidents and improve road efficiency. However, both AV and CV technologies have inherent shortcomings, for example, line of sight sensing limitation of AV sensors and the dependency of high penetration rate for CVs. In this paper we present a cooperative connected intelligent vehicles (CAV) framework. It is motivated by the observation that vehicles are increasingly intelligent with various levels of autonomous functionalities. The vehicles intelligence is boosted by more sensing and computing resources. These sensor and computing resources of CAV vehicles and the transport infrastructure could be shared and exploited. With resource sharing and cooperation CAVs can have comprehensive perception of driving environments, and novel cooperative applications can be developed to improve road safety and efficiency (RSE). The key feature of the cooperative CAV system is the cooperation within and across the key players in the road transport systems and across system layers. For example, the various levels of cooperation include cooperative sensing, cooperative RSE applications and cooperation among the vehicles and among the vehicles and infrastructure. We will present the potentials that could be brought by cooperative CAV, the roadmap for research and development, the preliminary research results and open issues. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To assess the risk for heart diseases, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become the golden standard imaging technique, as it provides to the clinicians stacks of images for analyzing the heart structures, such as the ventricles, and thus to make a diagnosis of the patient's health. The problem is that examination of these stacks, often based on the delineation of heart structures, is tedious and error prone due to inter-and intra-variability among manual delineations. For this reason, the investigation of fully automated methods to support heart segmentation is paramount. Most of the successful methods proposed to solve this problem are based on deep-learning solutions. Especially, encoder-decoder architectures, such as the U-Net [1], have demonstrated to be very effective architectures for medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose to use long-range skip connections on the decoder-part to incorporate multi-context information onto the predicted segmentation masks and also to improve the generalization of the models. In addition, our method obtains smoother segmentations through the combination of feature maps from different stages onto the final prediction layer. We evaluate our approach in the ACDC [2] and LVSC [3] heart segmentation challenges. Experiments performed on both datasets demonstrate that our approach leads to an improvement on both the total Dice score and the Ejection Fraction Correlation, when combined with state-of-the-art encoder-decoder architectures. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In this paper, a comprehensive control and learning framework is proposed to thwart cyber and physical attacks on ACV networks. First, an optimal safe controller for ACVs is derived to maximize the street traffic flow while minimizing the risk of accidents by optimizing the ACV speed and inter-ACV spacing. It is proven that the proposed controller is robust to physical attacks which aim at making ACV systems unstable. Next, two data injection attack (DIA) detection approaches are proposed to address cyber attacks on sensors and their physical impact on the ACV system. The proposed approaches rely on leveraging the stochastic behavior of the sensor readings and on the use of a multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm. It is shown that, collectively, the proposed DIA detection approaches minimize the vulnerability of ACV sensors against cyber attacks while maximizing the ACV system's physical robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal safe controller outperforms the current state of the art controllers by maximizing the robustness of ACVs to physical attacks. The results also show that the proposed DIA detection approaches, compared to Kalman filtering, can improve the security of ACV sensors against cyber attacks and ultimately improve the physical robustness of an ACV system. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This includes advanced technologies in transportation. Among such technologies are driverless cars that pose as perfect models for promising technology engines. These cars have received much attention and appreciation from high-tech companies. Studies have shown that they are statistically much safer than traditional vehicles; however, many issues remain which must be corrected to make the driverless car even more safe and reliable. For example, cyber-attacks on driverless cars are a major safety concern. Like any new technology, innovations of autonomous and unmanned vehicles have led to the emergence of threats of cyber-attacks. Hackers see multiple attack surfaces and believe they can penetrate any targeted vehicle system, steal an owner's personal identity information and compromise the vehicles security. Therefore, driverless car industries must put into place an efficient cybersecurity framework which will effectively counter cyber-attacks on driverless cars. In this study, we propose implementing a cybersecurity policy framework that examines potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities against driverless car systems. Threats and attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities are then identified and analyzed.

Since optical flow is used in several safety-critical applications like self-driving cars, it is important to gain insights into the robustness of those techniques. Recently, it has been shown that adversarial attacks easily fool deep neural networks to misclassify objects. The robustness of optical flow networks to adversarial attacks, however, has not been studied so far. In this paper, we extend adversarial patch attacks to optical flow networks and show that such attacks can compromise their performance. We show that corrupting a small patch of less than 1% of the image size can significantly affect optical flow estimates. Our attacks lead to noisy flow estimates that extend significantly beyond the region of the attack, in many cases even completely erasing the motion of objects in the scene. While networks using an encoder-decoder architecture are very sensitive to these attacks, we found that networks using a spatial pyramid architecture are less affected. We analyse the success and failure of attacking both architectures by visualizing their feature maps and comparing them to classical optical flow techniques which are robust to these attacks. We also demonstrate that such attacks are practical by placing a printed pattern into real scenes. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In order to improve the operational security, fault diagnosis, flight quality assessment and fuel consumption assessment are implemented. However, under different flight states, such as takeoff, climbing, level flight, etc. the possible failures, the meaning of flight quality and fuel consumption levels are different, so flight state recognition is the basis of the above work. Aiming at the problem that the flight time of various flight states is different, which leads to the imbalance of recognition samples, this paper proposes an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) based method. The method supplements samples by generating samples that enjoy the same distribution with the real data, thereby improving the accuracy of the recognition.

The adaptive control strategy has two main objectives: a) trajectory tracking in presence of actuator nonlinearity, b) navigation of the AGV in an obstacle rich environment. However, the proposed controller uses a conventional feedback controller in conjunction with an adaptive inverse dynamics strategy for the actuators. Two different models have been exploited namely Auto-Regressive Exogenous Model (ARX) and Non-Linear Auto-Regressive Exogenous Model (NARX) to identify the AGV's actuator inverse dynamics. The simulation results shows efficacy of the proposed indirect adaptive controllers in comparison to Inverse Dynamic Conventional Feedback Controller (IDCFB).

We presents a complete framework for survey operations: waypoint generation, modelling of forces and tuning the control. In many applications of environmental monitoring, search and exploration, and bathymetric mapping, the vehicle has to traverse in straight lines parallel to each other, ensuring there are no gaps and no redundant coverage. During operations with an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) however, the presence of wind and/or currents produces external forces acting on the vehicle which quite often divert it from its intended path. Similar issues have been encountered during aerial or underwater operations.

Applications range from personal assistants to critical ones such as self-driving cars.

This has a critical impact on the security and reliability of those deployed devices. We introduce novel algorithms to detect the tampering with deployed models, classifiers in particular. In the remote interaction setup we consider, the proposed strategy is to identify markers of the model input space that are likely to change class if the model is attacked, allowing a user to detect a possible tampering.

We experiment those tampering detection algorithms on the canonical MNIST dataset, over three different types of neural nets, and facing five different attacks (trojaning, quantization, fine-tuning, compression and watermarking).

It needs to be able to achieve this task with an error rate similar or lower than a human. Currently, in the automotive industry, most vision based algorithms still rely heavily on the geometry and color of traffic signs to detect and classify them. Although these approaches are suitable for highway scenario where there is not much background objects, they are not robust enough to handle the vast and diverse amount of objects that can be found in urban scenario. Inspired by the performance achieved by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based object detector, we would like to investigate the feasibility of using CNN for the task of traffic sign detection from camera images.In this paper, we will be focusing on two specific issues of our task, the low interclass variation of traffic signs and the small size of the traffic signs in images. To tackle these issues, we propose a new architecture that splits the detection and classification branches of a CNN based object detector. This architecture exploits low level features for classification while it uses high level features for detection in a single forward pass.

In scenarios where denial is potentially hostile, the use of stealth approaches is essential, as it allows such missions to be conducted in the proximity of threatening radars and weapons. We propose a model that allows autonomous UAVs to dynamically and cooperatively reduce their exposure to threats by adopting a stealth policy, in which they turn off their communication radios once a threat is detected. We named this approach of cooperative model as Stealth UAV Networks (SUN). Our model also encompasses control laws for connectivity maintenance, collision avoidance between UAVs, flight path planning, coverage area and robustness to communication failures improvement. We validated the approach with different combinations of control laws, number of UAVs and scenario hostility. The exposure of UAVs to threats decreased by at least 61% and at most 96% when the stealth policy is active, considering all simulation settings.

However, DNNs are found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted inputs aiming to mislead a learner to make incorrect predictions. While several defense and detection approaches are proposed for static image classification, many security-critical tasks use videos as their input and require efficient processing. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective method advIT to detect adversarial frames within videos against different types of attacks based on temporal consistency property of videos. In particular, we apply optical flow estimation to the target and previous frames to generate pseudo frames and evaluate the consistency of the learner output between these pseudo frames and target. High inconsistency indicates that the target frame is adversarial. We conduct extensive experiments on various learning tasks including video semantic segmentation, human pose estimation, object detection, and action recognition, and demonstrate that we can achieve above 95% adversarial frame detection rate. To consider adaptive attackers, we show that even if an adversary has access to the detector and performs a strong adaptive attack based on the state of the art expectation of transformation method, the detection rate stays almost the same. We also tested the transferability among different optical flow estimators and show that it is hard for attackers to attack one and transfer the perturbation to others. In addition, as efficiency is important in video analysis, we show that advIT can achieve real-time detection in about 0.03 - 0.4 seconds. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Knowledge about blind spots helps autonomous vehicles make better decisions, such as avoiding a probable collision risk. It is essentially ill-posed to estimate whether unobservable areas are uniquely assigned as free or occupied spaces. Therefore, our framework is designed to be able to produce probable multi-hypothesis occupancy grid maps (OGM) from a single-frame input based on posterior distribution of blind spot environments. Compared to deterministic single result, each hypothesis OGM can show other probable environments explicitly even in uncertain areas. In order to handle this, we introduce a combination of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and Monte Carlo sampling. Our deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to model an approximate posterior distribution with an adversarial loss and dropout layers. While activating dropout even at inference step, the network generates diverse multi-hypothesis OGMs sampled from the distribution by Monte Carlo sampling. We demonstrate that the proposed method estimates diverse occluded free spaces and obstacles in multi-hypothesis OGMs from either a two-dimensional (2D) range sensor measurement or a monocular camera image.

Trajectory prediction is important to VRU as it is able to predict if the trajectory of other vehicles is a threat or not. Most of the current Trajectory prediction for vehicles involves plotting a relative position of other vehicles with respect to the ego vehicle and this is not possible with just a mobile device. Hence, this paper proposes a method to predict trajectory of other vehicles based on detected vehicles center coordinates. This is achieved using Gaussian Process Auto-Regression based on past data of vehicle center coordinates to predict future coordinates on an x-y pixel plane using only a camera sensor and You Only Look Once (YOLO) vehicle detection. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

An IWSN is composed of multiple distributed resource-constrained sensor nodes, which require their local clocks to be synchronized with each other to exchange packets in a precisely real time ordered schedule. Time synchronization protocols are not outlined with security support. As a consequence, a new generation of attacks arose, explicitly targeting the corresponding protocols. Recent research studies [1, 2, 3] prove that synchronization attacks are severe and practical. Without detection mechanisms, synchronization attacks bypass security defenses. A methodology for the detection of synchronization attacks based on characteristics of the synchronization protocol is proposed in this paper. Thus, we propose a novel method based on machine learning algorithms for detecting IIoT synchronization attacks. Applying such strategies for cyber-security in IIoT requires the availability of substantial synchronization IIoT attack data. In our research, the real-life equivalent simulations using the open source OpenWSN simulator has been utilized for generation of high fidelity attack area, within the 6TiSCH industrial network. We believe that the IIoT attack dataset generated in this work can be used for further research and for detecting high layer attacks too. Experimentation was carried out using six learning algorithms to detect the attack and classify them from legitimate behavior. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, to perform this detection, GNSS-R needs a priori calibration of a threshold on the received reflected power in order to distinguish the presence/no prence of water.

This paper proposes a 3D map optimization framework to generate such map with high efficiency and low memory consumption. First, a deep learning based method is designed to automatically filter out non-map objects in mobile laser scans during mapping.

This paper studies the flight control strategy in the transition mode of tail-mounted VTOL UAV, and proposes a strategy of the fastest transition speed with constant altitude control. Simulation and experiment are used to analyze and compare the flight effect of this strategy, classical proportion-intergration-differentiation(PID) control and the fastest transition speed control. Strategy of the fastest transition speed with constant altitude control optimizes the change of flight speed and altitude, synchronizes the time of cruise attack angle and cruise speed, and maintains the vertical force balance of UAV in the mode transition. The simulation results show that the fastest transition speed with constant altitude control's time decreases by 0.98 and 0.48 s than that of the classical PID control and the fastest transition speed control, while the change of altitude decreases by 2.27 and 0.91 m. The flight control effect of the fastest transition speed with constant altitude control is obviously superior to the classical PID control and the fastest transition speed control. The proposed control strategy solved the problem of large altitude change during the mode transition, and ensured the rapid and steady flight mode transition of UAV in the transition mode. © 2019, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press.

The swept blade design method was used to solve this problem. Five swept blades were designed on the basis of unswept blade, and the sweep angles were 10°,20°,30°,40°, and 50°. Three dimensional Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes(RANS) equations were solved based on periodic boundary condition, and multiple reference frames(MRF) model was employed to simulate the aerodynamic properties of unswept and swept blades. According to the results, the reason why the efficiency of propeller drops rapidly after design point was discussed firstly, and then the thrust, power and efficiency of different blades were compared. Moreover, the influence of swept design of blades was discussed through comparing the pressure distribution on each blade. The results show that the decreasing attack angle of blade with the increasing of flight speed as well as the tip compression effect of blade lead to the rapidly dropping efficiency of propeller after design point. The decreasing attack angle of blade can be avoided by changing the propeller rotational speed according to the changing of flight speed, however, the tip compression effect of blade always effected the propeller performance negatively no matter what the advance ratio is. The comparison of the thrust, power and efficiency between different sweep angles show that, the swept blade can provide higher thrust but need more power, and the high-speed performance of propeller is satisfactory when the sweep angle is between 30° and 50°. The comparison of the pressure distribution between different sweep angles shows that the performance of swept blades is influenced by the changed attack angle and the three-dimensional tip effect of the blade. The comparison of the tip pressure distribution between swept and unswept blades shows that the strength of the tip shock wave can be reduced by the swept blade method, but the interference of the shock wave/boundary layer contributes to the strength. In conclusion, the swept blade design method can reduce the impact of the tip compression effect on propeller, but the swept blade performance is influenced by the changed blade attack angle, the three-dimensional blade tip effect, the strength of the tip shock wave, and the shock wave/boundary layer interation. © 2019, The Editorial Board of Acta Aerodynamica Sinica.

However, the domain invariance knowledge is seldom taken into consideration. In this paper, we proposed an Adversarial Self-Training (AST) framework with the observation of the generated pseudo-labels holding the class-balanced intrinsic domain invariance that can be integrated into both output-space and adversarial-space (i.e., the output space of the discriminator network). Furthermore, we separate the modulation of Batch Normalization (BN) layers from training, in order to concentrate the task of adversarial learning and elevate the quality of pseudo-labels.

To conduct collocated oceanographic observations with this heterogeneous mix of unmanned assets, autonomy routines were developed to predict Slocum Glider surfacing locations and plan a Wave Glider path that minimized geographic separation between the two platforms. Prediction and planning engines are tuned to the unique performance characteristics of each platform. To ensure survivability of the Wave Glider in the extreme seas present at our study site, autonomy was developed to switch the Wave Glider control between mission objectives and platform survivability. The best estimate of a Slocum Glider's path during a flight segment is based on commanded and measured information from the Slocum Glider just before diving: average speed over ground (SOG), desired heading, depth averaged current (DAC), and the duration of the dive profile. For the Slocum, the DAC is computed from the offset between the expected and actual surfacing location during the previous dive, divided by the segment duration. This time-invariant treatment of the ocean current structure is found to be inadequate to accurately predict vehicle surfacing locations in regions where tidally-driven or other rapidly time-evolving flow patterns dominate. An improved model for predicting Slocum Glider trajectories in the Iceland Basin that incorporates real-time current measurements from a Wave Glider-mounted acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) and a short-term predictive tidal model is used to improve the estimate of depth average current. This capability is unique in that no additional information is explicitly exchanged between the vehicles (say from an acoustic modem).

This problem is aggravated when the traffic is predominantly composed of smaller vehicles that frequently disobey lane behavior as is the case in many developing countries. Existing macro approaches consider the trajectory prediction problem for lane-based traffic that cannot account when there is a high disparity in vehicle size and driving behavior among different vehicle types. Hence, we propose a vehicle trajectory prediction approach that models the interaction among different types of vehicles with vastly different driving styles. These interactions are encapsulated in the form of a social context embedded in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to predict the trajectory of each vehicle at either a signalized or non-signalized intersection. The GAN model produces the most acceptable future trajectory among many choices that conform to past driving behavior as well as the trajectories of neighboring vehicles. We evaluate the proposed approach on aerial videos of intersections recorded in China where lane discipline is not followed by vehicles.

In order to achieve the control of diseases and efficiency of the pesticide application, a pesticide deposition must reach destination target at maximum quantity.

They have been used in many military and civilian applications. Emergency communication is one of the essential requirements for first responders and victims in the aftermath of natural disasters. In such scenarios, UAVs may configure ad hoc wireless networks to cover a large area. In UAV networks, however, localization and routing are challenging tasks owing to the high mobility, unstable links, dynamic topology, and limited energy of UAVs. Here, we propose swarm-intelligence-based localization (SIL) and clustering schemes in UAV networks for emergency communications. First, we propose a new 3-D SIL algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that exploits the particle search space in a limited boundary by using the bounding box method. In the 3-D search space, anchor UAV nodes are randomly distributed and the SIL algorithm measures the distance to existing anchor nodes for estimating the location of the target UAV nodes. Convergence time and localization accuracy are improved with lower computational cost. Second, we propose an energy-efficient swarm-intelligence-based clustering (SIC) algorithm based on PSO, in which the particle fitness function is exploited for intercluster distance, intracluster distance, residual energy, and geographic location. For energy-efficient clustering, cluster heads are selected based on improved particle optimization.

Where once the operation of these platforms was limited to skilled individuals, increased computational power, manufacturing techniques, and increased autonomy allows inexperienced individuals to skillfully maneuver these devices. With this rise in consumer use of UAS comes an increased security concern regarding their use for malicious intent.The focus area of counter UAS (CUAS) remains a challenging space due to a small cross-sectioned UAS's ability to move in all three dimensions, attain very high speeds, carry payloads of notable weight, and avoid standard delay techniques.We examine frequency analysis of pixel fluctuation over time to exploit the temporal frequency signature present in UAS imagery. This signature allows for lower pixels-on-target detection [1]. The methodology also acts as a method of assessment due to the distinct frequency signatures of UAS when examined against the standard nuisance alarms such as birds. The temporal frequency analysis (TFA) method demonstrates a UAS detection and assessment method. In this paper we discuss signal processing and Fourier filter optimization methodologies that increase UAS contrast. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In particular, the use of artificial intelligence can cause unpredictable behavior when encountering situations that were not included in the training data. We describe an alternative to static analysis and conventional testing that monitors and enforces formally specified properties describing a system's physical state. All external inputs and outputs are monitored by multiple parallel automata synthesized from guards specified as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas capturing application-specific correctness, safety, and liveness properties. Unlike conventional runtime verification, adding guards does not impact application software performance since the monitor automata are implemented in configurable hardware. In order to remove all dependencies on software, input/output controllers and drivers may also be implemented in configurable hardware. A reporting or corrective action may be taken when a guard is triggered. This architecture is consistent with the guidance prescribed in ASTM F3269-17, Methods to Safely Bound Behavior of Unmanned Aircraft Systems Containing Complex Functions. The monitor and input/output subsystem's minimal and isolated implementations are amenable to model checking since all components are independent finite state machines. Because this approach makes no assumptions about the root cause of deviation from specifications, it can detect and mitigate: malware threats; sensor and network attacks; software bugs; sensor, actuator and communication faults; and inadvertent or malicious operator errors. We demonstrate this approach with rules defining a virtual cage for a commercially available drone. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Anthropogenically altered environments can subsidize certain species, causing them to become overabundant and straining the remaining natural system. Such is the case with the widespread avian generalist and subsidized predator, the common raven (Corvus corax). Ravens depredate nests and prey on small animals, with locally focused high impacts to the ecosystem during rearing of their nestlings. Limiting predator abundance reduces the spatially concentrated predation rates by eliminating nestling provisioning needs. We investigated avenues to limit the reproduction of common raven using customized theoretical and practical tools. Specifically, we developed an online interactive tool, a mathematical model, that calculates the predator's population growth rate under any given proportion of reproductive management. This quantitative tool models an assessment of ravens in a defined area and results in the degree to which raven fitness would need to be reduced to control their populations. To implement the model's results in a field-practical way and manage reproduction with minimal disturbance, we developed novel technology, a Remote Fluid Application System (RFAS). The RFAS applies the egg addling technique of egg oiling to high (usually out of reach) nesting situations. We tested these tools in the Mojave Desert, CA, where the raven is a heavily human-subsidized predator. We mounted our RFAS on telescoping poles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; drones) and found that we were able to aerially, and precisely, spray-oil eggs high in trees or cliffs/rock faces, halting 100% (n = 46) of raven nesting events. With these tools, we enable managers to calculate the intensity of, and the ability to carry out, egg addling needed to stem or halt predator population growth. We conclude that the combination of the interactive software (StallPOPd Interactive Tool, https://cwhl.vet.cornell.edu/tools/stallpopd; publicly available at https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/65718) and the RFAS is the most effective wildlife management strategy to date for the offset or control of undesirable population growth in high-nesting avian predators. © 2019 The Authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It permits the easy creation of centralized knowledge bases, thus straightforwardly enabling that multiple embedded systems (such as sensor or control devices) can have a collaborative, shared intelligence. In addition to this, thanks to its vast computing power, complex tasks can be done over low-spec devices just by offloading computation to the cloud, with the additional advantage of saving energy. In this work, cloud’s capabilities are exploited to implement and test a cloud-based surveillance system. Using a shared, 3D symbolic world model, different devices have a complete knowledge of all the elements, people and intruders in a certain open area or inside a building. The implementation of a volumetric, 3D, object-oriented, cloud-based world model (including semantic information) is novel as far as we know. Very simple devices (orange Pi) can send RGBD streams (using kinect cameras) to the cloud, where all the processing is distributed and done thanks to its inherent scalability. A proof-of-concept experiment is done in this paper in a testing lab with multiple cameras connected to the cloud with 802.11ac wireless technology. Our results show that this kind of surveillance system is possible currently, and that trends indicate that it can be improved at a short term to produce high performance vigilance system using low-speed devices. In addition, this proof-of-concept claims that many interesting opportunities and challenges arise, for example, when mobile watch robots and fixed cameras would act as a team for carrying out complex collaborative surveillance strategies. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Through structure from motion (SfM) and multi-view-stereo (MVS) techniques, aerial imagery can provide a low-cost alternative compared to bathymetric LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) surveys, as it offers additional important visual information and higher spatial resolution. Nevertheless, water refraction poses significant challenges on depth determination. Till now, this problem has been addressed through customized image-based refraction correction algorithms or by modifying the collinearity equation. In this article, in order to overcome the water refraction errors in a massive and accurate way, we employ machine learning tools, which are able to learn the systematic underestimation of the estimated depths. In particular, an SVR (support vector regression) model was developed, based on known depth observations from bathymetric LiDAR surveys, which is able to accurately recover bathymetry from point clouds derived from SfM-MVS procedures. Experimental results and validation were based on datasets derived from different test-sites, and demonstrated the high potential of our approach.

Due to their size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints, most modern MAVs use miniaturized inertial measurement units (IMUs) to provide attitude feedback, which is critical for flight stabilization and control. However, recent adversarial attack studies have demonstrated that many commonly used IMUs are vulnerable to attacks exploiting their physical characteristics. Conventional redundancy-based approaches are not effective against such attacks because redundant IMUs have the same or similar physical vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present a novel fault-tolerant solution for IMU compromised scenarios, using separate position and heading information to restore the failed attitude states. Rather than adding more IMU alternatives for recovery, the proposed method is intended to minimize any modifications to the existing system and control program. Thus, it is particularly useful for vehicles that have tight SWaP constraints while requiring simultaneous high performance and safety demands. To execute the recovery logic properly, a robust estimator was designed for fine-grained detection and isolation of the faulty sensors. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was validated on a quadcopter MAV through both simulation and experimental flight tests. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

FPGA-based DNN accelerators have demonstrated both superior flexibility and performance; in addition, for real-time inference with low batch size, FPGA is expected to achieve further performance improvement. However, the performance gain from the single-FPGA design is obstructed by the limited on-chip resource. In this paper, we employ multiple FPGAs to cooperatively run DNNs with the objective of achieving super-linear speed-up against single-FPGA design. In implementing such systems, we found two barriers that hinder us from achieving the design goal: (1) the lack of a clear partition scheme for each DNN layer to fully exploit parallelism, and (2) the insufficient bandwidth between the off-chip memory and the accelerator due to the growing size of DNNs. To tackle these issues, we propose a general framework, “Super-LIP”, which can support different kinds of DNNs. In this paper, we take Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a vehicle to illustrate Super-LIP. We first formulate an accurate system-level model to support the exploration of best partition schemes. Then, we develop a novel design methodology to effectively alleviate the heavy loads on memory bandwidth by moving traffic from memory bus to inter-FPGA links. We implement Super-LIP based on ZCU102 FPGA boards. Results demonstrate that Super-LIP with 2 FPGAs can achieve 3.48× speedup, compared to the state-of-the-art single-FPGA design. What is more, as the number of FPGAs scales up, the system latency can be further reduced while maintaining high energy efficiency. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This paper studies a multivariable adaptive control based consensus flight method for UAVs formation. A majority of existing research is focused on the leader-following consensus problem assuming that only the parameters of followers are uncertain. However, they do not consider the leader dynamic uncertainty and the unknown external disturbances. Therefore, this paper addresses the problem of the UAVs consensus flight control with parametric uncertainties and unknown external disturbances for both the leader and follower. A multivariable model reference adaptive control (MRAC) based consensus flight control scheme is designed for UAVs formation, which enables the follower UAV to track the leader UAV. The stability of the multivariable MRAC based consensus flight control system is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed adaptive consensus flight control scheme has stronger robustness and adaptivity than the fixed control scheme. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Article","Final","Scopus"

Specifically, in the context of semiautonomous driving, studies have revealed that correct and timely prediction of the driver's intention needs to be an essential part of Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) design. To this end, we propose a framework that exploits drivers' time-series eye gaze and fixation patterns to anticipate their real-time intention over possible future manoeuvres, enabling a smart and collaborative ADAS that can aid drivers to overcome safety-critical situations. The method models human intention as the latent states of a hidden Markov model and uses probabilistic dynamic time warping distributions to capture the temporal characteristics of the observation patterns of the drivers. The method is evaluated on a data set of 124 experiments from 75 drivers collected in a safety-critical semi-autonomous driving scenario. The results illustrate the efficacy of the framework by correctly anticipating the drivers' intentions about 3 seconds beforehand with over 90% accuracy. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Widely accepted workflows are based on bottom-up mass spectrometry, and they often require multiple techniques and significant manual work. Here, we demonstrate that optimization of a set of tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS) collision energies and automated combination of all available information in the measurements can increase the sequence validated by one technique close to the inherent limits. We created a software (called ""Serac"") that consumes results of the Mascot database search engine and identifies the amino acids validated by bottom-up MS/MS experiments using the most rigorous, industrially acceptable definition of sequence coverage (we term this ""confirmed sequence coverage""). The software can combine spectra at the level of amino acids or fragment ions to exploit complementarity, provides full transparency to justify validation, and reduces manual effort. With its help, we investigated collision energy dependence of confirmed sequence coverage of individual peptides and full proteins on trypsin-digested monoclonal antibody samples (rituximab and trastuzumab). We found the energy dependence to be modest, but we demonstrated the benefit of using spectra taken at multiple energies. We describe a workflow based on 2-3 LC-MS/MS runs, carefully selected collision energies, and a fragment ion level combination, which yields ∼85% confirmed sequence coverage, 25%-30% above that from a basic proteomics protocol. Further increase can mainly be expected from alternative digestion enzymes or fragmentation techniques, which can be seamlessly integrated to the processing, thereby allowing effortless validation of full sequences. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Article","Final","Scopus"

BAC, easily detectable on mammograms, are associated with CV disease and represent a potential imaging biomarker for CV disease prevention in women. Method: We summarized the available evidence on this topic. Results: Age, parity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia were found to positively correlate with BAC. Women with BAC have a higher CV risk than those without BAC: the relative risk was reported to be 1.4 for transient ischemic attack/stroke, 1.5 for thrombosis, 1.8 for myocardial infarction; the reported hazard ratio was 1.32 for coronary artery disease (CAD), 1.52 for heart failure, 1.29 for CV death, 1.44 for death from CAD. However, BAC do not alarm radiologists; when reported, they are commonly mentioned as “present”, not impacting on CV decision-making. Of 18 published studies, 9 reported only presence/absence of BAC, 4 used a semi-quantitative scale, and 5 a continuous scale (with manual, automatic or semiautomatic segmentation). Various appearance, topological complexity, and vessels overlap make BAC quantification difficult to standardize. Nevertheless, machine learning approaches showed promising results in BAC quantification on mammograms. Conclusions: There is a strong rationale for mammography to become a dual test for breast cancer screening and CV disease prevention. However, robust and automated quantification methods are needed for a deeper insight on the association between BAC and CV disease, to stratifying CV risk and define personalized preventive actions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Review","Final","Scopus"

We claim that the successful adoption of AV in future transport systems will be achieved by reasonable risk management approaches that deal with different potential threats of cybersecurity. This survey produced usable responses from 204 participants. The significant result was that the respondents had not previously heard of vehicle-related technology; however, most had a positive first opinion on technology. Around 85% of participants felt that the expected benefits were likely to occur. They expressed a high level of concern regarding security and performance issues. Respondents stated that safety is the most crucial aspect of driverless vehicles. Mostly, it stated that personal communication devices should integrate with the AV's internet connection.

The paper briefly describes the different attacks that can affect to the operation of UAVs and the security methods that, nowadays, are used to guarantee the security during the operations. Moreover, it presents a solution to a strong vulnerability detected in the classical scheme used in UAV. This scheme uses ROS (Robot Operating System) as the core of the communication system to interconnect different devices and nodes in this paper, it is demonstrated that if an Intruder is able to enter in the local network of the UAV system, he/she is also able to impersonate the GCS (Ground Control Station) of the UAV and take control of it leading to an undesirable maneuver or even a dangerous crash against a building or a person. The security system proposed to avoid this consists of a simplified method based on ECIES sending packets, between UAV and GCS, which uses ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature) and are ciphered in RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman). Thus, it is possible to guarantee that the high level computer of the UAV is able to identify the identity of their GCS and prevent of being commanded by an unauthorized Intruder.

Thus, they are under the risk of being victims of exploitation, violence and attacks. In addition, they may find themselves unintendedly insulting their friends, relatives or caregivers. In this paper, we propose an autonomous agent to assist the special needs person (child or adult) in the goal of recognizing risky or insulting situations. The autonomous agent will detect these situations and will signal them to the user (by text, speech, or other signaling forms). We composed a dataset containing 13,490 sentences, categorized into one of four classes: A 'normal' sentence, an insulting sentence, a negative sentence about a different person, or a risky sentence that may indicate a dangerous situation for the special needs person, which requires immediate intervention. We used several machine learning methods, and we found that the most accurate methods were the random forest method with 100 estimators, a voting method using several classifiers, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) with embedding. All of these mechanisms reached an accuracy close to 70% in classifying the sentences in the test set. Finally, using an ensemble method comprising a panel of the 5 best CNN based methods, improves the accuracy of the results and the F1-score. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of building an assisting agent that will accompany the special needs children and adults, and assist them in their daily social interactions. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Autonomous flight in outdoor areas is possible thanks to the use of GPS that enables the drone to obtain its position in latitude and longitude coordinates. However, GPS may become unreliable when the drone flies in environments where the signal may get occluded. Malicious attacks may also compromise the GPS signal, aiming at blocking the signal or replacing it with spurious data. Motivated by these scenarios, we present preliminary results of a methodology aimed at estimating the GPS position of a drone using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a learning-based strategy. For the latter, we have adopted the PoseNet CNN architecture, originally proposed to address the relocalisation or kidnapping camera problem for facing forward cameras. First we trained PoseNet with a set of aerial images captured with an on-board camera, providing X, Y and Z coordinates as labels, which are obtained from converting GPS coordinates into metres for X and Y, and using the altimeter for Z. Then we perform validation flights where the vehicle follows a different trajectory to that used for collecting the training datasets. Even when the terrain includes bushes and repetitive texture, the CNN returns predictions with an error around the 2.5 metres and a processing speed of 15 milliseconds on average. We argue that a system such as this could be used as an emergency option to return the drone to home in the event of GPS failure. To our knowledge, this is the first time PoseNet is tested to address the problem of geo-localisation of aerial images. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

We present a geometric model of this region based on antenna simulations and data collected with a real system. Our main contribution is a strategy that takes advantage of a UAV's ability to change altitude and exploits a special structure occurring when approaching the target beacon from above to reduce the flight time required to land near the beacon.

However, the countermeasures of detected invading UAVs, if not carefully designed, may also cause controversy. Existing research and practices mostly consider two-stage systems: UAV detection and interdiction/neutralization after detection. While such ''immediate neutralization after detection'' strategy sounds reasonable in mission-critical scenarios (e.g., battlefields), its implementation in civil applications could be complicated. On one hand, personal interdiction of flying UAVs may result in legal consequence as evident from several recent real-world cases. On the other hand, it could be too late to react when a UAV damage is happening. Therefore, a UAV threat shall be predicted in advance and an early alarm system shall be in place before appropriate interdiction/neutralization (e.g., by resorting to law enforcement) is deemed necessary. In this paper, we propose a multi-layered threat analysis approach to UAVs that have been detected in a dynamic environment. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Although rare, central venous catheterisation is associated with mechanical complications that can be life-threatening if untreated. Real-time ultrasound guidance reduces the incidence of mechanical complications when compared with the anatomic landmark method. The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of and potential risk factors associated with early mechanical complications of central venous catheterisation in an era where real-time ultrasound guidance has become clinical practice. Methods and analysis This is a prospective, controlled, multicentre, observational study. All participating hospitals follow the same clinical guidelines for central venous catheterisation. Each central venous catheter insertion will be recorded in the common electronic chart system according to a recently revised template. An automated script-based search will identify all recorded central venous catheter insertion templates during the study period and relevant variables will be extracted. Outcome measures and independent variables are pre-defined in this study protocol. Multivariable and univariable logistic regression analysis will be used to determine associations and risk factors of mechanical complications.

Accurate, high-throughput methods of quantifying disease are needed by breeders to better develop resistant plant varieties and by researchers to better understand the mechanisms of plant resistance and pathogen virulence. Northern leaf blight (NLB) is a serious disease affecting maize and is responsible for significant yield losses. A Mask R-CNN model was trained to segment NLB disease lesions in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. The trained model was able to accurately detect and segment individual lesions in a hold-out test set. The mean intersect over union (IOU) between the ground truth and predicted lesions was 0.73, with an average precision of 0.96 at an IOU threshold of 0.50. Over a range of IOU thresholds (0.50 to 0.95), the average precision was 0.61.

The distances of such UAVs need to be considered in calculation of the deviation caused by the curvature of the Earth. To avoid negative effects of the distances to path planning, in this paper, we proposed a path planning method based on dimensionality reduction mapping. First, we use Gauss positive projection to project the route data and the threat information from the geodetic coordinates to the Gauss plane coordinates to perform dimensionality reduction mapping. Then, we use multi-objective optimization Dijkstra algorithm to obtain the optimal path with minimum total cost. Finally, Gauss inverse projection is applied to restore the optimal path at the geodetic coordinate system, providing the navigation information for HALE UAV. The simulation results have demonstrated that the method is suitable for calculating a path with large latitude and longitude range, and can be effectively used for path planning of a HALE UAV. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This demo focuses on the need of verticals to dynamically deploy services at the edge and to adapt the vertical service to network operational conditions. In particular, it is presented the Extended Virtual Sensing (EVS) service, which deployed on demand at the distributed computing infrastructure (i.e. in the network), complements sensing and processing functions running in the car to detect the risk of collisions and take appropriate action, even if there is no direct communication between cars. The stringent latency constraints imposed by the EVS network service leave a limited processing budget at the vertical service level. Since such processing time is correlated with the CPU consumption of a virtual machine running a VNF of the EVS network service, in this demo we also show how the vertical service exploits the automated scaling capabilities offered by the 5GT service orchestrator to deploy a new instance of the EVS VNF upon reception of a CPU consumption alert generated by the available 5GT monitoring platform. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Two problem settings were applied to our numerical calculations. First, the airfoil was fixed at a constant angle of attack to analyze the aerodynamic characteristics and the hydrodynamic moment. Second, the angle of attack of airfoils was passively changed by the fluid force to analyze the attitude stability. The current numerical solver for the flow field around an unsteady rotating airfoil was validated against the published numerical data. It was confirmed that the corrugated airfoil performs (in terms of the lift-to-drag ratio) much better than the profiled NACA2408 airfoil at low Reynolds number Re = 4000 in low angle of attack range of 0◦–6◦, and performs as well at the angle of attack of 6◦ or more. At these low angles of attack, the corrugated airfoil experiences an increase in the pressure drag and decrease in shear drag due to recirculation zones inside the cavities formed by the pleats. Furthermore, the increase in the lift for the corrugated airfoil is due to the negative pressure produced at the valleys. It was found that the lift and drag in the 2D numerical calculation are strong fluctuating at a high angle of attacks. However, in 3D simulation, especially for a 3D corrugated airfoil with unevenness in the spanwise direction, smaller fluctuations and the smaller average value in the lift and drag were obtained than the results in 2D calculations. It was found that a 3D wing with irregularities in the spanwise direction could promote three-dimensional flow and can suppress lift fluctuations even at high angles of attack. For the attitude stability, the corrugated airfoil is statically more unstable near the angle of attack of 0◦, has a narrower static stable range of the angle of attack, and has a larger amplitude of fluctuations of the angle of attack compared with the profiled NACA2408 airfoil. Based on the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion, it was confirmed that the control systems of the angle of attack passively changed by the fluid force for both two airfoils are unstable systems. c 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

LFTs are commonly abnormal, the causes of which can be complex and are frequently under investigated. This can lead to missed opportunities to diagnose and treat liver disease at an early stage. We developed an automated investigation algorithm, intelligent liver function testing (iLFT), with the aim of increasing the early diagnosis of liver disease in a cost-effective manner. Methods: We developed an automated system that further investigated abnormal LFTs on initial testing samples to generate a probable diagnosis and management plan. We integrated this automated investigation algorithm into the laboratory management system, based on minimal diagnostic criteria, liver fibrosis estimation, and reflex testing for causes of liver disease. This algorithm then generated a diagnosis and/or management plan. A stepped-wedged trial design was utilised to compare LFT outcomes in general practices in the 6 months before and after introduction of the iLFT system. Diagnostic outcomes were collated and compared. Results: Of eligible patients with abnormal LFTs, 490 were recruited to the control group and 64 were recruited to the intervention group. The primary diagnostic outcome was based on the general practitioner diagnosis, which agreed with the iLFT diagnosis in 67% of cases. In the iLFT group, the diagnosis of liver disease was increased by 43%. Additionally, there were significant increases in the rates of GP visits after diagnosis and the number of referrals to secondary care in the iLFT group. iLFT was cost-effective with a low initial incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £284 per correct diagnosis, and a saving to the NHS of £3,216 per patient lifetime. Conclusions: iLFT increases liver disease diagnoses, improves quality of care, and is highly cost-effective. This can be achieved with minor changes to working practices and exploitation of functionality existing within modern laboratory diagnostics systems. Lay summary: There is a growing epidemic of advanced liver disease, this could be offset by early detection and management. Checking liver blood tests (LFTs) should be an opportunity to diagnose liver problems, but abnormal results are often incompletely investigated. In this study we were able to substantially increase the diagnostic yield of the abnormal LFTs using the automated intelligent LFT system. With the addition of referral recommendations and management plans, this strategy provides optimum investigation and management of LFTs and is cost saving to the NHS. © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver","Article","Final","Scopus"

In line with this new trend, we characterize, from an availability viewpoint, an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) architecture deployed in a containerized environment (dubbed cIMS), which represents a pivotal part of novel network architectures such as 5G. Firstly, we model the availability of cIMS by employing both Reliability Block Diagram (RBD), to capture logical dependencies among cIMS nodes, and Stochastic Reward Networks (SRN), to characterize individually the probabilistic behavior of each node.

In this respect, visual cameras represent a key instrument to enable coordination by giving each UAV the capability to visually monitor the other members of the formation. Hence, a related technological challenge is the development of robust solutions to detect and track cooperative targets through a sequence of frames. In this framework, this paper proposes an innovative approach to carry out this task based on deep learning. Specifically, the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection system is integrated within an original processing architecture in which the machine-vision algorithms are aided by navigation hints available thanks to the cooperative nature of the formation. An experimental flight test campaign, involving formations of two multirotor UAVs, is conducted to collect a database of images suitable to assess the performance of the proposed approach. Results demonstrate high-level accuracy, and robustness against challenging conditions in terms of illumination, background and target-range variability. © 2019 by the authors.

Existing jamming technology requires sustained visual line of sight targets and is most effective in countering threats from relatively slow and RF compliant videography drones. Physical interdiction using nets is again only suitable for low-speed interception. Small vehicles based on commercially available consumer drone technology with a mass of less than 1 kg and package size of 15 cm can achieve flight speeds in excess of 70 m/s and can accelerate at up to 15g, and are sufficiently inexpensive as to be considered disposable. Custom flight control systems bypass geofence restrictions and the wide availability of high power radio links greatly exceeding OFCOM limits significantly reduces the range over which commercial jamming systems are effective. Static acceleration performance is maximised simply by decreasing the power loading and decreasing the disc loading and is approximately independent of the size (mass) of the vehicle. Maximisation of top speed is more complex, requiring identification of an optimal disc loading that balances thrust against rotor drag. Top speed is also affected by area/volume scaling meaning that larger vehicles with the same power to weight ratio and disc loading generally have less drag and hence higher top speed. Consumer technology for very high thrust to weight ratio variants of larger multirotor drones is currently not readily available. However, 10 kg drones with a top speed of 100 m/s and static acceleration of 20 g are foreseeable in the next 5 years. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

When the communication graph among agents is connected, a novel parallel and distributed consensus-based algorithm is proposed to derive an RTP scheme to facilitate DR, and when communication uncertainties exist, a robust consensus algorithm is proposed to cease the effect of uncertainties. Next, this paper proposes a novel control mechanism to tackle the problem of disconnected communication among agents, e.g., under cyber-attacks, by employing the so-called mixed communication-broadcast control architecture where the underlying ideas are twofold. First, each area in the grid associated with a connected subgraph is controlled by a MAS to guarantee the power balance and to reach consensus on the local electric price for that area. Second, a supervisory unit observes those local electric prices to calculate the global electric price for the whole grid and then broadcasts to all units so that they can properly adjust their output powers.

That is because most SLAM algorithms are feature-based techniques and often it is impossible to extract the matched features from blurry underwater images. To get more useful features, image processing techniques can be used to dehaze the images before they are used in a navigation/localization algorithm. There are many well-developed methods for image restoration, but the degree of enhancement and the resource cost of the methods are different. In this paper, we propose a new visual SLAM, specifically-designed for the underwater environment, using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance the quality of underwater images with underwater image quality evaluation metrics. This procedure increases the efficiency of SLAM and gets a better navigation and localization accuracy.

Behind the wheels of these mobile robots lies machine learning (ML) to automate mundane driving tasks and make decisions from situational awareness. Attacking ML, the brain of driverless cars, can cause catastrophes. This paper proposes a novel approach to attack CAV by fooling its ML model. Using adversarial examples in CAVs, the work demonstrates how adversarial machine learning can generate attacks hardly detectable by current ML classifiers for CAV misbehavior detection. First, adversarial datasets are generated by a traditional attack engine, which CAV misbehavior detection ML models can easily detect. Building attack ML model takes two phases: Training and testing. Using supervised learning, Phase I trains the model on the time-series data, converted from the adversarial datasets. Phase II tests the model, which leads, for the next round of model improvement. The initial round deploys K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, respectively. The next round, guided by deep learning (DL) models, uses Logistic Regression (LG) of neural network and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) of recurrent neural network. The results, in precision-recall (PR) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, validate the effectiveness of the proposed adversarial ML models. This work reveals the vulnerability in ML. At the same time, it shows the promise to protect critical infrastructure by studying the opponent strategies.

Background: The barrage of data in the GCS visual interface has the potential to isolate the operator from detecting system hazards that threatens the ability of the operator to operate the UAS effectively. Method: The pitch of the UAS’s engine revolutions per minute was mapped to a sonification, and excessive attitude upset of the UAS was mapped to a tactification in order to present a continuous awareness of the system’s health without being invasive and obtrusive. Participants with and without flying experience were required to monitor system health, while carrying out a secondary task. Results: Regardless of flying experience, sonification enhanced hazard detection compared to a visual-only GCS interface, but tactification did not aid performance. Conclusion: While multimodal displays have been studied in remotely piloted vehicles, this is the initial effort to demonstrate that sonification can influence perceived urgency leading to greater warning compliance. Further research is warranted to develop guidelines to ensure that non-visual signals can convey different levels of urgency for a continuous awareness of a system’s health, and thereby permit the operator to establish the appropriate level of priority to address the alarmed condition. © 2019, © 2019 Crown Copyright.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This paper is concerned with the automated mapping of cropland strips that are common in the North China Plain. These strips are commonly 3-8 m in width and 50-300 m in length, and are separated by small ridges that assist with irrigation. Conventional surveying methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming for this application, and only limited performance is possible with very high resolution satellite images. Small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) images could provide an alternative approach to ridge detection and strip mapping. This paper presents a novel method for detecting cropland strips, utilizing centimeter spatial resolution imagery captured by sUAS flying at low altitude (60 m). Using digital surface models (DSM) and ortho-rectified imagery from sUAS data, this method extracts candidate ridge locations by surface roughness segmentation in combination with geometric constraints. This method then exploits vegetation removal and morphological operations to refine candidate ridge elements, leading to polyline-based representations of cropland strip boundaries. This procedure has been tested using sUAS data from four typical cropland plots located approximately 60 km west of Jinan, China. The plots contained early winter wheat. The results indicated an ability to detect ridges with comparatively high recall and precision (96.8% and 95.4%, respectively). Cropland strips were extracted with over 98.9% agreement relative to ground truth, with kappa coefficients over 97.4%. To our knowledge, this method is the first to attempt cropland strip mapping using centimeter spatial resolution sUAS images. These results have demonstrated that sUAS mapping is a viable approach for data collection to assist in agricultural land management in the North China Plain. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The clutters form static/non-static objects in the collected radio frequency (RF) signals are suppressed via employing the background estimate method and suppressing the linear trend. Then principal component of the RF signals are extracted based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. The higher order cumulant (HOC) algorithm is utilized to improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the RF signals, which can make Gaussian noise prone to zero. Hilbert spectrums of the analyzed features are considered to determine if one MUAV is present in the detection area using ANN. Finally, the region of interest (ROI) containing RF signals is defined to estimate the azimuth and first frequency of MUAV. Detection results in real-life scenarios are obtained which show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in detecting MUAV. © 2019","Article","Final","Scopus"

Yet, the effects of ADS on drivers’ visual sampling patterns to the forward roadway remain underexplored. This study examined the eye movements of 24 young drivers during either manual (L0) or partially automated driving (L2) in a driving simulator. After completing a hazard anticipation training program, Road Awareness and Perception Training, drivers in both groups navigated a single simulated drive consisting of four environment types: highway, town, rural, and residential. Drivers of the simulated L2 system were instructed to keep their hands on the steering wheel and told that the system controls the speed and lateral positioning of the vehicle while avoiding potential threats on the forward roadway. The data indicate that the drivers produced fewer fixations during automated driving compared with manual driving. However, the breadth of horizontal and vertical eye movements and the mean fixation durations did not strongly support the null results between the two conditions.

However, there is a rising concern about the robustness of these systems because of their susceptibility to adversarial attacks on DNNs. Past research has established that DNNs used for classification and object detection are prone to attacks causing targeted misclassification. In this paper, we show the effectiveness of an adversarial dynamic attack on an end-to-end trained DNN controlling an autonomous vehicle. We launch the attack by installing a billboard on the roadside and displaying videos to approaching vehicles to cause the DNN controller in the vehicle to generate steering commands that cause, for example, unintended lane changes or motion off the road causing accidents. The billboard has an integrated camera estimating the pose of the on-coming vehicle. The approach enables dynamic adversarial perturbation that adapts to the relative pose of the vehicle and uses the dynamics of the vehicle to steer it along adversary-chosen trajectories while being robust to variations in view, lighting, and weather. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack on a recently published off-the-shelf end-to-end learning-based autonomous navigation system in a high-fidelity simulator, CARLA (CAR Learning to Act).

Nevertheless, VCPS can be hindered by information falsification problem, resulting due to the wrong perception of a traffic event or deliberate faking by the participating vehicles. Such information fabrication causes the re-routing of vehicles and artificial congestion, leading to economic, safety, environmental, and health hazards. Thus, it is imperative to infer truthful traffic information in real-time to restore the operational reliability of the VCPS. In this work, we propose a novel reputation scoring and decision support framework, called Spoofed and False Report Eradicator (SAFE), which offers a cost-effective and efficient solution to handle information falsification problem in the VCPS domain. The framework includes humans in the sensing loop by exploiting the paradigm of participatory sensing, a concept of a mobile security agent (MSA) to nullify the effects of deliberate false contribution, and a variant of the distance bounding mechanism to thwart location-spoofing attacks. A regression-based model integrates these effects to generate the expected truthfulness of a participant's contribution. To determine if any contribution is true or false, a generalized linear model is used to transform the expected truthfulness into a Quality of Contribution (QoC) score. The QoC of different reports is aggregated to compute user reputation. Such reputation enables classification of different participation behaviors. Finally, an Expected Utility Theory (EUT)-based decision model is proposed that utilizes the reputation score to determine if event-specific information should be published or dropped. To evaluate the SAFE framework through experimental study, we used both simulated and real data to compare its reputation-based user segregation performance with stateof- the-art frameworks. Experimental results exhibit that SAFE captures the fine differences in participants' behavior through the quality and quantity of participation, and the accuracy of their informed location. It also significantly improves operational reliability through publishing the information of only legitimate events. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Owing to its versatility to fly inside the tunnels, it can quickly identify defects and potential problems related to safety. However, long tunnels, especially with repetitive or uniform structures pose a significant problem for UAV navigation. Furthermore, post-processing visual data from the camera mounted on the UAV is required to generate useful information for the inspection task. In this work, we design a UAV with a single rotating camera to accomplish the task. Compared to other platforms, our solution can fit the stringent requirement for tunnel inspection, in terms of battery life, size and weight. While the current state-of-the-art can estimate camera pose and 3D geometry from a sequence of images, they assume large overlap, small rotational motion, and many distinct matching points between images. These assumptions severely limit their effectiveness in tunnel-like scenarios where the camera has erratic or large rotational motion, such as the one mounted on the UAV. This paper presents a novel solution which exploits Structure-from-Motion, Bundle Adjustment, and available geometry priors to robustly estimate camera pose and automatically reconstruct a fully-dense 3D scene using the least possible number of images in various challenging tunnel-like environments.

In this paper, we investigate the anti-jamming V2V communication in CAV networks through power control in conjunction with channel selection. Bringing into play a brain-inspired research tool called cognitive dynamic system (CDS), the general structure of cognitive risk control (CRC) is well-tailored to analyze and address the jamming problem. Specifically, power control is carried out first using reinforcement learning, the result of which is then examined by a module called task-switch control. Based on the risk assessment, a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is formulated to perform the channel-selection process when necessary. Through continuous perception-action cycles (PACs), the feature of predictive adaptation is realized for the legitimate vehicle in its behavioral interactions with the jammer.

An average of 5400 urothelial cells were identified in each WSI. The algorithm achieved an area under the curve of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83-0.93). Using the optimal operating point, the algorithm's sensitivity was 79.5% (95% CI, 64.7%-90.2%) and the specificity was 84.5% (95% CI, 81.6%-87.1%) for high-grade urothelial carcinoma. Conclusions: The authors successfully developed a computational algorithm capable of accurately analyzing WSIs of urine cytology cases. Compared with prior studies, this effort used a much larger data set, exploited whole slide–level and not just cell-level features, and used a cell gallery to display the algorithm's output for easy end-user review. This algorithm provides computer-assisted interpretation of urine cytology cases, akin to the machine learning technology currently used for automated Papanicolaou test screening. © 2019 American Cancer Society","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, due to limited prior information about the target, the complex dynamics environment, and significant time-delay, performing a descent and landing on the small body surface is challenging. Among all the techniques required for achieving a safe landing, onboard guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) is of paramount importance in determining mission success. In this paper, a systematic survey of the autonomous GNC technologies for descent and landing on small bodies is carried out. First, based on an analysis of the technical challenges in the process, an overview of typical small body landing and sample return missions is given. Then, an elaboration of the state-of-the-art GNC technologies is presented. Specifically, autonomous navigation methods in unknown environments with highly-nonlinear dynamics are introduced. Descent guidance and control algorithms that take into account landing performance optimization and system robustness against model uncertainties are discussed. Touchdown dynamics and control methods proposed for precise and safe surface contact under weak gravity are analyzed. And safe strategies for onboard detected emergencies such as collision threats and system malfunctions are explained. Besides the prevalent methods, innovative techniques with respect to observability-based optimization, edge curve matching, online landing site selection, collision probability-based hazard avoidance, and trajectory curvature guidance proposed for improving system safety and landing performance are elucidated. At last, based on the growing system autonomy and operational complexity demands, a prospect of future research directions for small body GNC technologies is given. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Review","Final","Scopus"

Attack surfaces can be sometimes detected automatically, regarding the used language, by matching them against known attacks still is a step apart. Further, systems and attacks are not usually modeled with compatible formalism. This paper develops a modeling framework that automates the whole process by generating attacks for cyber physical systems. First, we formalize a system using UML class and activity diagrams. Further, we use UML to develop a meta language for cyber physical systems, cyber attacks, and cyber counter measures. The framework instantiates the dependent-application diagrams for the domain/application in test, searches for the existing attack surfaces; then it generates the possible attacks that might exploit the found vulnerabilities/weaknesses.

The author has acknowledged these errors and the online version has been updated with these changes. The article title has been changed to “Why ‘Accommodation’ Makes the Most Sense for China's Long-term Xinjiang Strategy”. Below are the paragraphs where we have made these alterations to the online version: In late 2018, China confirmed what the rest of the world had already suspected: it has set up massive re-education camps in its western-most province, the “Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region”. This marks a new chapter in Beijing’s official efforts to manage its far west, one which has many people concerned as to where thismay lead in the future. Officially, according to the Xinjiang regional authorities, the camps have been initiated in order to “carry out anti-extremist ideological education”.1 Beijing has also stressed that contrary to suggestions in the West—The Washington Post Editorial Board went as far to elicit Nazi concentration camps as an analogy—these camps are not forced brainwashing centers but rather voluntary vocational training centers where participants are taught an array of life skills.2 Of course, few in the West are buying such a claim, but one cannot discount some level of belief in Beijing that the Chinese model is a blueprint for achieving development and that, really, this is about compassion, not subjugation.3 More recently, however, Beijing’s strategy has shifted to overtly focusing on facilitating the assimilation of the Uighur people into adopting Chinese language, culture, and customs;12 at the expense of the Uighurs’ own unique language, culture, and customs.13 Of course, the re-education camps are a core part of this strategy of assimilation, but it doesn’t stop there. Another measure has been the initiating of a policy whereby ethnically Han volunteers live with Uighur families for a period of time in order to teach them Chinese customs and to, more covertly, monitor these families’ assimilation trajectories.14 Arguably, the reason Beijing believes an outcome of assimilation is possible with the Uighurs is that it has managed to, relatively, assimilate another Islamic community— the Hui—into following an ostensibly Chinese way of life. The Hui, like the Uighurs have had a history of challenging Beijing. The Dungan Revolt of 1862–77—a conflict which coincided with the breakaway of Kashgaria—had its origins in the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu.15 However, unlike the Uighurs, the Hui have gradually acquiesced into accepting the legitimacy of the Chinese state. The apparent assimilation of the Hui represents a fairly modern undertaking which perhaps gives Beijing hope that such successes can also be achieved with the Uighurs. This is not to say that the threat of Uyghur (Islamist) extremism is not a legitimate concern for Beijing, because it clearly is.27 However, there is a likely exaggeration of the threat of this terrorism—like what has occurred in the United Kingdom and the United States—which helps construct a pretext (i.e. the process of securitization) to mask not only China’s creeping centralization in recent years.28 But also this gives Beijing tools to help secure its flagship project, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), for which Xinjiang is a key corridor.29 Thus, political changes in Beijing cannot be eliminated as an important factor here as what is happening in Xinjiang links with broader trends in China. Elimination, obviously, is a strategy of destroying the community through dispersion, enslavement or genocide. One of the most recent examples of an empire attempting a strategy of elimination was Nazi Germany’s perpetration of the holocaust against Jewish communities in Europe. Elimination is, of course, evil and has no place in the twenty-first century, but it is also not an easy strategy for an empire to use as once a targeted community is faced with certain death it tends to provoke a “fight to the end” mentality, making lasting subjugation more difficult.38 Accommodation is a strategy of allowing a community a measure of autonomy in exchange for a share of its resources (whether financial, physical or human). Marks calls accommodation the “engine of empire” and cites the Roman expansion beyond the Italian peninsula as the artful deployment of accommodation.39 Accommodation is not a silver bullet by any means as it leaves the metropole vulnerable to the target communities changing their mind or collaborating with an adversary. But, when executed well, accommodation provides an equilibrium for the benefits of scale with the benefits of smaller communities. The international community, which has been quite muted on the issue to date, needs to come to the party sooner rather than later in communicating constructively with Beijing about this issue in order to dissuade some potentially horrific outcomes. Ideally, self-determination for the Uighur in the shape of more autonomy or statehood would be the optimal long-term outcome one should hope for. But, in reality, this is not a time for idealism and one has to accept that their domination under Beijing will continue for the time being—particularly given the changing demographics of Xinjiang and the importance of China’s BRI.43 And while no form of empire is ideal, at the very least, encouraging Beijing to adopt a strategy of accommodation over either a strategy of assimilation or, heaven forbid, a strategy of elimination has to be a starting point for those that want a change in Beijing’s Xinjiang policy. © 2019, © 2019 Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs.","Erratum","Final","Scopus"

In Vertical Axis Washing Machines (VA-WM), knowing the laundry composition is fundamental to setting the washing cycle properly with positive impact both on energy/water consumption and on washing performance. An indication of the load typology composition (cotton, silk, etc.) is typically provided by the user through a physical selector that, unfortunately, is often placed by the user on the most general setting due to the discomfort of manually changing configurations. An automated mechanism to determine such key information would thus provide increased user experience, better washing performance, and reduced consumption; for this reason, we present here a data-driven soft sensor that exploits physical measurements already available on board a commercial VA-WM to provide an estimate of the load typology through a machine-learning-based statistical model of the process.

The proposed Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) model predicts the identity of the driver based on the individual's unique driving patterns learned from the vehicle telematics data. Given the telematics is time-series data, the problem is formulated as a time series prediction task to exploit the embedded sequential information. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on three naturalistic driving datasets, which gives high accuracy prediction results. The robustness of the model on noisy and anomalous data that is usually caused by sensor defects or environmental factors is also investigated.

Therefore, a model parameter estimation method to meet all these requirements becomes a challenge for CUAS systems. In this paper, a novel hopping parameter estimation method based on random sample consensus called HopSAC is proposed to conquer this challenge.

It is crucial for the AV to correctly understand and predict the future trajectories of pedestrians to avoid collision and plan a safe path. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown promising results in accurately predicting pedestrian trajectories, relying on large amounts of annotated real-world data to learn pedestrian behavior. However, collecting and annotating these large real-world pedestrian datasets is costly in both time and labor. This paper describes a novel method using a stochastic sampling-based simulation to train DNNs for pedestrian trajectory prediction with social interaction. Our novel simulation method can generate vast amounts of automatically-annotated, realistic, and naturalistic synthetic pedestrian trajectories based on small amounts of real annotation. We then use such synthetic trajectories to train an off-the-shelf state-of-the-art deep learning approach Social GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) to perform pedestrian trajectory prediction. Our proposed architecture, trained only using synthetic trajectories, achieves better prediction results compared to those trained on human-annotated real-world data using the same network. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness and potential of using simulation as a substitution for human annotation efforts to train high-performing prediction algorithms such as the DNNs. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Similarly, ways to detect drones through easily accessible programs like WireShark have raised more potential threats, including an increase in ease of jamming and spoofing drones utilizing commercially of the shelf (COTS) equipment like software defined radio (SDR). Given these advancements, an active area of research is drone security. Recent research has focused on using a HackRF SDR to perform eavesdropping or jamming attacks; however, most have failed to show a proposed remediation. Similarly, many research papers show post analysis of communications, but seem to lack a conclusive demonstration of command manipulation. Our security assessment shows clear steps in the manipulation of a WiFi drone using the aircrack-ng suite without the need for additional equipment like a SDR. This shows that anyone with access to a computer could potentially take down a drone. Alarmingly, we found that the COTS WiFi drone in our experiment still lacked the simple security measure of a password, and were very easily able to take over the drone in a deauthorization attack. We include a proposed remediation to mitigate the preformed attack and assess the entire process using the STRIDE and DREAD models.

In this paper, we present an anti-eavesdropping scheme based on multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) who emit jamming signals to disturb eavesdropping activities. We name such friendly UAV-enabled jamming scheme as Fri-UJ scheme. In particular, UAV-enabled jammers (UJs) emit artificial noise to mitigate the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at eavesdroppers consequently reducing the eavesdropping probability. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed Fri-UJ scheme, we establish a theoretical framework to analyze both the local eavesdropping probability and the overall eavesdropping probability. Our analytical results show that the Fri-UJ scheme can significantly reduce the eavesdropping risk while having nearly no impact on legitimate communications. Meanwhile, the simulation results also agree with the analytical results, verifying the accuracy of the proposed model. The merits of Fri-UJ scheme include the deployment flexibility and no impact on legitimate communications. © 2011 KICS.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Protrusions of heights 0.5%c, 1%c, and 2%c are placed at one of the three locations, viz, the leading edge (LE), 5%c on the suction surface, and 5%c on the pressure surface, while the angle of attack (AOA) is varied between 0° and 20°. Results obtained from the time-averaged solution of the unsteady Navier-Stokes equation indicate that the smaller protrusion placed at 5%c on the suction surface improves the post-stall lift coefficient by up to 59%, without altering the pre-stall characteristics. The improvement in time-averaged lift coefficients comes with enhanced flow unsteadiness due to vigorous vortex shedding. For a given protrusion height, the vortex shedding frequency decreases as the AOA is increased, while the amplitude of fluctuations in lift coefficient increases as the protrusion height is increased or as the AOA is increased. Nevertheless, mitigation of static stall phenomena is observed for most configurations investigated, and this finding can be beneficial for the design of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). The enhancement in the vortex shedding frequencies due to triangular protrusion can be utilized for Vortex-Induced Vibrations (VIVs)-based energy generators.

During the last decade, several lightweight two-factor or three-factor authentication and key agreement protocols have been proposed to provide secure communication links between users and sensor nodes. However, after careful assessment of these works, we found that two of recently proposed ones, which have tried to improve their previous works, are still susceptible to strong replay attacks or do not provide perfect forward secrecy. Therefore, to address this concern, in this paper, we propose a secure and lightweight authentication and key agreement protocol for IoT based WSNs that is free from the security challenges of previous protocols.

Auto-driving vehicles, nowadays, are fully equipped with numerous sensors such as cameras, geo-sensors, and radar sensors, to capture real-time data inside the vehicles and outside surroundings. Meanwhile, the captured data contains lots of private information about vehicles, drivers and passengers and thus faces a high risk of privacy breaches. Especially, side-channel information can be mined from camera data to identify vehicles' locations and even trajectories, raising serious privacy issues. Unfortunately, the issue, how to resist location-inference attack for camera data in auto-driving, has never been addressed in literature.

The conventional way to tackle this problem is based on the alternating optimization (AO) method by iteratively updating power and trajectory until convergence, resulting in a non-convex trajectory subproblem which is difficult to deal with. To develop more efficient methods, we propose a novel AO method by incorporating both power and trajectory into an intermediate variable, and then iteratively updating power and the newly introduced variable. This novel variable transformation makes it easier to decompose the original problem into two convex subproblems, namely a throughput maximization subproblem and a feasibility subproblem. Consequently, both of these subproblems can be solved in a globally optimal fashion. We further propose a low-complexity algorithm for the feasibility subproblem by exploiting the alternating directional method of multipliers (ADMM), whose updating step is performed in closed-form solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method reduces the computation time by orders of magnitude, while achieving higher performance than the conventional methods. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Due to the broadcast nature of the wireless signal and the openness of the space, UAV eavesdroppers (UEDs) pose a potential threat to ground communications. In this paper, we consider the communications of a legitimate ground link in the presence of friendly jamming and UEDs within a finite area of space. The spatial distribution of the UEDs obeying a uniform binomial point process (BPP) is used to characterize the randomness of the UEDs. The ground link is assumed to experience log-distance path loss and Rayleigh fading, while free space path loss with/without the averaged excess path loss due to the environment is used for the air-to-ground/air-to-air links. A piecewise function is proposed to approximate the line-of-sight (LoS) probability for the air-to-ground links, which provides a better approximation than using the existing sigmoid-based fitting. The analytical expression for the secure connection probability (SCP) of the legitimate ground link in the presence of non-colluding UEDs is derived. The analysis reveals some useful trends in the SCP as a function of the transmit signal to jamming power ratio, the locations of the UAV jammer, and the height of UAVs. © 2019 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In order to improve parking space allocation, we incorporate a fair recurrent Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism. ASAP leverages truthful bidding from the bidders while providing higher utilization to PFPs due to the inherent ability of AVs to move without the presence of an actual human in them, thus increasing revenue. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of parking auction through sophisticated software agents that are capable of quickly and seamlessly performing tasks such as parking lookup, negotiation, pricing, and reservation. We introduce an auction-related priority such that it serves two purposes: (1) provides fairness by restraining bidders opt out, and (2) reduces traffic that arises as a result of increased utilization of parking space with AVs' ability to move by themselves. ASAP guarantees the properties of strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and budget balance. It sacrifices allocation efficiency to ensure the fairness issue.

Among these, many are capable not only of assimilating real-time data to correct their predictive shortcomings but also of improving their future performance through self-optimization. In hydrogeology, such techniques harbor great potential for informing sustainable management practices. Simulating the intricacies of groundwater flow requires an adequate representation of unknown, often highly heterogeneous geology. Unfortunately, it is difficult to reconcile the structural complexity demanded by realistic geology with the simplifying assumptions introduced in many calibration methods. The particle filter framework would provide the necessary versatility to retain such complex information but suffers from the curse of dimensionality, a fundamental limitation discouraging its use in systems with many unknowns. Due to the prevalence of such systems in hydrogeology, the particle filter has received little attention in groundwater modeling so far. In this study, we explore the combined use of dimension-reducing techniques and artificial parameter dynamics to enable a particle filter framework for a groundwater model. Exploiting freedom in the design of the dimension-reduction approach, we ensure consistency with a predefined geological pattern. The performance of the resulting optimizer is demonstrated in a synthetic test case for three such geological configurations and compared to two Ensemble Kalman Filter setups. Favorable results even for deliberately misspecified settings make us hopeful that nested particle filters may constitute a useful tool for geologically consistent real-time parameter optimization. ©2019.

The primary reason both composite and amalgam restorations fail is recurrent decay, for which composite restorations experience a 2.0–3.5-fold increase compared to amalgam. Recurrent decay is a pernicious problem—the standard treatment is replacement of defective composites with larger restorations that will also fail, initiating a cycle of ever-larger restorations that can lead to root canals, and eventually, to tooth loss. Unlike amalgam, composite lacks the inherent capability to seal discrepancies at the restorative material/tooth interface. The low-viscosity adhesive that bonds the composite to the tooth is intended to seal the interface, but the adhesive degrades, which can breach the composite/tooth margin. Bacteria and bacterial by-products such as acids and enzymes infiltrate the marginal gaps and the composite's inability to increase the interfacial pH facilitates cariogenic and aciduric bacterial outgrowth. Together, these characteristics encourage recurrent decay, pulpal damage, and composite failure. This review article examines key biological and physicochemical interactions involved in the failure of composite restorations and discusses innovative strategies to mitigate the negative effects of pathogens at the adhesive/dentin interface. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Our approach uses predictive machine learning models and metaheuristic search algorithms to guide the fuzzing of actuators so as to drive the CPS into different unsafe physical states. We demonstrate the efficacy of smart fuzzing by implementing it for two real-world CPS testbeds-a water purification plant and a water distribution system-finding attacks that drive them into 27 different unsafe states involving water flow, pressure, and tank levels, including six that were not covered by an established attack benchmark.

We exploit the UAV's mobility in three-dimensional (3D) space to improve its cognitive communication performance while controlling the co-channel interference at the primary receivers (PRs), such that the received interference power at each PR is below a prescribed threshold termed as interference temperature (IT). First, we consider the quasi-stationary UAV scenario, where the UAV is placed at a static location during each communication period of interest. In this case, we jointly optimize the UAV's 3D placement and power control to maximize the SR's achievable rate, subject to the UAV's altitude and transmit power constraints, as well as a set of IT constraints at the PRs to protect their communications. Second, we consider the mobile UAV scenario, in which the UAV is dispatched to fly from an initial location to a final location within a given task period. We propose an efficient algorithm to maximize the SR's average achievable rate over this period by jointly optimizing the UAV's 3D trajectory and power control, subject to the additional constraints on UAV's maximum flying speed and initial/final locations. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed designs for different scenarios, as compared to various benchmark schemes. It is shown that in the quasi-stationary scenario the UAV should be placed at its minimum altitude while in the mobile scenario the UAV should adjust its altitude along with horizontal trajectory, so as to maximize the SR's achievable rate in both scenarios. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

On one hand, the LoS channels make more cellular base stations (BSs) visible to a UAV as compared to the ground users, which leads to a higher macro-diversity gain for UAV-BS communications. On the other hand, they also render the UAV to impose/suffer more severe uplink/downlink interference to/from the BSs, thus requiring more sophisticated inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) techniques with more BSs involved. In this paper, we consider the uplink transmission from a UAV to cellular BSs, under spectrum sharing with the existing ground users. To investigate the optimal ICIC design and air-ground performance trade-off, we maximize the weighted sum-rate of the UAV and existing ground users by jointly optimizing the UAV's uplink cell associations and power allocations over multiple resource blocks. However, this problem is non-convex and difficult to be solved optimally. We first propose a centralized ICIC design to obtain a locally optimal solution based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. As the centralized ICIC requires global information of the network and substantial information exchange among an excessively large number of BSs, we further propose a decentralized ICIC scheme of significantly lower complexity and signaling overhead for implementation, by dividing the cellular BSs into small-size clusters and exploiting the LoS macro-diversity for exchanging information between the UAV and cluster-head BSs only. Numerical results show that the proposed centralized and decentralized ICIC schemes both achieve a near-optimal performance, and draw important design insights based on practical system setups. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, due to the unreliable wireless channel and high-dynamic topology of UAANET, the situation that a node is missing certain group key broadcast messages occurs frequently. Existing group key distribution schemes cannot be directly applied to the UAANET, because of their poor security or real-time. Therefore, we present a mutual-healing group key distribution scheme based on the blockchain. Firstly, the Ground Control Station (GCS) builds a private blockchain where the group keys distributed by GCS are recorded. Meanwhile, through the blockchain, a dynamic list of UAANET membership certificates is also managed. According to different attack models, a basic mutual-healing protocol and an enhanced one are designed based on the Longest-Lost-Chain mechanism to recover the node's lost group keys with the aid of its neighbors.

While there are many benefits that TCPSs have to offer, a major challenge that needs to be addressed to enable their proliferation is their vulnerability to cyber attacks. In this article, we demonstrate, using laboratory prototypes of TCPSs, how the approach of Dynamic Watermarking can secure them from arbitrary sensor attacks. Specifically, we consider two TCPSs of topical interest: (i) an adaptive cruise control system and (ii) a system of self-driving vehicles tracking given trajectories. In each of these systems, we first show how cyber attacks on sensors can compromise safety and cause collisions between vehicles in spite of the presence of a collision avoidance module in the system.

HT does not show any symptoms at the early stage, but can lead to various cardiovascular diseases. Hence, it is essential to identify it at the beginning stages. It is tedious to analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) signals visually due to their low amplitude and small bandwidth. Hence, to avoid possible human errors in the diagnosis of HT patients, an automated ECG-based system is developed. This paper proposes the computerized segregation of low-risk hypertension (LRHT) and high-risk hypertension (HRHT) using ECG signals with an optimal orthogonal wavelet filter bank (OWFB) system. The HRHT class is comprised of patients with myocardial infarction, stroke, and syncope ECG signals. The ECG-data are acquired from physionet’s smart health for accessing risk via ECG event (SHAREE) database, which contains recordings of a total 139 subjects. First, ECG signals are segmented into epochs of 5 min. The segmented epochs are then decomposed into six wavelet sub-bands (WSBs) using OWFB. We extract the signal fractional dimension (SFD) and log-energy (LOGE) features from all six WSBs. Using Student’s t-test ranking, we choose the high ranked WSBs of LOGE and SFD features. We develop a novel hypertension diagnosis index (HDI) using two features (SFD and LOGE) to discriminate LRHT and HRHT classes using a single numeric value. The performance of our developed system is found to be encouraging, and we believe that it can be employed in intensive care units to monitor the abrupt rise in blood pressure while screening the ECG signals, provided this is tested with an extensive independent database. © 2019 by the authors.

Short interspersed elements (SINEs) are non-autonomous, fast-evolving elements, but some of them carry a highly conserved domain (HCD), whose sequence remained substantially unchanged throughout the metazoan evolution. SINEs carrying the HCD called V are absent in amniote genomes, but V-like sequences were found within the miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) MER6 in Homo sapiens. In the present work, the genomic distribution and evolution of MER6 are investigated, in order to reconstruct the origin of human V domain and to envisage its possible functional role. The analysis of 85 tetrapod genomes revealed that MER6 and its variant MER6A are found in primates, while only the MER6A variant was found in bats and eulipotyphlans. These MITEs appeared no longer active, in line with literature data on mammalian DNA transposons. Moreover, they appeared to have originated from a Mariner element found in turtles and from a V-SINE from bony fishes. MER6 insertions were found within genes and conserved in mRNAs: in line with previous hypothesis on functional role of HCDs, the MER6 V domain may be important for cell function also in mammals. © 2019 by the authors.

Due to its direct impact on road safety, multiple prior efforts have been made to study its the security of perception systems. In contrast to prior work that concentrates on camera-based perception, in this work we perform the first security study of LiDAR-based perception in AV settings, which is highly important but unexplored. We consider LiDAR spoofing attacks as the threat model and set the attack goal as spoofing obstacles close to the front of a victim AV. We find that blindly applying LiDAR spoofing is insufficient to achieve this goal due to the machine learning-based object detection process. Thus, we then explore the possibility of strategically controlling the spoofed attack to fool the machine learning model. We formulate this task as an optimization problem and design modeling methods for the input perturbation function and the objective function. We also identify the inherent limitations of directly solving the problem using optimization and design an algorithm that combines optimization and global sampling, which improves the attack success rates to around 75%. As a case study to understand the attack impact at the AV driving decision level, we construct and evaluate two attack scenarios that may damage road safety and mobility.

The goal of the path tracking is to achieve good performance on slippery conditions. The equations describing the evolution of the path are linearized in order to obtain a suitable model, and linear constraints on the produced reference states are applied based on the prior knowledge of the reachable equilibrium states which characterize steady-state cornering. A previously proposed low-level LQR-ISM (Integral Sliding Mode) controller is exploited for reference tracking, where the ISM component is required in order to enhance the robustness with respect to the several approximations introduced by the linearized models.

The latter replaces detected personally identifiable information (PII) with random surrogates, allowing leaked PII to blend in or ""hide in plain sight."" We evaluated the extent to which a malicious attacker could expose leaked PII in such a corpus. Materials and Methods: We modeled a scenario where an institution (the defender) externally shared an 800-note corpus of actual outpatient clinical encounter notes from a large, integrated health care delivery system in Washington State. These notes were deidentified by a machine-learned PII tagger and HIPS resynthesis. A malicious attacker obtained and performed a parrot attack intending to expose leaked PII in this corpus. Specifically, the attacker mimicked the defender's process by manually annotating all PII-like content in half of the released corpus, training a PII tagger on these data, and using the trained model to tag the remaining encounter notes. The attacker hypothesized that untagged identifiers would be leaked PII, discoverable by manual review. We evaluated the attacker's success using measures of leak-detection rate and accuracy. Results: The attacker correctly hypothesized that 211 (68%) of 310 actual PII leaks in the corpus were leaks, and wrongly hypothesized that 191 resynthesized PII instances were also leaks. One-third of actual leaks remained undetected. Discussion and Conclusion: A malicious parrot attack to reveal leaked PII in clinical text deidentified by machine-learned HIPS resynthesis can attenuate but not eliminate the protective effect of HIPS deidentification. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

With the continuous improvement of autonomy, the increasing complexity of tasks, and the emergence of various types of advanced sensors, higher requirements are imposed on the computing performance of USV clusters, especially for latency sensitive tasks. However, during the execution of marine operations, due to the relative movement of the USV cluster nodes and the network topology of the cluster, the wireless channel states are changing rapidly, and the computing resources of cluster nodes may be available or unavailable at any time. It is difficult to accurately predict in advance. Therefore, we propose an optimized offloading mechanism based on the classic multi-armed bandit (MAB) theory. This mechanism enables USV cluster nodes to dynamically make offloading decisions by learning the potential computing performance of their neighboring team nodes to minimize average computation task offloading delay. It is an optimized algorithm named Adaptive Upper Confidence Boundary (AUCB) algorithm, and corresponding simulations are designed to evaluate the performance. The algorithm enables the USV cluster to effectively adapt to the marine vehicular fog computing networks, balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation (EE). The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can quickly converge to the optimal computation task offloading combination strategy under heavy and light input data loads. © 2019 by the authors.

Besides geometric information about the mapped environment, the semantics plays an important role to enable intelligent navigation behaviors. In most realistic environments, this task is particularly complicated due to dynamics caused by moving objects, which can corrupt the mapping step or derail localization. In this paper, we propose an extension of a recently published surfel-based mapping approach exploiting three-dimensional laser range scans by integrating semantic information to facilitate the mapping process. The semantic information is efficiently extracted by a fully convolutional neural network and rendered on a spherical projection of the laser range data. This computed semantic segmentation results in point-wise labels for the whole scan, allowing us to build a semantically-enriched map with labeled surfels. This semantic map enables us to reliably filter moving objects, but also improve the projective scan matching via semantic constraints.

First, we propose a communication scheme that exploits the flexible deployment of UAVs as well as their cooperative transmissions to improve in-network user admission. Unlike previous literature, a practical operational constraint of limited storage capacity for UAVs is considered. Then, from the knowledge that cooperation among UAVs depends on the availability of the contents in their limited storage space, we propose a novel joint optimization problem to determine the content placement, location planning, user admission decision and transmit beamforming to maximize the number of users experiencing a minimum required rate, so-called admitted users. Since the formulated problem is a mixed-integer non-linear program which is generally non-deterministic polynomial-time hard, we proposed a framework that is developed on the basis of difference-of-convex (DC) programming to transform the original problem into a series of approximate convex problems which can be iteratively solved until convergence. Our extensive simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme outperforms other schemes that have been introduced in previous work and reflect a notable trend that deploying more cooperative UAVs with fewer resources (power and storage capacity) is more efficient than deploying fewer UAVs with more resources. In particular, in one of our collected results, the total communication power can be reduced by roughly 40 dB when doubling the number of cooperative UAVs. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Furthermore, moral education seems to involve getting good at something through repetition; but Kant seems to eschew the notion of repeated natural activity as antithetical to autonomy. Things become even trickier once we remember that Kant also views autonomous human beings as radically evil: we are capable of choosing rationally and autonomously, but, left to our own devices, that same capacity for reason might tempt us to choose only out of a concern to satisfy our happiness. We thus need a moral education which realizes autonomy while dodging the dual bullets of external natural forces and internal evil forces. Ultimately, his concerns about external natural forces and internal evil forces do not lead Kant to reject either moral education or a role for repeated activity in it. Rather, he advocates a carefully circumscribed appeal to repeated activities within a course of Socratic moral education focused on encouraging the student, subjectively and first-personally, to claim her autonomy, resulting in the cheerful and vigilant exercise of virtue as an aptitude. © 2018, © 2018 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.","Article","Final","Scopus"

An ultraviolet detection and localization method for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) inspection of power line discharge was proposed. The PMT was driven by the steering of the steering gear to perform multi-angle detection, the current detection position and detection angle were recorded, and the preliminary positioning coordinates of the discharge point were obtained using the direction-finding cross-positioning method. In order to accurately locate the discharge point, n sets of data were solved to obtain the preliminary positioning coordinates of n(n-1)/2 discharge points. The preliminary positioning coordinates of the discharge point were then removed from the abnormal point and imported into the K-means clustering algorithm. A second solution was applied to obtain the exact coordinates of the discharge point. In the experiment, to test the relationship between the PMT detection angle and discharge ultraviolet signal, θ=90° was selected as the steering angle of the steering gear. Conducting discharge patrol experiments at 18 m, 30 m, and 50 m showed that the positioning error of discharge point are within 9.0%. The experimental results show that the method can meet the need for rapid location of the discharge point when the UAV patrols the power line. © 2019, Science Press.

Excavation is an inherently risky process due to imprecise work processes and the unstable external environment on most work sites. The resulting accidents cause serious injuries that threaten the lives of not only the excavator pilots but also those working around them. In this study, we propose a mechanical device that is capable of operating the excavator remotely from a nearby safe location such as a site office. To ensure worker safety and at the same time boost the productivity of excavation operations, data from 3D scanners, cameras, and sensors were combined to create a detailed 3D picture of the area surrounding the excavation site to guide a remotely operated excavating system. Rather than modifying the excavator itself, a removable manipulator was mounted on the joystick in the excavator’s cockpit. Our proposed system was tested on a standard commercial excavator to verify its performance for a real-world excavation task. © 2019 by the authors.

Submarine-canyon investigations are therefore significant for seafloor scientific research，submarine mineral and resource exploitation，and the construction and safety operation of submarine infrastructures. Deep-sea diving by manned submersibles and robot submersibles represented by Remotely Operated Vehicles（ROV）and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles（AUV）provides an important approach to the investigation of modern submarine canyons. The biggest advantage of manned submersibles is that they can bring scientists to the deep sea for in-place observations and precise sampling，while the robot deep-sea diving has the advantages of low cost，high efficiency，no personnel safety concerns，and the ability to reach the extreme sea areas that are difficult for humans to reach. Deep-sea diving has found broad applications in the geo-scientific research of submarine canyons. These studies cover seafloor topography and geomorphology，seafloor sediments，erosional and depositional bedforms，mass transport processes and flow dynamics，cold springs，cold-water corals and other biological habitats，as well as seafloor biological erosion. The research experience and scientific findings in scientific diving investigation of submarine canyons accumulated by the developed countries in Europe and the United States over the past 70 years are of great reference and significance to the emerging scientific deep-sea diving in China. © 2019 Science China Press.

Vehicles in an autonomous platoon can exploit vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to collect environmental information so as to maintain the target velocity and inter-vehicle distance. However, due to the uncertainty of the wireless channel, V2V communications within a platoon will experience a wireless system delay. Such system delay can impair the vehicles' ability to stabilize their velocity and distances within their platoon. In this paper, the problem of integrated communication and control system is studied for wireless connected autonomous vehicular platoons. In particular, a novel framework is proposed for optimizing a platoon's operation while jointly taking into account the delay of the wireless V2V network and the stability of the vehicle's control system. First, stability analysis for the control system is performed and the maximum wireless system delay requirements which can prevent the instability of the control system are derived. Then, delay analysis is conducted to determine the end-to-end delay, including queuing, processing, and transmission delay for the V2V link in the wireless network. Subsequently, using the derived wireless delay, a lower bound and an approximated expression of the reliability for the wireless system, defined as the probability that the wireless system meets the control system's delay needs, are derived. Then, the parameters of the control system are optimized in a way to maximize the derived wireless system reliability. Simulation results corroborate the analytical derivations and study the impact of parameters, such as the packet size and the platoon size, on the reliability performance of the vehicular platoon. More importantly, the simulation results shed light on the benefits of integrating control system and wireless network design while providing guidelines for designing an autonomous platoon so as to realize the required wireless network reliability and control system stability. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The interaction between a multi-AUV cooperative system and its marine environment will affect the reliability of the system. Current is an important influencing factor of multi-AUV cooperative systems. A reliability index of multi-AUV cooperative systems known as System Reliable Probability (SRP) is proposed in this study. A method to calculate SRP is introduced, and the influence of current on SRP is discussed in detail. Current is considered an attack source, and the degree of its influence on SRP is calculated. As an example, the performance of this method is shown on two multi-AUV cooperative systems. Results show that the influence of the same current environment on different structures of the multi-AUV cooperative systems differs.

One alternative is to train the model on labeled synthetic datasets and apply it in the real scenes. However, this straightforward method often fails to generalize well mainly due to the domain bias between the synthetic and real datasets. Many unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods were introduced to address this problem but most of them only focused on the simple classification task. This paper presents a novel UDA model which integrates both image and feature level based adaptations to solve the cross-domain object detection problem. We employ objectives of the generative adversarial network and the cycle consistency loss for image translation. Furthermore, region proposal based feature adversarial training and classification are proposed to further minimize the domain shifts and preserve the semantics of the target objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on several different adaptation scenarios, and the results demonstrate the robustness and superiority of the proposed method. © 2019","Article","Final","Scopus"
"The social phenotype: Extracting a patient-centered perspective of diabetes from health-related blogs","2019","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","10.1016/j.artmed.2019.101727","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073727482&doi=10.1016%2fj.artmed.2019.101727&partnerID=40&md5=fdcd0b3ee68a77254d0b31137742eb30","Motivations: It has recently been argued [1] that the effectiveness of a cure depends on the doctor–patient shared understanding of an illness and its treatment. Although a better communication between doctor and patient can be pursued through dedicated training programs, or by collecting patients’ experiences and symptoms by means of questionnaires, the impact of these actions is limited by time and resources. In this paper we suggest that a patient-centered view of a disease – as well as potential misalignment between patient and doctor focuses – can be inferred at a larger scale through automated textual analysis of health-related forums. People are generating an enormous amount of social data to describe their health care experiences, and continuously search information about diseases, symptoms, diagnoses, doctors, treatment options and medicines. By automatically collecting, analyzing and exploiting this information, it is possible to obtain a more detailed and nuanced vision of patients’ experience, that we call the “social phenotype” of diseases. Materials and methods: As a use-case for our analysis, we consider diabetes, a widespread disease in most industrialized countries. We create a high quality data sample of diabetic patients’ messages in Italy, extracted from popular medical forums during more than 10 years. Next, we use a state-of-the-art topic extraction technique based on generative statistical models improved with word embeddings, to identify the main complications, the frequently reported symptoms and the common concerns of these patients. Finally, in order to detect differences in focus, we compare the results of our analysis with available quality of life (QoL) assessments obtained with standard methodologies, such as questionnaires and survey studies. Results: We show that patients with diabetes, when accessing on-line forums, express a perception of their disease in a way that might be noticeably different from what is inferred from published QoL assessments on diabetes. In our study, we found that issues reported to have a daily impact on these patients are diet, glycemic control, drugs and clinical tests. These problems are not commonly considered in QoL assessments, since they are not perceived by doctors as representing severe limitations. Although limited to the case of Italian diabetic patients, we suggest that the methodology described in this paper, which is language and disease agnostic, could be applied to other diseases and countries, since misalignment between doctor and patients, and the importance of collecting unbiased patient perceptions, has been emphasized in many studies ([2,3] inter alia). Extracting the social phenotype of a disease might help acquiring patient-centered information on health care experiences on a much wider scale. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Data is exchanged between ECUs via an in-vehicle network, with the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus being the de facto standard in contemporary vehicles. Furthermore, CAVs have not only physical interfaces but also increased data connectivity to the Internet via their Telematic Control Units (TCUs), enabling remote access via mobile devices. It is also possible to tap into, and read/write data from/to the CAN bus, as data transmitted on the CAN bus is not encrypted. This naturally generates concerns about automotive cybersecurity. One commonality among most vehicular security attacks reported to date is that they ultimately require write access to the CAN bus. In order to cause targeted and intentional changes in vehicle behavior, malicious CAN injection attacks require knowledge of the CAN message format. However, since this format is proprietary to OEMs and can differ even among different models of a single make of vehicle, one must manually reverse-engineer the CAN message format of each vehicle they target - a time-consuming and tedious process that does not scale. To mitigate this difficulty, we develop LibreCAN, which can translate most CAN messages with minimal effort. Our extensive evaluation on multiple vehicles demonstrates LibreCAN's efficiency in terms of accuracy, coverage, required manual effort and scalability to any vehicle. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Although several conventional diagnostic methods have been widely adopted in the clinic, the long turn-around times of ""gold standard"" culture-based techniques, as well as the limited sensitivity of lateral-flow strip assays, thwart medical progress. In this study, a smartphone-controlled, automated, and portable system was developed for rapid molecular diagnosis of pathogens (including viruses and bacteria) via the use of a colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) approach on a passive, self-driven microfluidic device. The system was capable of 1) purifying viral or bacterial samples with specific affinity reagents that had been pre-conjugated to magnetic beads, 2) lysing pathogens at low temperatures, 3) executing isothermal nucleic acid amplification, and 4) quantifying the results of colorimetric assays for detection of pathogens with an integrated color sensor. The entire, 40 min analytical process was automatically performed with a novel punching-press mechanism that could be controlled and monitored by a smartphone. As a proof of concept, the influenza A (H1N1) virus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria were used to characterize and optimize the device, and the limits of detection were experimentally found to be 3.2 × 10-3 hemagglutinating units (HAU) per reaction and 30 colony-forming units (CFU) per reaction, respectively; both such values represent high enough sensitivity for clinical adoption. Moreover, the colorimetric assay could be both qualitative and quantitative for detection of pathogens. This is the first instance of an easy-to-use, automated, and portable system for accurate and sensitive molecular diagnosis of either viruses or bacteria, and it is envisioned that this smartphone-controlled apparatus may serve as a platform for clinical, point-of-care pathogen detection, particularly in resource-limited settings. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Article","Final","Scopus"

For example, ground-based machines roll over cotton plants at corners and pull the cotton branches between rows, resulting in yield loss. Furthermore, heavy wheels can cause soil compaction, resulting in decreased soil biodiversity. High-volume spraying often results in harvest aids polluting the soil. A new harvest-aid application method that can save water, increase harvest-aid utilization rate without damage to soils and crops is needed to apply chemical harvest aids before harvest. Small plant protection unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with low-volume spraying methods have emerged as pesticide application technologies in recent years in China due to their high efficiency, high flexibility, low labor requirements, water savings and lack of damage to crops and soils. Here, UAVs are developed for chemical harvest-aid application by evaluating the cotton defoliation efficacy, boll opening rate, lint cotton yield and fiber quality components at two cotton field experimental sites in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China in 2016 and 2017. Ground-based machine treatment is used as a reference. The assessment is proceeded with the following steps: (1) The spray volume of UAV is optimized in 2016; (2) The experiment of 2016 is repeated to determine the optimal spray volume in 2017. The results show the following: (1) The harvest-aid performance is sensitive to the spray volume in the UAV low-volume spraying treatment, and optimal defoliation efficacy is achieved when the spray volume is 22.5 L/ha and flight velocity is 4 m/s, according to the field tests in 2016 and 2017. (2) Low-volume spraying using UAV has no negative influence on the lint cotton yield and fiber quality components. In conclusion, it is feasible to use plant protection UAV for cotton harvest-aid applications in preparation for machine harvesting. © 2019","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, this versatility and ease of use also brings a rapid evolution of threats by malicious actors that can use UAVs for criminal activities, converting them to passive or active threats. The need to protect critical infrastructures and important events from such threats has brought advances in counter UAV (c-UAV) applications. Nowadays, c-UAV applications offer systems that comprise a multi-sensory arsenal often including electro-optical, thermal, acoustic, radar and radio frequency sensors, whose information can be fused to increase the confidence of threat’s identification. Nevertheless, real-time surveillance is a cumbersome process, but it is absolutely essential to detect promptly the occurrence of adverse events or conditions. To that end, many challenging tasks arise such as object detection, classification, multi-object tracking and multi-sensor information fusion. In recent years, researchers have utilized deep learning based methodologies to tackle these tasks for generic objects and made noteworthy progress, yet applying deep learning for UAV detection and classification is considered a novel concept. Therefore, the need to present a complete overview of deep learning technologies applied to c-UAV related tasks on multi-sensor data has emerged. The aim of this paper is to describe deep learning advances on c-UAV related tasks when applied to data originating from many different sensors as well as multi-sensor information fusion. This survey may help in making recommendations and improvements of c-UAV applications for the future. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Review","Final","Scopus"

However, learning from experience has remained a mostly reactive exercise in the aftermath of major marine accidents and its effectiveness is questionable considering the recurrence of accidents with common contributing factors. In addition, the development of autonomous ships that will be radically different and more complex systems begs the question whether learning needs to be redefined to ensure an adequate level of safety performance throughout their life-cycle. In this context, this paper presents a novel framework for managing risk knowledge inspired by the way the biological immune system remembers not previously encountered threats to implement a faster immune response when the same or similar threats are faced in the future. In this novel framework learning is described as a distributed life-cycle process with interacting components in the design and operation phases. As this framework is equally applicable to conventional and autonomous ships, the latter are considered an opportunity to change the way the maritime industry thinks about learning from experience. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Given the massive amount of openly available labeled RGB data and the advent of high-quality deep learning algorithms for image-based recognition, high-level semantic perception tasks are pre-dominantly solved using high-resolution cameras. As a result of that, other sensor modalities potentially useful for this task are often ignored. In this paper, we push the state of the art in LiDAR-only semantic segmentation forward in order to provide another independent source of semantic information to the vehicle. Our approach can accurately perform full semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds at sensor frame rate. We exploit range images as an intermediate representation in combination with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) exploiting the rotating LiDAR sensor model. To obtain accurate results, we propose a novel post-processing algorithm that deals with problems arising from this intermediate representation such as discretization errors and blurry CNN outputs. We implemented and thoroughly evaluated our approach including several comparisons to the state of the art.

In addition to the advantages of using UAVs in daily life, it also causes some problems. The most important of these is the security problem. Safety vulnerability during the use of UAVs can lead to the loss of money and time and can disrupt the reputation of the city and the country. The aim of the study is to analyze the cyber attacks that UAVs may encounter with the use of UAVs in smart city applications and to make recommendations for preventing such attacks. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The development of an open source operational environment for robots, known as Robot Operating System (ROS) has come as a response to these demands. Security and privacy are crucial for the use of ROS as the chance of a compromise may lead to devastating ramifications.

In this study, a local path planning algorithm combines velocity obstacle method (VOM) with improved quantum particle swarm optimization (IQPSO) algorithm is proposed. By VOM, the USV local path planning is transformed into a multi-objective and multi-constrained optimization problem, and the IQPSO algorithm is used for optimization. IQPSO is an improved algorithm which benefits from quantum computing and quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization.

When mature, weeds can produce thousands to hundreds of thousands of seeds that can survive for a long time and posing a great threat to crops. The best way to avoid weed threats is to remove weeds before they bloom such that the chances of weed seeds falling into the soil can be reduced. Most existing drone-based weeds identification methods use additional equipments to enhance the identification ability. In addition to increasing the cost, such solutions also increase power consumption and load burden of drones. In this paper, we propose a low-cost Weed Identification System (WIS) using RGB images taken by drones as training data and applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to build the identification model. The result of the WIS can be used as a reference for agriculture researchers and can also be used to inform farmers to take necessary reactions. The WIS identifies weeds with an accuracy of up to 98.8%.

Compared to previously used methods, capturing pellets thrown from a rotary feed spreader in rows of Styrofoam boxes, the UAV based method is simpler and faster to setup and allows to cover a larger portion of the sea cage surface area. We compare results obtained with the Styrofoam box method with results we obtained by an automatic analysis of aerial videos taken by the UAV during feeding experiments. The employed method helps to gain insight into the spatial feed pellet distribution in full-scale salmon fish-cages where the feeding pipe and actual fixation of the spreader may influence the dynamic behaviour of the feeding system. This can also be seen as a step towards a continuous measuring of the feed pellet distribution, particularly in view of possible future feeding systems that may allow to adapt the feed pellet distribution to the actual fish distribution. © 2019","Review","Final","Scopus"

While moving among different Mission Areas (MA), the UAVs pass through dedicated TRA, where Energy and Data Dispensers (EDD) are scattered to allow UAV battery recharge and software update. The tridimensional trajectory planning problem to let the UAVs efficiently and swiftly move through the EDDs, towards the exit of the TRA, is investigated.

"Navy large unmanned surface and undersea vehicles: Background and issues for Congress","2019","Key Congressional Reports for July 2019. Part I","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126158454&partnerID=40&md5=3d3c9e17280d29fca07a91cdde26bfd4","The Navy wants to develop and procure three new types of unmanned vehicles (UVs) in FY2020 and beyond-Large Unmanned Surface Vehicles (LUSVs), Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicles (MUSVs), and Extra-Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (XLUUVs). The Navy is requesting $628.8 million in FY2020 research and development funding for these three UV programs and their enabling technologies. The Navy wants to acquire these three types of UVs (which this chapter refers to collectively as large UVs) as part of an effort to shift the Navy to a new fleet architecture (i.e., a new combination of ships and other platforms) that is more widely distributed than the Navy's current architecture. Compared to the current fleet architecture, this moredistributed architecture is to include proportionately fewer large surface combatants (i.e., cruisers and destroyers), proportionately more small surface combatants (i.e., frigates and Littoral Combat Ships), and the addition of significant numbers of large UVs. The Navy wants to employ accelerated acquisition strategies for procuring these large UVs, so as to get them into service more quickly. The emphasis that the Navy placed on UV programs in its FY2020 budget submission and the Navy's desire to employ accelerated acquisition strategies in acquiring these large UVs together can be viewed as an expression of the urgency that the Navy attaches to fielding large UVs for meeting future military challenges from countries such as China. The LUSV program is a proposed new start project for FY2020. The Navy wants to procure two LUSVs per year in FY2020-FY2024. The Navy wants LUSVs to be low-cost, high-endurance, reconfigurable ships based on commercial ship designs, with ample capacity for carrying various modular payloads-particularly anti-surface warfare (ASuW) and strike payloads, meaning principally anti-ship and land-attack missiles. The Navy reportedly envisions LUSVs as being 200 feet to 300 feet in length and having a full load displacement of about 2,000 tons. The MUSV program began in FY2019. The Navy plans to award a contract for the first MUSV in FY2019 and wants to award a contract for the second MUSV in FY2023. The Navy wants MUSVs, like LUSVs, to be low-cost, high-endurance, reconfigurable ships that can accommodate various payloads. Initial payloads for MUSVs are to be intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) payloads and electronic warfare (EW) systems. The Navy defines MUSVs as having a length of between 12 meters (about 39 feet) and 50 meters (about 164 feet). The Navy wants to pursue the MUSV program as a rapid prototyping effort under what is known as Section 804 acquisition authority. The XLUUV program, also known as Orca, was established to address a Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON). The Navy wants to procure nine XLUUVs in FY2020-FY2024. The Navy announced on February 13, 2019, that it had selected Boeing to fabricate, test, and deliver the first four Orca XLUUVs and associated support elements. On March 27, 2019, the Navy announced that the award to Boeing had been expanded to include the fifth Orca. The Navy's large UV programs pose a number of oversight issues for Congress, including issues relating to the analytical basis for the moredistributed fleet architecture; the Navy's accelerated acquisition strategies and funding method for these programs; technical, schedule, and cost risk in the programs; the proposed annual procurement rates for the programs; the industrial base implications of the programs; potential implications for miscalculation or escalation at sea; the personnel implications of the programs; and whether the Navy has accurately priced the work it is proposing to do in FY2020 on the programs. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Pyrethroid insecticides such as cypermethrin, cyhalothrin and deltamethrin have been often used to limit plague transmission via controlling the vector during outbreaks. However, this strategy is threatened by the development of insecticide resistance. Understanding the mechanisms underlying pyrethroid resistance is the prerequisite for successful flea control. Methods: Partial DNA sequences of X. cheopis voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene were amplified from a total of 111 individuals, collected from a natural plague epidemic foci in Baise City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China. These DNA fragments were sequenced. The frequency and distribution of kdr mutations were assessed in four X. cheopis populations. The origin of kdr mutations was investigated by phylogenetic and network analysis. Results: The classical knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation (L1014F) was detected in four field populations at frequencies ranging between 0.021-0.241. The mutant homozygote was observed only in one of the four populations. Seven haplotypes were identified, with two of them carrying the resistance L1014F mutation. Phylogenetic tree and network analysis indicated that the L1014F allele was not singly originated. Based on polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) profiling, an easy-to-use and accurate molecular assay for screening individual fleas for the L1014F mutation was developed. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this work represents the first report of the L1014F mutation in the plague vector X. cheopis. The incidence of the L1014F allele highlights the need of further studies on the phenotypic effect of this mutation in this plague vector. Early detection and monitoring of insecticide resistance is suggested in order to make effective control strategies in case of plague outbreaks in this region. © 2019 The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

The developing of annular elastic sensitive elements is based on the analysis of existing methods for calculating elastic elements, new algorithms and modified methods for calculating. The proposed automated methods for analyzing the statics and dynamics of the element base under investigation are based both on analytical methods of the classical mechanics of elastically deformed bodies and on numerical methods for the purpose of exploiting their advantages and compensating for the weaknesses. For the development of automated design systems for annular elastic sensitive elements, mathematical modeling of deformation processes in a solid was carried out and an analysis of their characteristics was carried out using the modern ANSYS software complex on the basis of the finite element method. The mathematical model of the annular elastic sensitive element has a high degree of adequacy, low laboriousness with high productivity and low time costs. The software package is based on generating the most geometric model, as well as creating nodes and elements. When calculating the frequencies and forms of free oscillations, a modal analysis is used for linear systems. The solutions obtained were refined by means of harmonic analysis and analysis of transient processes. The article proposes a new approach to calculate and design the force-measuring membrane elastic element of the force sensor used in industrial scales with modern computer simulation methods. The reasons for the sensor error are described. The possibility of reducing the nonlinearity of the elastic characteristic and hysteresis due to the geometric nonlinearity and dry friction in the supports is considered. Rational geometric parameters of the elastic element were determined by the methods of finite element modeling, which make it possible to significantly reduce measurement errors. The research results are implemented in the practice of calculating and designing real structures. The results of the dynamic calculation were compared with the experimental data. For this purpose, were used the bar-and-pic chart of application of load of the elastic sensitive elements.

Compared with the AEs in the digital space, the physical adversarial attack is considered as a more severe threat to the applications like face recognition in authentication, objection detection in autonomous driving cars, etc. In particular, deceiving the object detectors practically, is more challenging since the relative position between the object and the detector may keep changing. Existing works attacking object detectors are still very limited in various scenarios, e.g., varying distance and angles, etc. In this paper, we presented systematic solutions to build robust and practical AEs against real world object detectors. Particularly, for Hiding Attack (HA), we proposed the feature-interference reinforcement (FIR) method and the enhanced realistic constraints generation (ERG) to enhance robustness, and for Appearing Attack (AA), we proposed the nested-AE, which combines two AEs together to attack object detectors in both long and short distance. We also designed diverse styles of AEs to make AA more surreptitious. Evaluation results show that our AEs can attack the state-of-the-art real-time object detectors (i.e., YOLO V3 and faster-RCNN) at the success rate up to 92.4% with varying distance from 1m to 25m and angles from −60◦ to 60◦1. Our AEs are also demonstrated to be highly transferable, capable of attacking another three state-of-the-art black-box models with high success rate. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, the USV roll motion at sea is a complex time-varying nonlinear and non-stationary dynamic system, which varies with time-varying environmental disturbances as well as various sailing conditions. The conventional methods have the disadvantages of low accuracy, poor robustness, and insufficient practical application ability. The rise of deep learning provides new opportunities for USV motion modeling and prediction. In this paper, a data-driven neural network model is constructed by combining a convolution neural network (CNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) for USV roll motion prediction. The CNN is used to extract spatially relevant and local time series features of the USV sensor data. The LSTM layer is exploited to reflect the long-term movement process of the USV and predict roll motion for the next moment. The fully connected layer is utilized to decode the LSTM output and calculate the final prediction results. The effectiveness of the proposed model was proved using USV roll motion prediction experiments based on two case studies from ""JingHai-VI"" and ""JingHai-III"" USVS of Shanghai University. Experimental results on a real data set indicated that our proposed model obviously outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

IoT devices such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be exploited in a variety of applications related to crops management, by capturing high spatial and temporal resolution images. These technologies are expected to revolutionize agriculture, enabling decision-making in days instead of weeks, promising significant reduction in cost and increase in the yield. Such decisions enable the effective application of farm inputs, supporting the four pillars of precision agriculture, i.e., apply the right practice, at the right place, at the right time and with the right quantity. However, the actual proliferation and exploitation of UAVs in Smart Farming has not been as robust as expected mainly due to the challenges confronted when selecting and deploying the relevant technologies, including the data acquisition and image processing methods. The main problem is that still there is no standardized workflow for the use of UAVs in such applications, as it is a relatively new area. In this article, we review the most recent applications of UAVs for Precision Agriculture. We discuss the most common applications, the types of UAVs exploited and then we focus on the data acquisition methods and technologies, appointing the benefits and drawbacks of each one.

This work defines for the first time and proposes a solution to the following problem: can one precisely estimate an autonomous vehicle's orientation relative to the road by taking a picture from within the vehicle? Vehicle orientation supplies crucial information for making various driving-related decisions. The key challenge of this problem is the lack of training data, since accurately annotating vehicle's orientation information in an image is in general difficult. To circumvent the data scarcity issue, we propose to leverage publicly-available street panoramas as those found in GoogleMaps. Street panoramas are essentially defined by 2-D plenoptic functions that map the visual environment to a sphere. One can thus effortlessly collect annotated data for the interested task by specifying a direction and reading out corresponding pixels from a panorama. This way we collect a city-scale large benchmark TB500K for studying this problem. Our second contribution is the exposition of a two-stream deep network for attacking this problem. Intuitively, visual/semantic and geometric (e.g., the direction of road lanes) cues are both crucial and complement each other. Our proposed two-stream network can jointly learn from both cues and serves as a reasonable baseline for this novel problem. In addition, several experiments are also conducted to reveal key factors in estimating the vehicle orientation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This technology had numerous application and one of it is in agriculture. Unlike tradition agriculture practiced that difficult to execute and required a large number of man power, implementing this technology will increase the production yield of the crops and improved the agriculture sector in managing and controlling. Remote sensing were able to forecast the crop production, identified the crop type, assess the crop damage and monitoring its progress. Therefore, this research was conducted in order to monitor the early stage of growth of rice crop planted by the farmers in the paddy field using remote sensing. To do so, popular empirical vegetation index known as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) generated from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was selected to monitor the changes of rice crop starting from the day it been planted until eleventh day of planted. Early stage of monitoring the crop growth using NDVI is a best approach to practice. Any damages that occur during this stage will affect the yield production and economy. Result from image analysis shown that NDVI were able to observe the rice crop growth and able to locate the damage part in the paddy plot.

The integration of positioning systems with navigational and propulsion control systems and the increasing reliance on Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for monitoring the ship's performance makes modern ships vulnerable to a wide range of cyber security issues. Moreover, frequent or permanent onshore connection makes the ship's communication network a potential target for cyber-criminals. Such attacks can incapacitate the vessel, i.e., through a ransomware attack, or greatly degrade the performance of the ship systems, i.e., causing delays in the propagation of control messages between critical components within the ship. Furthermore, crew members and marine engineers are challenged with the task of configuring security policies for networked devices, using low-level device specific syntax, which is an error prone and time consuming process. In addition to this, crew members must also be familiar with the specific syntax for low-level network management task, which exacerbates the problem. The emergence of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) helps reduce the complexity of the network management tasks and we believe that a similar approach may be used to address the larger problem. We therefore propose the CyberShip-IoT framework to provide a network level defense for the communication network component of ship systems. CyberShip-IoT offers a high-level policy language and a translation mechanism for automated policy enforcement in the ship's communication network. The modular design of the framework provides flexibility to deploy detection mechanism according to their requirements. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of this framework, we develop a prototype for a scenario involving the communication network of a typical ship. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework can effectively translate high-level security policies into OpenFlow rules of the switches without incurring much latency, ultimately leading to efficient attack mitigation and reduced collateral damage. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

On one hand, AVs offer the potential to reduce the urban space requirements for roads and parking, creating more space for high-quality, liveable areas. On the other hand, greater motorisation and the availability to perform leisure or work activities while travelling in AVs could increase the number of trips and travel distances, encouraging urban traffic congestion and sprawl. These diverse, and sometimes conflicting, estimates and opinions give rise to considerable uncertainty among urban policy decision-makers, sometimes leading to planning inaction. This paper aims to shed light on the opportunities that AVs offer in delivering attractive, healthy and sustainable urbanisation patterns. This paper employs a backcasting approach to investigate whether and how the potential impacts of AV implementation can support or threaten a range of urban development policy goals. This approach enables conflicts between policy goals to be identified. The findings point to the need for mixed-use development policy, the clustering of urban facilities and services, the restriction of motorized access in cities and the adoption of shared high-quality multimodal transport. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

The remarkable, 30-m annual fluctuation in the reservoir water level poses a significant threat to slope stability in this area. Four hundred sixty-two landslides were identified in the Zigui basin using historical records, satellite images, field investigations and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) observations, enabling the construction of a complete landslide database and distribution map. Three failure modes of landslides in the Zigui basin are used to illustrate the major factors that govern reservoir-induced landslides. The results show that (1) > 99% of identified landslides occur on slopes angle <47°, while >80% occur at elevations below 600 m; (2) Jurassic Niejiashan Formation is highly prone to landslides; (3) Low reservoir levels of 145 m to 155 m greatly reduce slope stability. Based on the information entropy method that use the conditional probability of different influencing factors and principal component analysis as inputs, the relative contributions of various influencing factors are quantified and a landslide susceptibility map was drawn. This susceptibility map helps define the countermeasures that will best reduce fatalities and property losses for areas having different landslide conditions and susceptibilities. © 2019","Article","Final","Scopus"

In particular, advanced sensorless control techniques of permanent magnet synchronous motors permit reduced costs, high reliability, and performances.

The objective of this paper is two-fold. The first is to build a dataset that is representative of the problem of classifying underwater coral images, the StructureRSMAS dataset. The second is to build a classifier capable of resolving the real problem of classifying corals, based either on texture or structure images. We have achieved this by using a two-level classifier composed of three ResNet models. The first level recognizes whether the input image is a texture or a structure image.

The correct functioning of these real-time systems is timing-critical with hard deadlines. However, although they interact with other systems and exchange inputs/outputs with the physical world, they usually lack security mechanisms, which makes them susceptible to a wide range of attacks with critical consequences. Typically, this is because security mechanisms usually violate the real-time requirements of these systems and cannot be adjusted at runtime to provide the adequate security without compromising performance. In this paper, we propose a consolidated runtime-configurable hardware-assisted security extension called CHASE that supports different levels of security at runtime. Depending on the desired security level and the system real-time, availability or functionality requirements, CHASE can be configured accordingly at runtime, thus enabling the calibration of the security vs. performance trade-off. We analyze CHASE's effectiveness in providing different security guarantees against various adversarial capabilities, and show how this is achieved with reasonable logic overhead and minimal performance overhead. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to propose this new paradigm, which is mainly aimed at providing significant information to the first responders, as follows: 1) generate immediate crisis maps for the disaster-impacted areas, called UE-Based Crisis Maps (UEBCMs), 2) provide vital information about where the majority of survivors are clustered/crowded and how (e.g., whether located indoor or outdoor). The UE-based SAROs offer the first responders a vital tool to prioritize/manage SAROs efficiently and effectively in a timely manner, supporting the largest number of disaster victims. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

These UAVs are very versatile and can be applied to several fields ranging from agriculture to military reconnaissance. Due to the immense functionality of the UAVs, it has now become a very popular topic in Research. With the advent of Deep Learning and Machine Learning the autonomous navigation functionalities have been improved but it still poses a challenge as navigating a drone involves the integration of its software and hardware functionalities. This paper reviews both indoor and outdoor navigation. Topics in navigation such as Control, Hardware, Algorithms, Path-Planning, and communication are touched upon in this paper. The paper also presents a discussion on the Navigation of UAVs using vision-based technologies, this technology encompasses the use of various sensors and cameras and integrate it with the navigation system of the UAV to ensure the success of UAV’s operation. UAVs play a pivotal role in networking, many applications have been developed which have UAVs as an important component in them. Their applications include Urban computing, Internet of Things, Ubiquitous Computing to name a few. Safely operating a UAV as a network node is not a simple task, these nodes are prone to various types of attacks. A new type of attack introduced in this paper is termed as “Coagulation Attack”. This attack gets its name from the coagulation property of fluids wherein fluids clot and their particles settle down. This paper explores the concept, issues, challenges and research aspects of Coagulation attack. This paper also introduces the concept of Underwater Wireless Communication. On a planet where 70% of the surface is covered in water, UWC has a lot of potentials to be exploited. Moreover UWC is critical in many key areas of Maritime research, commerce, and surveillance. UWC is used for experimental observation, data collection and analysis, underwater navigation, disaster prevention and early detection warning of a tsunami. In addition, we summarize emerging technologies in the UWC, future research directions and recommendations using fifth-generation (5G) communication techniques. © BEIESP.","Article","Final","Scopus"

In particular, autonomous vehicles may face moral dilemmas in accident scenarios, such as staying the course resulting in hurting pedestrians or swerving leading to hurting passengers. To investigate such ethical dilemmas, recent studies have adopted preference aggregation, in which each voter expresses her/his preferences over decisions for the possible ethical dilemma scenarios, and a centralized system aggregates these preferences to obtain the winning decision. Although a useful methodology for building ethical AI systems, such an approach can potentially violate the privacy of voters since moral preferences are sensitive information and their disclosure can be exploited by malicious parties resulting in negative consequences. In this paper, we report a first-of-its-kind privacy-preserving crowd-guided AI decision-making approach in ethical dilemmas. We adopt the formal and popular notion of differential privacy to quantify privacy, and consider four granularities of privacy protection by taking voter-/record-level privacy protection and centralized/distributed perturbation into account, resulting in four approaches VLCP, RLCP, VLDP, and RLDP, respectively. Moreover, we propose different algorithms to achieve these privacy protection granularities, while retaining the accuracy of the learned moral preference model. Specifically, VLCP and RLCP are implemented with the data aggregator setting a universal privacy parameter and perturbing the averaged moral preference to protect the privacy of voters' data. VLDP and RLDP are implemented in such a way that each voter perturbs her/his local moral preference with a personalized privacy parameter. Extensive experiments based on both synthetic data and real-world data of voters' moral decisions demonstrate that the proposed approaches achieve high accuracy of preference aggregation while protecting individual voter's privacy. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Through the measured inertial sensor readings, we can monitor the movement dynamics of the carrying platform in real-time, such as the platform's moving speed, displacement, and position. Unlike Global Positioning System (GPS), which shows severe accuracy degradation when GPS signals are weak (e.g., in indoor or urban environments), our system tracks the platform's movements and performs positioning without receiving external signals. Thus, our system can be an effective alternative approach to monitor the movement dynamics of those indoor objects (e.g., sweeping robot, indoor drone). Specifically, we exploit the motion-sensing capabilities of smartphone's inertial sensors to measure the carrying platform's movement dynamics. The inertial magnetometer of the smartphone allows us to reorient sensors with the cardinal directions; the gyroscope and accelerometer enable measuring the velocity and displacement of the platform.

The cars require detailed data about the environment on different levels to generate a comprehensive overview of the current traffic situation in real time to ensure their safe and secure movement. The availability, integrity, authenticity and accountability of data and its processing are a prerequisite for automated and interconnected driving. Additionally, confidentiality and privacy are main requirements for using C-ITS services. Cyber security is not only necessary for an efficient traffic management. Co-operative functions and coordinative autonomy is mandatory, since successful intentional attacks on a C-ITS in fact threaten human lives. There is a fundamental need for a comprehensive harmonization of safety and security aspects from the infrastructure provider's perspective to ensure awareness and trust - and not solely from an original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) view. Especially cyber security is essential to make these cooperative traffic structures and autonomous interconnected driving technologies confidently available to society.

One promising application is centralized intelligent intersection management, where an intersection manager accepts requests from approaching vehicles (via vehicle-to-infrastructure communication messages) and schedules the order for those vehicles to safely crossing the intersection. However, communication delays and packet losses may occur due to the unreliable nature of wireless communication or malicious security attacks (e.g., jamming and flooding), and could cause deadlocks and unsafe situations. In our previous work, we considered these issues and proposed a delay-tolerant intersection management protocol for intersections with a single lane in each direction. In this work, we address key challenges in efficiency and deadlock when there are multiple lanes from each direction, and propose a delay-tolerant protocol for general multi-lane intersection management. We prove that this protocol is deadlock free, safe, and satisfies the liveness property. Furthermore, we extend the traffic simulation suite SUMO with communication modules, implement our protocol in the extended simulator, and quantitatively analyze its performance with the consideration of communication delays. Finally, we also model systems that use smart traffic lights with various back-pressure scheduling methods in SUMO, including the basic back-pressure control, the capacity-aware back-pressure control, and the adaptive max-pressure control.We then compare our delay-tolerant intelligent intersection protocol with smart traffic lights that use the three back-pressure scheduling methods, in the case of a network of interconnected intersections. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significant outperforms the smart traffic lights under normal operation (i.e., when the communication delay is not too large). © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To address this problem, a tightly-coupled Ackermann visual-inertial odometry (ACK-MSCKF) is proposed to fuse Ackermann error state measurements and the Stereo Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (S-MSCKF) with a tightly-coupled filter-based mechanism. In contrast with S-MSCKF, in which the inertial measurement unit (IMU) propagates the vehicle motion and then the propagation is corrected by stereo visual measurements, we successively update the propagation with Ackermann error state measurements and visual measurements after the process model and state augmentation. This way, additional constraints from the Ackermann measurements are exploited to improve the pose estimation accuracy. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results evaluated under real-world datasets from an Ackermann steering vehicle lead to the following demonstration: ACK-MSCKF can significantly improve the pose estimation accuracy of S-MSCKF under the special motions of autonomous vehicles, and keep accurate and robust pose estimation available under different vehicle driving cycles and environmental conditions.

This pa-per proposes a novel hybrid method for S1 and S2 heart sound segmentation using group sparsity denoising and variation mode decomposition (VMD) technique. In the proposed method, the measured phonocardiogram (PCG) signals are denoised using group sparsity algorithm by exploiting the group sparse (GS) property of PCG signals. The denoised GS-PCG signals are then decomposed into subsequent modes with specific spectral characteristics using VMD algorithm. The appropriate mode for further processing is selected based on mode central frequencies and mode energy. It is then followed by the extraction of Hilbert envelope (HEnv) and a thresholding on the selected mode to segment S1 and S2 heart sounds. The performance advantage of the proposed method is verified using PCG signals from benchmark databases namely eGeneralMedical, Littmann, Washington, and Michigan. The proposed hybrid algorithm has achieved a sensitivity of 100%, positive predictivity of 98%, accuracy of 98% and detection error rate of 1.5%.

The Quantum bioreactor system offered by Terumo BCT represents a hollow-fiber platform integrating GMP-compliant manufacturing steps in a closed system for automated cultivation of cellular products. In the respective established protocols, the hollow fibers are coated with fibronectin and trypsin is used to harvest the final cell product, which in the case of DCs allows processing of only one tenth of an apheresis product. Materials and Results: We successfully developed a new protocol that circumvents the need for fibronectin coating and trypsin digestion, and makes the Quantum bioreactor system now suitable for generating large numbers of mature human monocyte-derived DCs (Mo-DCs) by processing a complete apheresis product at once. To achieve that, it needed a step-by-step optimization of DC-differentiation, e.g., the varying of media exchange rates and cytokine concentration until the total yield (% of input CD14+ monocytes), as well as the phenotype and functionality of mature Mo-DCs, became equivalent to those generated by our established standard production of Mo-DCs in cell culture bags. Conclusions: By using this new protocol for the Food and Drug Administration–approved Quantum system, it is now possible for the first time to process one complete apheresis to automatically generate large numbers of human Mo-DCs, making it much more feasible to exploit the potential of individualized DC-based immunotherapy. © 2019 International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy","Article","Final","Scopus"

For the avionics cloud architecture of UAV swarm, how to distribute the cloud combat mission to the UAV and ensure the punctuality of mission completion is the key. Based on the hierarchical clustering network structure and module-level resource virtualization of UAV swarm, this paper improves the traditional single-layer platform-level task scheduling model, and proposes a multi-layer task scheduling model that is refined to the module level. The mission is scheduled from the cloud to the UAV function module. OMNeT++ is used to simulate the multi-layer mission scheduling model of UAV swarm and the traditional single-layer task scheduling model. The cloud uses the attack mission group as an example to construct the mission group for allocation and performance comparison of task throughput, message average end-to-end delay, and task completion time. The simulation results show that compared with the platform-level single-layer task scheduling, the module-level multi-task scheduling model reduces the average completion time of a single task by 46. 2% and the mission group completion time by 52. 1%. In addition to guarantee of throughput, the model proposed has more stable scheduling capability for complex tasks. In terms of network performance, the module-level multi-layer task scheduling model has lower end-to-end delay and more concentrated delay distribution, which improves the real-time performance of network message transmission. © 2019, Press of Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.

With this in mind, we develop an approach for modeling the interaction between autonomous and human-driven (or perhaps other autonomous) vehicles via game theory and assess the time evolution of potential collision paths via a reachability analysis of the solution set of a simple hybrid dynamical system that captures the kinematics of the lane-change process. We further utilize a control strategy based on model predictive control to develop a safety-assured motion profile on the part of the subject vehicle. This model is subsequently evaluated in multiple simulation scenarios as a function of a programmable safety assurance parameter. We should emphasize that the proposed approach is proactive in its outlook, as it considers a temporal horizon spanning several seconds and assumes a certain behavioral consistency on the part of the local traffic participants. As such it must be augmented with an appropriate reactive collision mitigation scheme that responds to immediate threats caused by abrupt behaviors that are not predictable via algorithmic schemes. Nevertheless, the scenarios studied here appear to produce intuitively reasonable behaviors that seem consistent with ordinary driving and highlight the prospects of this approach being implemented in autonomous driving strategies. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Transmitting and storing large amounts of such fine-grained data is however expensive, which makes compression schemes necessary in practice. Time series streams that are transmitted together often share properties or evolve together, making them significantly correlated. Despite the rich literature on compression methods, the state-of-the-art approaches do not typically avail correlation information when compressing times series. In this work, we demonstrate how one can leverage the correlation across several related time series streams to both drastically improve the compression efficiency and reduce the accuracy loss.We present a novel compression algorithm for time series streams called CORAD (CORelation-Aware compression of time series streams based on sparse Dictionary coding). Based on sparse dictionary learning, CORAD has the unique ability to exploit the correlation across multiple related time series to eliminate redundancy and perform a more efficient compression. To ensure the accuracy of the compressed time series, we further introduce a method to threshold the information loss of the compression. Extensive validation on real-world datasets shows that CORAD drastically outperforms state-of-the-art approaches achieving up to 40:1 compression ratios while minimizing the information loss. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In additive manufacturing (AM), the component construction is done solely by a digitally controlled layer-by-layer material application, without mold construction or forming processes. This represents a paradigm shift to the still predominantly manual shaping construction processes. In order to fully exploit the potential of AM structural design, material behavior and manufacturing processes must be integratively aligned. This enables buildings with a high degree of design freedom and resource-efficient use of materials. At the Institute of Structural Design (ITE) and at the Institute of Building Materials, Concrete Construction and Fire Safety (iBMB) at the Technische Universität Braunschweig, research has been carried out for several years into processes for the 3-D printing of large-format concrete components. The so-called Shotcrete 3-D Printing (SC3DP) technology was developed in an interdisciplinary research project. The SC3DP technology is an automated robotic, additive manufacturing process that builds up concrete components layer by layer with the controlled addition of compressed air. This report presents the first 3-D-printed and reinforced concrete components that demonstrate the potential of SC3DP. © 2019, Ernst und Sohn. All rights reserved.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Most existing papers for ECO-ACC focus on a shortsighted control scheme. A two-level control framework for longsighted ECO-ACC was only recently introduced [1]. However, that work is based on a deterministic traffic signal phase and timing (SPaT) over the entire route. In practice, connectivity with traffic lights may be limited by communication range, e.g. just one upcoming traffic light. We propose a two-level receding-horizon control framework for long-sighted ECO-ACC that exploits deterministic SPaT for the upcoming traffic light, and utilizes historical SPaT for other traffic lights within a receding control horizon. We also incorporate a powertrain control mechanism to enhance PHEV energy prediction accuracy.

Most registration approaches take the directly georeferenced LiDAR point cloud as a rigid body, based on the assumption that the high-precision positioning and orientation system (POS) in the LiDAR system provides sufficient precision, and that the POS errors are negligible. However, due to the large errors of the low-precision POSs commonly used in the low-cost UAV LiDAR systems (ULSs), dramatic deformation may exist in the directly georeferenced ULS point cloud, resulting in non-rigid transformation between the images and the deformed ULS point cloud. As a result, registration may fail when using a rigid transformation between the images and the directly georeferenced LiDAR point clouds. To address this problem, we proposed NRLI-UAV, which is a non-rigid registration method for registration of sequential raw laser scans and images collected by low-cost UAV systems. NRLI-UAV is a two-step registration method that exploits trajectory correction and discrepancy minimization between the depths derived from structure from motion (SfM) and the raw laser scans to achieve LiDAR point cloud quality improvement. Firstly, the coarse registration procedure utilizes global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU)-aided SfM to obtain accurate image orientation and corrects the errors of the low-precision POS. Secondly, the fine registration procedure transforms the original 2D-3D registration to 3D-3D registration. This is performed by setting the oriented images as the reference, and iteratively minimizing the discrepancy between the depth maps derived from SfM and the raw laser scans, resulting in accurate registration between the images and the LiDAR point clouds. In addition, an improved LiDAR point cloud is generated in the mapping frame. Experiments were conducted with data collected by a low-cost UAV system in three challenging scenes to evaluate NRLI-UAV. The final registration errors of the images and the LiDAR point cloud are less than one pixel in image space and less than 0.13 m in object space. The LiDAR point cloud quality was also evaluated by plane fitting, and the results show that the LiDAR point cloud quality is improved by 8.8 times from 0.45 m (root-mean-square error [RMSE] of plane fitting) to 0.05 m (RMSE of plane fitting) using NRLI-UAV, demonstrating a high level of automation, robustness, and accuracy. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The smart city concept aims to address these challenges by exploiting large scale deployments of Internet of Things (IoT) and communication technologies. These technologies generate data that provide quantifiable insights into the state of the infrastructure within a city. Using these insights, cities can more effectively allocate resources, manage services, and enhance the lives of its citizens. The data generated by smart cities is complex and requires high throughput. Advanced data integration platforms must support city-wide data collection, analysis, and storage. These systems must provide features that allow them to scale alongside the growth of the cities to support high rates of data ingestion in large volumes. Additionally, these systems must support low latency response times which is a critical requirement for time sensitive smart city applications. In this paper, we introduce a smart city testbed that will provide a real-world testing environment for applications in areas such as intelligent transportation, pedestrian safety, and autonomous vehicles. The proposed testbed will act as an open platform for researchers and developers to test new sensors, algorithms and more in a live urban environment, allowing them to test before deploying a product or application.

User devices are assumed capable of splitting their transmission power in two different communication alternatives, established via either the UAV or the macro base station (MBS). The bandwidth offered by the UAV is accessible by everyone, delivers potentially higher rate of return taking into account the enhanced communication channel gains owing to its proximity to the serving users, but is prone to failure due to its potential over-exploitation. Accordingly, the UAV’s bandwidth is considered as common pool of resources (CPR). In contrast, the MBS’s bandwidth is considered as a safe resource offering to the users a more limited but guaranteed level of service, due to the fact that though it has less available bandwidth it operates under a more controlled access scheme. The theory of the tragedy of the commons is used to capture the probability of failure of the CPR, while the prospect theory is adopted to study the normal and malicious users’ risk-aware behavior in the UAV-assisted network. A non-cooperative power control game among the users is formulated and solved, in order to determine the users’ power investment to the dual communication environment. The existence and uniqueness of a Pure Nash Equilibrium point is shown and a distributed algorithm is introduced to converge to the PNE point. This overall resource allocation framework is intelligently exploited as the vehicle to detect malicious user behavior and therefore protect the network from the undesired effects of such behaviors. The performance and inherent attributes of the proposed user-centric risk-aware operation framework, in terms of its capability to effectively utilize the available system and user resources (i.e., bandwidth and power), while succeeding in identifying potential abnormal or malicious user behaviors is assessed via modeling and simulation, under different operation scenarios. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, traditional autonomous vehicles’ behavioral decisions face consistency issues between behavioral decision and trajectory planning and shows a strong dependence on the human experience. In this paper, we present a planning-feature-based deep behavior decision method (PFBD) for autonomous driving in complex, dynamic traffic. We used a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) learning framework with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3) to exploit the optimal policy. We took into account the features of topological routes in the decision making of autonomous vehicles, through which consistency between decision making and path planning layers can be guaranteed. Specifically, the features of a route extracted from path planning space are shared as the input states for the behavioral decision. The actor-network learns a near-optimal policy from the feasible and safe candidate emulated routes. Simulation tests on three typical scenarios have been performed to demonstrate the performance of the learning policy, including the comparison with a traditional rule-based expert algorithm and the comparison with the policy considering partial information of a contour. The results show that the proposed approach can achieve better decisions. Real-time test on an HQ3 (HongQi the third) autonomous vehicle also validated the effectiveness of PFBD. © 2019, MDPI AG.

Hierarchical motion planning frameworks, which combine path planning with path parameterization, are popular due to their time efficiency. However, the path planning cannot properly deal with nonstatic initial states of the quadrotor, which may result in nonsmooth or even dynamically infeasible trajectories. In this article, we present an efficient kinodynamic replanning framework by exploiting the advantageous properties of the B-spline, which facilitates dealing with the nonstatic state and guarantees safety and dynamical feasibility. Our framework starts with an efficient B-spline-based kinodynamic (EBK) search algorithm, which finds a feasible trajectory with minimum control effort and time. To compensate for the discretization induced by the EBK search, an elastic optimization approach is proposed to refine the control point placement to the optimal location.

However, due to the complexity of the rotor flow field of the rotor UAV and the operating environment of the UAV, digital simulation is associated with a large workload and great computational costs. It is urgent to explore new models using deep learning to identify the law of the rotor flow field. To address this problem, deep learning, in combination with flow field methods, is used to explore new models in this paper.

Because of the lambda-shape planform and associated flow phenomena including shocks and vortices, the aerodynamic design process relies heavily on high-fidelity predictions from computational fluid dynamics (CFD). These simulations enable accurate flight dynamics predictions, allowing for the identification of any potential performance issues early in the design process. Potentially, a complete flight dynamics model can be derived from CFD calculations provided that the underlying reduced order model (ROM) captures the underlying physics contained within the CFD results. This work investigates the creation of a nonlinear ROM using indicial response functions. The response functions are obtained using a grid motion approach that separates the effects of angle of attack and pitch rate. This approach is demonstrated using three different CFD codes from various organizations: ENSOLV at Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre, USM3D at NASA Langley Research Center, and Kestrel at the United States Air Force Academy. ROM predictions were generated for a manoeuver resembling a low-speed pull-up. The predictions are found to be sensitive to the quality of the steady-state solutions from which step-response calculations were started, as well as the convergence of the step responses themselves. Nevertheless, the indicial response method is shown to provide aerodynamic predictions with acceptable accuracy including transient effects, and as such is a promising method for computationally efficient flight dynamics predictions. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Article","Final","Scopus"

The controller area network (CAN) protocol is used for communication between in-vehicle control networks (IVN). The absence of basic security features of this protocol, like message authentication, makes it quite vulnerable to a wide range of attacks including spoofing attacks. As traditional cybersecurity methods impose limitations in ensuring confidentiality and integrity of transmitted messages via CAN, a new technique has emerged among others to approve its reliability in fully authenticating the CAN messages. At the physical layer of the communication system, the method of fingerprinting the messages is implemented to link the received signal to the transmitting electronic control unit (ECU). This paper introduces a new method to implement the security of modern electric vehicles. The lumped element model is used to characterize the channel-specific step response. ECU and channel imperfections lead to a unique transfer function for each transmitter. Due to the unique transfer function, the step response for each transmitter is unique. In this paper, we use control system parameters as a feature-set, afterward, a neural network is used transmitting node identification for message authentication.

Most of the vehicles today possess hundreds of sensors. In Autonomous vehicles (AVs) exchanging a large amount of data (messages) will take place concurrently. In the USA, AVs communicate by means of The Dedicated Short-Range Communications protocol (DSRC). The (DSRC) establish V2V communication by utilizing four 6 Mbps communications channels. The problem occurs when the four channels operate simultaneously. The problem is that Blockchain is required in order to achieve secured V2V communication. The Blockchain is based on the standard hash function SHA-256. The SHA-256 which represent one of the SHA-2 family digests shares its mathematical model with SHA-1. However SHA-1 was vulnerable to collision attacks, therefore, SHA-256 will suffer from the same problem. Executing a simulation of SHA-3 (256) revealed an average speed of 3 Mbps, which is not sufficient to operate the Blockchain on V2V communication using DSRC. Generally, The Blockchain is software implemented for secure V2V communication. The hash function of Blockchain is compulsory to verify data integrity during V2V and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication. In this paper, a new family of hash functions is proposed based on the Unpredictability principle. The objective is to realize collision resistant and high speed with low computational overhead using one round of (AES-256). The suggested hash functions with the following output values (256, 384, and 512) and with speed (80, 160, and 240) Mbps respectively ensures the secure operation of the DSRC. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Such functionality exposes CAVs to new attacks that current vehicles will not face. To ensure the safety and security of CAVs, it is important to be able to identify theways inwhich the systemcould be attacked and to build defences against these attacks. One possible approach is to use reference architectures to perform an attack surface analysis. Existing research has developed a variety of reference architectures but none for the specific purpose of attack surface analysis. Existing approaches are either too simple for sufficiently detailed modelling or require too many details to be specified to easily analyse a CAV's attack surface. Therefore, we propose a reference architecture using a hybrid Functional-Communication viewpoint for attack surface analysis of CAVs, including the Devices, Edge and Cloud systems CAVs interact with. Using two case studies, we demonstrate how attack trees can be used to understand the attack surface of CAV systems. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Most existing studies apply low spatial resolution satellite images for crop distribution mapping, even in areas with a fragmented landscape. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery provides an alternative imagery source for crop mapping, yet its spectral resolution is usually lower than satellite images. In order to produce more accurate maps without losing any spatial heterogeneity (e.g., the physical boundary of land parcel), this study fuses Sentinel-2A and UAV images to map crop distribution at a finer spatial scale (i.e., land parcel scale) in an experimental site with various cropping patterns in Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China. Using a random forest algorithm, the original, as well as the fused images, are classified into 10 categories: rice, corn, soybean, buckwheat, other vegetations, greenhouses, bare land, water, roads and houses. In addition, we test the effect of UAV image choice by fusing Sentinel-2A with different UAV images at multiples spatial resolutions: 0.03 m, 0.10 m, 0.50 m, 1.00 m and 3.00 m. Overall, the fused images achieved higher classification accuracies, ranging between 10.58% and 16.39%, than the original images. However, the fused image based on the finest UAV image (i.e., 0.03 m) does not result in the highest accuracy. Instead, the 0.10 m spatial resolution UAV image produced the most accurate map. When the spatial resolution is less than 0.10 m, accuracy decreases gradually as spatial resolution decreases. The results of this paper not only indicate the possibility of combining satellite images and UAV images for land parcel level crop mapping for fragmented landscapes, but it also implies a potential scheme to exploit optimal choice of spatial resolution in fusing UAV images and Sentinel-2A, with little to no adverse side-effects. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To cost–effectively monitor the temporal and spatial damages in pine–oak mixed stands using unmanned aerial systems (UASs) for multispectral imagery, we aimed at developing a simple thresholding classification tool for forest practitioners as an alternative method to complex classifiers such as Random Forest. The UAS flights were performed during winter 2017–2018 over four study areas in Catalonia, northeastern Spain. To detect defoliation and further distinguish pine species, we conducted nested histogram thresholding analyses with four UAS-derived vegetation indices (VIs) and evaluated classification accuracy. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and NDVI red edge performed the best for detecting defoliation with an overall accuracy of 95% in the total study area. For discriminating pine species, accuracy results of 93–96% were only achievable with green NDVI in the partial study area, where the Random Forest classification combined for defoliation and tree species resulted in 91–93%. Finally, we achieved to estimate the average thresholds of VIs for detecting defoliation over the total area, which may be applicable across similar Mediterranean pine stands for monitoring regional forest health on a large scale. © 2019 by the authors.

For the high-level discrete state transitions, the shared information is used to determine when to change lane, if lane changing will bring reward for the autonomous vehicle and there exists a feasible continuous state controller. For the low-level continuous state space controller generation, the shared information can relax the safety interval constraints in the existing model predictive control method.

A prerequisite for path planning is to have a comprehensive understanding of the 3D structure of the robot's environment. On Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) this is commonly achieved using low-cost sensors, such as stereo or RGB-D cameras. These sensors may fail to provide depth measurements in textureless or IR-absorbing areas and have limited effective range. In path planning, this results in inefficient trajectories or failure to recognize a feasible path to the goal, hence significantly impairing the robot's mobility. Recent advances in deep learning enables us to exploit prior experience about the shape of the world and hence to infer complete depth maps from color images and additional sparse depth measurements. In this work, we present an augmented planning system and investigate the effects of employing state-of-the-art depth completion techniques, specifically trained to augment sparse depth maps originating from RGB-D sensors, semi-dense methods and stereo matchers. We extensively evaluate our approach in online path planning experiments based on simulated data, as well as global path planning experiments based on real world Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) data. We show that our augmented system, provided with only sparse depth perception, can reach on-par performance to ground truth depth input in simulated online planning experiments.

To optimally process assigned tasks, each UAV requires prompt and ubiquitous information provisioning regarding the varying operation conditions, which renders exploiting base stations (BSs) of existing wireless infrastructures a tractable solution. To receive services from a BS, a UAV should stay within the coverage area of a BS, which however limits the operation range of a UAV. This obstacle thus drives the deployment of a special sort of UAV, known as an aerial base station (ABS), to relay signals between a BS and a UAV. Based on different flight paths of UAVs, an ABS should autonomously decide its own flight trajectory so as to maximize the number of UAVs which can receive wireless services. However, the inherently non-stationary environment renders the optimum autonomous deployment of an ABS a challenging issue. Inspired by the merit of interacting with the environment, we consequently propose a reinforcement learning scheme to optimize the flight trajectory of an ABS. To eliminate the engineering concern in the conventional Q-learning scheme that most state-action pairs may not be fully visited in the deployment of an ABS, in this paper, a state-amount-reduction (SAR) k-step Q-learning scheme is proposed to avoid the issue in the conventional Q-learning, so as to maximize the number of UAVs receiving services from an ABS. Through providing analytical foundations and simulation studies, outstanding performance of the proposed schemes is demonstrated as compared with that of the conventional reinforcement learning based ABS deployment. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In recent years, relevant research has focused on subjects such as energy and economic, environmental pollution and health issues. Yet this has not considered the use of water resources and the impact of wastewater pollutant emissions on the economy and health. This article has combined the following factors like water consumption with wastewater discharge, pollutant concentration in sewage and local medical care expenditure and put them into the model of water resources, energy and health measurement, and a two-stage dynamic data envelopment analysis (DEA) model considering undesirable outputs is applied to 30 provinces (including autonomous regions and municipalities) to calculate the total efficiency, production efficiency and health efficiency in 2014–2017.The results show that the total efficiency values of most provinces are between 0.2 and 0.4, providing large room for improvement. Production efficiency and health efficiency have increased in recent years, but the health efficiency values of most provinces are still so low that they have dragged back the overall efficiency. The key impact indicators of different provinces are different, and each province should formulate different policies according to its own specific conditions so as to purposefully to deepen the energy, economic and medical reforms in each province, and also to promote sustainable economic development while improving health efficiency. © 2019 by the authors.

Although existing research recognizes the importance of trust, there is a lack of an effective and scalable computational method to measure trust in an OSS community. Consequently, OSS project members must rely on subjective inferences based on fragile and incomplete information for trust-related decision making. We propose an automated approach to assist a developer in identifying the trustworthiness of another developer. Our two-fold approach, first, computes direct trust between developer pairs who have interacted previously by analyzing their interactions via natural language processing. Second, we infer indirect trust between developers who have not interacted previously by constructing a community-wide developer network and propagating trust in the network. A large-scale evaluation of our approach on a GitHub dataset consisting of 24,315 developers shows that contributions from trusted developers are more likely to be accepted to a project compared to contributions from developers who are distrusted or lacking trust from project members. Further, we develop a pull request classifier that exploits trust metrics to effectively predict the likelihood of a pull request being accepted to a project, demonstrating the practical utility of our approach. © 2019 Sapkota et al.

Despite the virtues of UAVs in disaster response applications, various limitations (e.g., requiring manual input, finite battery life) hinder their mass adoption. In contrast, social sensing is emerging as a new sensing paradigm that utilizes signals provided by 'human sensors' to gather awareness of the events occurring in the physical world. Despite being inherently broader in scope, a shortcoming of social sensing is the reliability of the sensing data that are contributed by humans. In this paper, we introduce the concept of jointly exploiting the reliability of drones and the scope of social sensing to efficiently uncover the truthful events during disasters. However, such a tight integration of social and physical sensing introduces several technical challenges. The first challenge is satisfying the conflicting objectives of event coverage of the application and energy conservation of drones. The second challenge is adapting to the dynamics of the physical world and social media. In this paper, we present a Social-media-driven Energy-Aware Drone (SEAD) sensing framework to address the above challenges. In particular, we develop a reinforcement learning-based drone dispatching scheme that adapts to the physical and social environments and launches an appropriate proportion of drones for event exploration. We further utilize a bottom-up game-Theoretic task allocation approach to guide drones effectively to the event locations. The evaluation with a real-world disaster case study show that SEAD noticeably outperforms state-of-The-Art baselines in terms of detection effectiveness and energy efficiency. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The tested methods, in general, were divided into three groups: the preliminary filtering and image preparation, the logical processing of the results of the filtering and—machine learning which in general are divided into three groups. The filtering that allows highlighting of images in the recognition area, linearization, the transformation of “Hafa” and filtering contours as a separate class of filters were selected as the main methods of filtering images.

This scenario is of interest in case multilateration-based alternatives would require the deployment of many receivers and imply exceedingly high costs, e.g., for the coverage of wide areas. The proposed method exploits the knowledge of environmental parameters such as the sound speed profile, bathymetry and bottom sediments in order to estimate the location of the AUV, taking advantage of the spatial dependency of channel impulse responses that arises from the diverse bathymetry around the receiver. This dependency is captured by comparing channel estimates against a database of channel responses, pre-computed through an acoustic propagation model. This yields multiple likely AUV locations, which are filtered via a path tracking method similar to the Viterbi algorithm, in order to estimate the trajectory of the AUV. Results obtained both from simulations and from a sea experiment show that the proposed method can estimate node locations and paths with a small error, especially considering the use of a single receiver. © 2019 Acoustical Society of America.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Using details about US-Pakistan counterterrorism cooperation and geocoded violence data, we show that the program was associated with monthly reductions of around nine to thirteen insurgent attacks and fifty-one to eighty-six casualties in the area affected by the program. This change was sizable, as in the year before the program, the affected area experienced around twenty-one attacks and one hundred casualties per month. Additional quantitative and qualitative evidence suggests that this drop is attributable to the drone program. However, the damage caused in strikes during the program cannot fully account for the reduction. Instead, anticipatory effects induced by the program played a prominent role in subduing violence. These effects stemmed from the insurgents' perception of the risk of being targeted in drone strikes; their efforts to avoid targeting severely compromised their movement and communication abilities, in addition to eroding within-group trust. These findings contrast with prominent perspectives on air-power, counterinsurgency, and US counterterrorism, suggesting select drone deployments can be an effective tool of counterinsurgency and counterterrorism. © The Author(s) (2019).

However, since the input information for the discretionary lane change problem is continuous and can be in high dimension, it is an open challenge for DRL to optimize the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Conventional model-less exploration methods lack a systematic way to incorporate additional engineering or model-based knowledge of our application into consideration and as a result, the training can be inefficient and may dwell on a policy, e.g. lane change strategy that is impractical. In previous related work, many used the rule-based safety check policy to guide the exploration and collect input information data. However, it is not guaranteed to get the optimal policy and the performance is dependent on the safety check policy selected. In this paper, we developed an explicit statistical aggregated environment model using a conditional variational auto-encoder and a model-based exploration strategy leveraging it. The agent is guided to explore with surprise-based intrinsic reward derived from the environment model. The result is compared with annealing epsilon-greedy exploration and with rule-based safety check exploration. We demonstrate that the performance of the developed model-based exploration method is comparable with the best rule-based safety check exploration and much better than the epsilon-greedy exploration. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This algorithm adopts a distributed architecture where each UAV is considered as an ant and makes decision autonomously. At each decision step, the ants choose the next gird according to the state transition rule and update its own artificial potential field and pheromone map based on the current search results. Through iterations of this process, the cooperative search of UAV swarm for mission area is realized. The state transition rule is divided into two types. If the artificial potential force is larger than a threshold, the deterministic transition rule is adopted, otherwise a heuristic transition rule is used. The deterministic transition rule can ensure UAVs to avoid the threat or approach the target quickly. And the heuristics transition rule considering the pheromone and heuristic information ensures the continuous search of area with the goal of covering more unknown area and finding more targets. Finally, simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ACOAPF algorithm for cooperative search mission of UAV swarm. © 2019, Editorial Department of Transactions of NUAA.

The convolutional neural network (CNN) is the state-of-the-art technique for many machine learning tasks in the image and video processing domains. Deployment of CNNs on embedded systems with lower processing power and smaller power budget is a challenging task. Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) as a hardware accelerator for the CNNs that can deliver high performance at low power budgets. Majority of computations in CNNs involve 2-D convolution. Winograd minimal filtering-based algorithm is the most efficient technique for calculating convolution for smaller filter sizes. CNNs also consist of fully connected layers that are computed using general element-wise matrix multiplication (GEMM). In this article, we propose a unified architecture named UniWiG, where both Winograd-based convolution and GEMM can be accelerated using the same set of processing elements. This approach leads to efficient utilization of FPGA hardware resources while computing all layers in the CNN. The proposed architecture shows performance improvement in the range of 1.4× to 4.02× with only 13% additional FPGA resources with respect to the baseline GEMM-based architecture. We have mapped popular CNN models like AlexNet and VGG-16 onto the proposed accelerator and the measured performance compares favorably with other state-of-the-art implementations. We have also analyzed the vulnerability of the accelerator to the side-channel attacks. Preliminary investigations show that the UniWiG architecture is more robust to memory side-channel attacks than direct convolution-based techniques. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

It targeted the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) and the bomb toppled its building, killed 85 and hurt over 300 people. The Supreme Court ordered DFPS/SHDG to carry out the identification of the fragmented remains by means of DNA analysis. At that time five VNTRs, seven STRs including five autosomal, one X, and one on the Y chromosome, mtDNA sequencing (HVR I and II) and MVR were used. The techniques used were all manual, southern blot and polyacrylamide gels with radioactive probes or primer detection. The first report was presented on November 7, 1994. In addition to the molecular data, identifications were made using conventional forensic criteria: dactyloscopy, radiography, dentistry and personal traits. In July 2016, the AMIA Investigative Investigation Unit wanted to clarify the identity of additional victims and asked the DFPS/SHDG and as a second opinion laboratory the Argentine team of Forensic Anthropology (EAAF), to analyze samples in parallel, compare them to the results reported in 1994, and perform additional tests on samples not previously analyzed by DNA typing. Both laboratories used automated platforms (ABI 3500); commercial kits Powerplex Fusion, Identifiler and mtDNA sequencing. Although TH01 and vWA are the only tested STR markers in 1994 that are still in use, most results reported in 1994 were confirmed by both laboratories. Additionally, it was possible to identify a victim whose material had initially been analyzed but, given its state of degradation, it had not been possible to obtain a genetic profile. The use of more sensitive megaplexes made it possible to identify a missing person 23 years later. The overall results demonstrate the robustness of the DNA analyses and the great increase in the sensitivity of the new analytical systems used and underscore the importance of including a second opinion lab to warrant the quality of the results. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

To decouple these design goals, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based scheme in conjunction with the balanced Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) transmit power allocation is proposed. Exploiting the closed-form expressions of the SINR-balanced optimal power allocation and the resulting SINR, the proposed PSO-based scheme optimizes the UAV location generation by generation.

Among various enabling technologies for UAVs, wireless communication is essential and has drawn significantly growing attention in recent years. Compared to the conventional terrestrial communications, UAVs' communications face new challenges due to their high altitude above the ground and great flexibility of movement in the 3-D space. Several critical issues arise, including the line-of-sight (LoS) dominant UAV-ground channels and induced strong aerial-terrestrial network interference, the distinct communication quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for UAV control messages versus payload data, the stringent constraints imposed by the size, weight, and power (SWAP) limitations of UAVs, as well as the exploitation of the new design degree of freedom (DoF) brought by the highly controllable 3-D UAV mobility. In this article, we give a tutorial overview of the recent advances in UAV communications to address the above issues, with an emphasis on how to integrate UAVs into the forthcoming fifth-generation (5G) and future cellular networks. In particular, we partition our discussion into two promising research and application frameworks of UAV communications, namely UAV-assisted wireless communications and cellular-connected UAVs, where UAVs are integrated into the network as new aerial communication platforms and users, respectively. Furthermore, we point out promising directions for future research. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Nonetheless, the recent plethora of DNN model compression techniques have successfully overcome this limit, turning into a reality that DNN-based inference can be run on numerous resource-constrained edge devices including mobile phones, drones, robots, medical devices, wearables, Internet of Things devices, among many others. Naturally, edge devices are highly heterogeneous in terms of hardware specification and usage scenarios. On the other hand, compressed DNN models are so diverse that they exhibit different tradeoffs in a multi-dimension space, and not a single model can achieve optimality in terms of all important metrics such as accuracy, latency and energy consumption. Consequently, how to automatically select a compressed DNN model for an edge device to run inference with optimal quality of experience (QoE) arises as a new challenge. The state-of-the-art approaches either choose a common model for all/most devices, which is optimal for a small fraction of edge devices at best, or apply device-specific DNN model compression, which is not scalable. In this paper, by leveraging the predictive power of machine learning and keeping end users in the loop, we envision an automated device-level DNN model selection engine for QoE-optimal edge inference. To concretize our vision, we formulate the DNN model selection problem into a contextual multi-armed bandit framework, where features of edge devices and DNN models are contexts and pre-trained DNN models are arms selected online based on the history of actions and users' QoE feedback. We develop an efficient online learning algorithm to balance exploration and exploitation. Our preliminary simulation results validate our algorithm and highlight the potential of machine learning for automating DNN model selection to achieve QoE-optimal edge inference. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

However, manual segmentation of the numerous scans is time consuming, tedious and error-prone. Fortunately, machine learning-based automated approaches for image segmentation tasks are becoming more common. However, poor performance of these methods can result from a lack of quantity or diversity in the data used to train the models. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated the ability to generate synthetic images, which may be useful for data augmentation purposes. Here, we propose the application of GANs to construct chorio-retinal patches from OCT images which may be used to augment data for a patch-based approach to boundary segmentation. Given the complexity of GAN training, a range of experiments are performed to optimize performance. We show that it is feasible to generate 32×32 versions of such patches that are visually indistinguishable from their real variants. In the best case, the segmentation performance utilizing solely synthetic data to train the model is nearly comparable to real data on all three layer boundaries of interest. The difference in mean absolute error for the inner boundary of the inner limiting membrane (ILM) [0.50 vs. 0.48 pixels], outer boundary of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) [0.48 vs. 0.44 pixels] and choroid-scleral interface (CSI) [4.42 vs. 4.00 pixels] shows the performance using synthetic data to be only marginally inferior.

Considering the limited cruising duration of the UAV, multiple rechargeable UAVs are capable of constructing a closed chain for the sake of alternately supporting IoT nodes. Moreover, a joint IoT node assignment and UAV configuration optimization problem is proposed in order to maximize the energy efficiency of the system. Since the proposed problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex problem, we divide it into three subproblems, namely, node assignment scheduling, UAV trajectory planning, and transmit power control. By exploiting sequential convex optimization techniques, we reformulate the nonconvex subproblems into three convex optimization problems which can be solved within the polynomial time.

In this paper, we use a multi-class CTM to capture the interaction between the controlled vehicles and the background traffic. Exploiting the nonlinear nature of the model, we are able to first collect enough controlled vehicles into an area, and then use them to actuate the rest of the traffic by acting as a controlled moving bottleneck.

Achieving accurate vehicle state is a challenging task in those applications due to the noise disturbances. Recent studies suggest that noise is not generally Gaussian distributed and many physical environments can be handled more accurately as non-Gaussian rather than Gaussian model. Inspired by this observation, we strive to improve the vehicle state estimation by investigating the effects of that assumption when process and measurement noises are non-Gaussian distributed. Here, process noise represents the noise during the state information processing. To that end, we exploit the generalized error distribution (GED) to compute the non-Gaussian probability density during the vehicle state estimation. We then derive extensive theoretical analysis targeting to estimate the parameters such as the mean and the variance (or covariance matrix) related to both process and measurement noises and reduce the computational burden of the distribution. Further, we propose a non-Gaussian particle filter for vehicle state estimation ( nGPF-VSE) algorithm wherein we utilize the genetic operator resampling (GOR) technique to enhance the efficiency of particle filter (PF) relying on the selection of the importance sampling distribution. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we conduct numerical simulations on the popular system of state-space equations and a real experiment for estimating the vehicle state.

In complex traffic, it is difficult for drivers to safely share the road with other vehicles and pedestrians while avoiding water puddles and pot holes. Running into these could potentially damage electronic components and corrode metal parts of the car, or even lead to loss of control. Similarly, driver-less cars also need to detect water puddles and plan safe path around them or slow down if it deems to be safe to do so. Such detection needs to be both accurate and fast enough for realtime assistance or planning. We present a new temporal 3D fully convolutional network called T3D-FCN for water detection that exploit temporal information to achieve accuracy comparable to the-state-of-the-art accuracy while requires less computation resources. We also show that by adding temporal information the detection performance significantly improves with a small additional computation as compared to single image detection using a similar network architecture. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

One popular IoT platform is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drone). Benefiting from the intrinsic flexibility, convenience, and low cost, UAVs have great potentials to be utilized in various civil applications, including parcel delivery. However, suffering from limited payloads and battery capacities, it is uneconomical for UAVs to perform parcel delivery tasks independently. To conquer the drawbacks of low payloads and battery capacities, people propose to employ both trucks and drones to construct truck-drone parcel delivery systems. However, previous works only leverage either independent drones or truck-carried drones to collaborate with trucks. In contrast, in this article we propose to simultaneously employ trucks, truck-carried drones, and independent drones to construct a more efficient truck-drone parcel delivery system. We claim that such a hybrid parcel delivery system can fully exploit the complementary benefits of the three platforms. We propose a novel routing and scheduling algorithm, referred to as hybrid truck-drone delivery (HTDD) algorithm, to solve the hybrid parcel delivery problem, wherein M drones carried by M trucks, together with N independent drones, cooperate to deliver parcels to customers distributed in a wide region.

However, the response delay of longitudinal velocity prevents the parking controller from tracing the desired trajectory because the vehicle’s velocity and other state parameters are not synchronized, while the controller maneuvers the vehicle according to the planned desired velocity and steering profiles. We propose an inverse vehicle model to provide a neural-network-based integrated lateral and longitudinal automatic parking controller. We approximated the relationship of the planned velocity to the vehicle’s velocity using a second-order difference equation that involves the response characteristic of the vehicle’s longitudinal delay. The adjusted desired velocity to track the origin-planned velocity is calculated using the inverse vehicle model. Furthermore, we proposed an integrated longitudinal and lateral parking controller using an artificial neural network (ANN) model trained on a dataset applying the inverse vehicle model. By learning the control laws between the vehicle’s states and the corresponding actions, the proposed ANN-based controller could yield a steering angle and the adjusted desired velocity to complete automatic parking in a confined space. © 2019 by the authors.

Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and Angle of Arrival (AOA) measurements processing are the most wide-spread techniques for passive geolocation systems. Successful implementation of TDOA-AOA positioning in existing UAV based geolocation systems achieves accuracy results of tens and hundreds of meters for overoptimistic scenarios without reflections in so called Line of Sight (LOS) conditions. Prevailing application specific cases for UAV based positioning include search and rescue (S&R) operations in mountains, hills and other regions of irregular surface topography with Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) conditions, where radio waves could experience severe reflection and diffraction. For geolocation tasks NLOS problem usually leads to significant errors for both TDOA and AOA measurement processing techniques. Joint processing of TDOA and AOA primary measurements could partially overcome this problem by preliminary identification and exclusion of reflected signals. In current research we refine existing mathematical model and develop new simulation models to investigate NLOS tolerance during positioning with one stationary ground sensor and one sensor aboard flying UAV using joint TDOA-AOA measurement processing technique.

Typical characteristics of UAV attack on power grids are analyzed and summarized in five aspects: difficult to be detected, hard to be foiled, nonsensitive, clustered and precise. To illustrate the feasibility of UAV attack, UAV short-circuit attack mode is proposed as an effective way to attack against the grid. We analyze the feasibility of UAV short-circuit attack mode by establishing a mathematical model, and verify the feasibility based on various short-circuit materials. UAV frequency attack strategies are discussed to show the severe damage inflicted by UAV attack. Among them, Multipoint Multistage Attack (MMA) strategy can result in rapid collapse of the frequency by implementing a series of attacks precisely. Compared to Multipoint Simultaneous Attack (MSA) strategy, the MMA strategy can utilize both the characteristics of UAVs and vulnerability of system frequency. The proposed strategies are evaluated by a dynamic frequency simulation model.

In particular, the RoboVaaS vision includes a ship hull inspection service, a quay walls inspection service, an antigrounding service, and an environmental and bathymetry data collection service. In this paper, we present a study of the underwater environmental data collection service, performed by a low-cost autonomous vehicle equipped with both a commercial modem and a very low-cost acoustic modem prototype, the smartPORT Acoustic Underwater Modem (AHOI). The vehicle mules the data from a network of low cost submerged acoustic sensor nodes to a surface sink. To this end, an underwater acoustic network composed by both static and moving nodes has been implemented and simulated with the DESERT Underwater Framework, where the performance of the AHOI modem has been mapped in the form of lookup tables. The performance of the AHOI modem has been measured near the Port of Hamburg, where the RoboVaaS concept will be demonstrated with a real field evaluation. The transmission with the commercial modem, instead, has been simulated with the Bellhop ray tracer thanks to theWorld Ocean Simulation System (WOSS), by considering both the bathymetry and the sound speed profile of the Port of Hamburg. The set up of the polling-based MAC protocol parameters, such as the maximum backoff time of the sensor nodes, appears to be crucial for the network performance, in particular for the low-cost low-rate modems. In this work, to tune the maximum backoff time during the data collection mission, an adaptive mechanism has been implemented. Specifically, the maximum backoff time is updated based on the network density.

One modification that is used at this time is by adding end wall which is often referred to as a winglet. Winglets function as a barrier to fluid flow jumps from the lower surface to the upper surface. This fluid flow jumps is often called as a tip vortex. One type of winglet discussed in this study is the wingtip fence.

Despite the inherent potentials, one challenging problem is how to optimally deploy multiple UAVs to achieve on-demand coverage for ground user equipment (UE). In this article, we model the deployment problem as minimizing the number of UAVs and maximizing the load balance among them, which is subject to two main constraints, i.e., UAVs should form a robust backbone network and they should keep connected with the fixed BSs. To solve this optimization problem with low complexity, we decompose the problem into two subproblems and propose a hybrid algorithm to solve them stepwise. First, a centralized greedy search algorithm is used to heuristically obtain the minimum number of UAVs and their suboptimal positions in a discontinuous space. Then, a distributed motion algorithm is adopted which enables each UAV to autonomously control its motion toward the optimal position in a continuous space. The proposed algorithm is applicable to various scenarios where UAVs are deployed alone or with fixed BSs regardless of the UE distribution. Extensive simulations validate the proposed algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

This is of particular interest for wildlife conservation: Given a set of images acquired with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and manually labeled ground truth, our goal is to train an animal detector that can be reused for repeated acquisitions, e.g., in follow-up years. Domain shifts between data sets typically prevent such a direct model application. We thus propose to bridge this gap using AL and introduce a new criterion called Transfer Sampling (TS). TS uses Optimal Transport (OT) to find corresponding regions between the source and the target data sets in the space of CNN activations. The CNN scores in the source data set are used to rank the samples according to their likelihood of being animals, and this ranking is transferred to the target data set. Unlike conventional AL criteria that exploit model uncertainty, TS focuses on very confident samples, thus allowing quick retrieval of true positives in the target data set, where positives are typically extremely rare and difficult to find by visual inspection. We extend TS with a new window cropping strategy that further accelerates sample retrieval. Our experiments show that with both strategies combined, less than half a percent of oracle-provided labels are enough to find almost 80% of the animals in challenging sets of UAV images, beating all baselines by a margin. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, the current localization technology mainly depends on GPS or wireless network, which is prone to be interfered by the environment and wireless attack. To solve this issue, we propose a vision based deep matching network for UAV by a image auxiliary localization algorithm. The proposed algorithm integrates vision information and traditional wireless localization information by an information fusion filter to realize more robust localization. The deep matching network realizes localization prediction of image stream by matching the extract features with stored memory segments. The image stream is firstly inputted to a convolutional neural network to extract image features. Then a LSTM is employed to extract localization features from image features. Finally, the matching network will output the localization prediction from the image features and stored memory segments. After experiment, compared to existing method, the mean localization error performance of the proposed approach can mostly improve 49.8%. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To reduce handover signaling overhead, the ground BSs take charge of control signaling delivery whereas the UAVs are in charge of payload data transmission so that users need to be simultaneously associated with a ground BS and a UAV in this network with a control-data plane-split architecture. We first propose a three-dimensional (3D) location distribution model of the UAVs using stochastic geometry which is able to generally characterize the positions of the UAVs in the sky. Using this 3D distribution model of UAVs, two performance metrics, i.e., multi-cell coverage probability and volume spectral efficiency, are proposed. Their explicit low-complexity expressions are derived and their upper limits are found when each of the UAVs and ground BSs is equipped with a massive antenna array. We further show that the multi-cell coverage probability and the volume spectral efficiency can be maximized by optimally deploying and positioning the UAVs in the sky and thereby their fundamental maximal limits are found. These important analytical findings are validated by numerical simulations. © 1983-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The present study focuses on performing computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis on examining the vortex formation, turbulent regimes, wake region, tip vortex formulation and ground effect. Preliminary flow analysis is performed to determine the angle of attack (AoA) and wind speed on which minimal drag is experienced by the amphibious structure. Further, analysis conducted through varying the relative velocity of the vehicle and changing the speed of the propellers. The pressure distribution across the fuselage and rotor surface predicted the stability of the vehicle. The ground effect is examined through varying the clearance between the vehicle and ground surface with respect to a multiplicity of rotor diameter.

Such incursions often lead to extensive airport shutdowns due to safety concern and could cause a cascading disruption to airline operations throughout the region. A better assessment tool for the collision risk between the existing air traffic and such non-cooperative intruder could help reduce unnecessary disruption while maintaining safety to air traffic operations. While advancements have been made in the past decade in detection and avoidance of UAS traffics, the systems depend on either having fully cooperative traffic or sensor capability beyond what is currently available. This paper seeks to assess the collision risk posed by an intruding UAS within the airport-restricted “terminal airspace,” in the Singapore context, with minimal information on the UAS. This was done through probabilistic conflict prediction with Monte-Carlo simulations under the assumption of a worst-case scenario involving a non-cooperative intruder traveling directly towards the flight corridor. Alert Zones within the existing 5 km terminal airspace could be constructed using the collision prediction models to help air traffic controllers quickly identifying UAS that poses a threat under most circumstances, with the information passed on to the pilot for mitigation actions. Simulations were conducted for a number of conflict-pairs to investigate how the resulting Alert Zones differ. Finally, this paper also investigates how the incorporation of UAS tracking information, under the current reliability level, could be used to augment the collision prediction algorithm and its effect on the management of collision risks in terminal airspace. The result suggested that the method that utilizes the most available information for UAS path modeling could be used with the currently available sensors to produce acceptable collision prediction results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

This process is in the air outside the glove box. To further improve the performance of QD solar cells, the short-chain ligand of phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr) with a benzene group is introduced to partially substitute for the original long-chain ligands of the colloidal QD surface (namely PTABr-CsPbI3). This process not only enhances the carrier charge mobility within the QD film due to shortening length between adjacent QDs, but also passivates the halide vacancy defects of QD by Br− from PTABr. The colloidal QD solar cells show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.2% with an open voltage of 1.11 V, a short current density of 14.4 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 0.70. Due to the hydrophobic surface chemistry of the PTABr–CsPbI3 film, the solar cell can maintain 80% of the initial PCE in ambient conditions for one month without any encapsulation.

They are increasing in adoption in many industrial sectors. RVs rely on sensors and actuators for system operations and navigation. Control algorithm based estimation techniques have been used in RVs to minimize the effects of noisy sensors, prevent faulty actuator output, and recently, in detecting attacks against RVs. In this paper, we propose three kinds of attacks to evade the control-based detection techniques and cause RVs to malfunction. We also propose automated algorithms for performing the attacks without requiring the attacker to expend significant effort or know specific details of the RV, making the attacks applicable to a wide range of RVs. We demonstrate these attacks on ArduPilot simulators and two real RVs (a drone and a rover) in the presence of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using control estimation models to monitor the runtime behavior of the system. We find that the control models are incapable of detecting our stealthy attacks, and that the attacks can have significant adverse impact on the RV’s mission (e.g., cause the RV to crash or deviate from its target significantly). © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

The emerging quantum cryptography, harnessing the random nature of quantum mechanics, may also enable unconditionally secure control network, beyond the applications in secure communications. Here, we present a quantum-enhanced cryptographic remote control scheme that combines quantum randomness and one-time pad algorithm for delivering commands remotely. We experimentally demonstrate this on an unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) control system. We precharge quantum random numbers (QRN) into controller and controlee before launching UAV, instead of distributing QRN like standard quantum communication during flight. We statistically verify the randomness of both quantum keys and the converted ciphertexts to check the security capability. All commands in the air are found to be completely chaotic after encryption, and only matched keys on UAV can decipher those commands precisely. In addition, the controlee does not response to the commands that are not or incorrectly encrypted, showing the immunity against interference and decoy.

Understanding fire behaviour in spinifex grasslands informs prescribed burning and wildfire suppression activities. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are aiding in improving fire behaviour prediction by providing comprehensive and accurate measurements of vegetation cover, volume and height, the fuel characteristics of vegetation that influence fire behaviour. Classification of spinifex cover derived from UAS image capture has been compared to field transects. Data from UAS align better with Landsat satellite imagery than fuel cover measures from field transects. A good correlation was found between UAS-derived vegetation cover and Landsat imagery, which means satellite imagery can be used with confidence to estimate and map fuel cover at a range of temporal and spatial scales. UAS have also proven useful in the development of a spectral index describing spinifex cover. The rapid development of affordable UAS instruments and software has enabled the production of point clouds, which provide further vegetation structure information not available from previous image captures. These developments in UAS application together with satellite imagery will enable fire managers to more efficiently and accurately map fuel characteristics at a range of scales, greatly enhancing their ability to forecast fire danger and to predict fire behaviour without having to carry out costly ground-based field measurements. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","Scopus"

While state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for sample classification continue to push boundaries in terms of performance, most of these methods are not able to integrate different data types and lack generalization power, limiting their application in a clinical setting. Furthermore, many methods behave as black boxes, and we have very little understanding about the mechanisms that lead to the prediction. While opaqueness concerning machine behavior might not be a problem in deterministic domains, in health care, providing explanations about the molecular factors and phenotypes that are driving the classification is crucial to build trust in the performance of the predictive system. We propose Pathway-Induced Multiple Kernel Learning (PIMKL), a methodology to reliably classify samples that can also help gain insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the classification. PIMKL exploits prior knowledge in the form of a molecular interaction network and annotated gene sets, by optimizing a mixture of pathway-induced kernels using a Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) algorithm, an approach that has demonstrated excellent performance in different machine learning applications. After optimizing the combination of kernels to predict a specific phenotype, the model provides a stable molecular signature that can be interpreted in the light of the ingested prior knowledge and that can be used in transfer learning tasks. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, open communication among the entities in an edge based IoT environment makes it vulnerable to various potential attacks that are executed by an adversary. Device authentication is one of the prominent techniques in security that permits an IoT device to authenticate mutually with a cloud server with the help of an edge node. If authentication is successful, they establish a session key between them for secure communication. To achieve this goal, a novel device authentication and key management mechanism for the edge based IoT environment, called the lightweight authentication and key management scheme for the edge based IoT environment (LDAKM-EIoT), was designed. The detailed security analysis and formal security verification conducted by the widely used “Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA)” tool prove that the proposed LDAKM-EIoT is secure against several attack vectors that exist in the infrastructure of the edge based IoT environment. The elaborated comparative analysis of the proposed LDAKM-EIoT and different closely related schemes provides evidence that LDAKM-EIoT is more secure with less communication and computation costs.

Additionally, drones themselves can be subject to unlawful interference. In this article, I analyze how European Union’s new rules on drones affect such security threats. I argue that the rules on protecting drones from unlawful interference are promising, although the required security features can also be abused by rogue operators. The intentional misuse of drones, however, is not much deterred by the rules that seek to protect persons and property from such misuse. Rules concerning the operator and the pilot assume compliance, the mandatory technical safeguards can be circumvented, and oversight is difficult because drones are mostly operated from outside airports in a distributed manner. One way to fill the security gap is to employ anti-drone technology that detects drones and prevents them from entering sensitive airspace without permission. Although many airports have already adopted such technology, the EU should consider making it mandatory for the busiest airports. Regardless of rules enacted by the Union, though, reliable and safe means of stopping unlawful drone operations should be employed at critical locations. This applies also to areas like prisons and power plants, the protection of which falls within the ambit of national security. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

The aim of this work is to develop a methodology for automated construction of patient-specific computational phantoms based on actual patient CT images to enable accurate estimation of conceptus dose. Methods: We developed a 3D deep convolutional network algorithm for automated segmentation of CT images to build realistic computational phantoms. The neural network architecture consists of analysis and synthesis paths with four resolution levels each, trained on manually labeled CT scans of six identified anatomical structures. Thirty-two CT exams were augmented to 128 datasets and randomly split into 80%/20% for training/testing. The absorbed doses for six segmented organs/tissues from abdominal CT scans were estimated using Monte Carlo calculations. The resulting radiation doses were then compared between the computational models generated using automated segmentation and manual segmentation, serving as reference. Results: The Dice similarity coefficient for identified internal organs between manual segmentation and automated segmentation results varies from 0.92 to 0.98 while the mean Hausdorff distance for the uterus is 16.1 mm. The mean absorbed dose for the uterus is 2.9 mGy whereas the mean organ dose differences between manual and automated segmentation techniques are 0.07%, − 0.45%, − 1.55%, − 0.48%, − 0.12%, and 0.28% for the kidney, liver, lung, skeleton, uterus, and total body, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed methodology allows automated construction of realistic computational models that can be exploited to estimate patient-specific organ radiation doses from radiological imaging procedures. Key Points: • The conceptus dose during diagnostic radiology and nuclear medicine imaging procedures for pregnant patients raises health concerns owing to the high radiosensitivity of the developing embryo/fetus. • The proposed methodology allows automated construction of realistic computational models that can be exploited to estimate patient-specific organ radiation doses from radiological imaging procedures. • The dosimetric results can be used for the risk-benefit analysis of radiation hazards to conceptus from diagnostic imaging procedures, thus guiding the decision-making process. © 2019, European Society of Radiology.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Ants must respond to changing resource conditions, but exploration comes at a cost of higher potential exposure to threats. Fungal infected cadavers surround the main foraging trails of the carpenter ant Camponotus rufipes, offering a system to study how foragers behave given the persistent occurrence of disease threats. Studies on social insect foraging behavior typically require many hours of human labor due to the high density of individuals. To overcome this, we developed deep learning based computer vision algorithms to track foraging ants, frame-by-frame, from video footage shot under the natural conditions of a tropical forest floor at night. We found that most foragers walk in straight lines overlapping the same areas as other ants, but there is a subset of foragers with greater exploration. Consistency in walking behavior may protect most ants from infection, while foragers that explore unique portions of the trail may be more likely to encounter fungal spores implying a trade-off between resource discovery and risk avoidance. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","Scopus"

Utilizing a pre-clinical biopsy model, we optimized three imaging parameters that may affect the specificity of HS-27 based diagnostics – time between tissue excision and staining, agent incubation time, and agent dose, and translated our strategy to clinical breast cancer samples. Findings indicated that HS-27 florescence was highest in tumor tissue, followed by benign tissue, and finally followed by mammoplasty negative control samples. Interestingly, fluorescence in tumor samples was highest in Her2+ and triple negative subtypes, and inversely correlated with the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes indicating that HS-27 fluorescence increases in aggressive breast cancer phenotypes.

In this paper, we propose flow-level models (FLM) for realistically characterizing the UAVBSN performance in terms of a broad range of flow- and system-level metrics. Further, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that relies on the UAVBSN FLM for learning the optimal traffic-aware UAV trajectories. For a given user traffic density and starting UAV locations, our RL approach learns the optimal UAV trajectories offline that maximizes a cumulative performance metric. We then execute the learned UAV trajectories in a discrete event simulator to evaluate online UAVBSN performance. For {M}\pmb {=} 9 UAVs deployed in a simulated Downtown San Francisco model, where the UAV trajectories are defined by {N}\pmb {=} 20 discrete actions, our approach achieves approximately a three-fold increase in the average user throughput compared to the initial UAV placement, while simultaneously balancing traffic loads across the BSs. © 2015 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"

As seen in nature, birds like the albatross utilize the temperature effects resulting from their wings’ color to increase their flight efficiency. In this paper, the effects that differences in surface temperatures of birds’ black/white wings, colored flat plates, and airfoils with heating films is investigated. Such effects are applicable to the efficiency of fixed-wing drones. Experimentally, it is observed that the surface temperature of black birds’ wings is over 50% higher than white wings under solar radiation. The application of a novel heated top surface on five airfoils results in the drag coefficient decreasing up to 60% and the lift coefficient increasing up to 70% for some airfoils in specified angles of attack compared to a non-heated top surface. This method of utilizing thermal effects can be considered as a new applicable way to increase the flight efficiency in fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. © 2019","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this context, neuroradiologists need efficient tools for interventional planning and microcatheter embolization procedures optimization. Thus, the development of helpful methods is necessary to solve this challenging issue. Methods: A complete pipeline aiming to assist neuroradiologists in the visualization, interpretation and exploitation of three-dimensional rotational angiographic (3DRA) images for interventions planning in case of AVM is proposed. The developed method consists of two steps. First, an automated 3D region-based segmentation of the cerebral vessels which feed and drain the AVM is performed. From this, a graph-like tree representation of these connected vessels is then built. This symbolic representation provides a vascular network modelization with hierarchical and geometrical features that helps in the understanding of the complex angioarchitecture of the AVM. Results: The developed workflow achieves the segmentation of the vessels and of the malformation. It improves the 3D visualization of this complex network and highlights its three main components that are the arteries, the veins and the nidus. The symbolic representation then brings a better comprehension of the vessels angioarchitecture. It provides decomposition into topologically related vessels, offering the possibility to reduce the complexity due to the malformed vessels and also determine the optimal paths for AVM embolization during interventions planning. Conclusions: A relevant vascular network modelization has been developed that constitutes a breakthrough in the assistance of neuroradiologists for AVM endovascular embolization planning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

It opens the deltaic environment up to severe ocean waves and tide attack, which threatens vulnerable coastal communities and increases the risk of the inhabitants. Changes in the beach sediment systems vary from few meters to several kilometres and from hours/days (short term) to decades (long term). Various methods have been developed to analyse changes in beach sediments. This study used Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV or Drone) approach to assess short-term sediment dynamics (from April 2017 to April 2018) in three vulnerable beach systems at Old Ningo (west), Fuveme (central) and Keta (east) communities within the Volta Delta coast in Ghana. High-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were developed from the drone images captured, which enabled perpendicular profiles to be generated. Sampled sediments were analysed to determine variation in sizes along the coast. Analysis of the profiles revealed that for the period between April 2017 and April 2018, the beach system at Ningo recorded a net loss of about 8,850 m3 volume of sediment; at Fuvemeh the beach system gained about 12,700 m3 net volume of sediment; in Keta the beach system also gained about 12,100 m3 net volume of sediment. Sediment size analysis revealed that the western section has a relatively finer grain size compared to the east. The coast experienced lower waves between January and February and higher waves between July and August. The pattern of change in the sediment dynamics follows the changing trend in the wave height observed in the region. This indicates that wave dynamics is a major driver of short term sediment change in the Volta delta beach systems. Increased wave intensity as a result of climate change will have a significant impact on the delta beach systems, which will increase erosion and flooding incidence. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

DFNs find applications in modelling geothermal heat recovery, hydrocarbon exploitation, and groundwater flow. It is advantageous to construct DFNs from the photogrammetry of fractured outcrop analogues as the DFNs would capture realistic, fracture network properties. Recent advances in drone photogrammetry have greatly simplified the process of acquiring outcrop images, and there is a remarkable increase in the volume of image data that can be routinely generated. However, manually digitizing fracture traces is time-consuming and inevitably subject to interpreter bias. Additionally, variations in interpretation style can result in different fracture network geometries, which, may then influence modelling results depending on the use case of the fracture study. In this paper, an automated fracture trace detection technique is introduced. The method consists of ridge detection using the complex shearlet transform coupled with post-processing algorithms that threshold, skeletonize, and vectorize fracture traces. The technique is applied to the task of automatic trace extraction at varying scales of rock discontinuities, ranging from 10° to 102m. We present automatic trace extraction results from three different fractured outcrop settings. The results indicate that the automated approach enables the extraction of fracture patterns at a volume beyond what is manually feasible. Comparative analysis of automatically extracted results with manual interpretations demonstrates that the method can eliminate the subjectivity that is typically associated with manual interpretation. The proposed method augments the process of characterizing rock fractures from outcrops. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The proposed methodology first extracts the ECG localized features including PR interval, QRS complex, and QT interval from the continuous ECG waveform using features extraction logic, then the PSR technique is applied to get the phase portraits of all the localized features. Based on the cleanliness and contour of the phase portraits CVD classification will be done. This is first of its kind approach where the localized features of ECG are being taken into considerations unlike the state-of-art approaches, where the entire ECG beats have been considered. The proposed methodology is generic and can be extended to most of the CVD cases. It is verified on the PTBDB and IAFDB databases by taking the CVD including Atrial Fibrillation, Myocardial Infarction, Bundle Branch Block, Cardiomyopathy, Dysrhythmia, and Hypertrophy. The methodology has been tested on 65 patients’ data for the classification of abnormalities in PR interval, QRS complex, and QT interval. Based on the obtained statistical results, to detect the abnormality in PR interval, QRS complex and QT interval the Coefficient Variation (CV) should be greater than or equal to 0.1012, 0.083, 0.082 respectively with individual accuracy levels of 95.3%, 96.9%, and 98.5% respectively. To justify the clinical significance of the proposed methodology, the Confidence Interval (CI), the p-value using ANOVA have been computed.

In particular, the attacks mounted from remote, well-hidden positions around roads are considered the most apparent danger. So far, there have been three approaches to validating V2X message content: checking based on sensor fusion, behavior analysis, and communication constraints.

However, these changes are by no means proven and linear as different levels of automation show risk-related idiosyncrasies. A lack of empirical data aggravates the transparent evaluation of risk arising from CAVs with higher levels of automation capability. Nevertheless, it is likely that the risks associated with CAV will profoundly reshape the risk profile of the global motor insurance industry. This paper conducts a deep qualitative analysis of the impact of progressive vehicle automation and interconnectedness on the risks covered under motor third-party and comprehensive insurance policies. This analysis is enhanced by an assessment of potential emerging risks such as the risk of cyber-attacks. We find that, in particular, primary insurers focusing on private retail motor insurance face significant strategic risks to their business model. The results of this analysis are not only relevant for insurance but also from a regulatory perspective as we find a symbiotic relationship between an insurance-related assessment and a comprehensive evaluation of CAV’s inherent societal costs. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","Scopus"

The main focus is to investigate the effects of changing the components of wing design when the aircraft climbs and accelerates. These component modifications included changing the airfoil, planform, aspect ratio, and adding a winglet. Another objective is to study the efficacy of employing high-lift airfoils like the EPPLER 559 for subsonic unmanned aerial vehicle applications. For this, five wing designs are considered in this paper. Computational fluid dynamics simulations using ANSYS FLUENT® are conducted for each wing design. The CL/CD ratios for all the wings are calculated at increasing angles of attack (simulating Climbing) and increasing speed (simulating Acceleration). Compared to the NACA 4415 airfoil, which is utilized by the RQ-7 Shadow, the EPPLER 559 provides an increase in lift at the low angles of attack, but yields less of these benefits as the angle of attack increases. The tapered planform significantly reduces the high drag associated with the EPPLER 559 airfoil. The generation of higher lift forces with lower drag is further achieved by increasing the aspect ratio and through the addition of a winglet. When compared to the NACA 4415 airfoil, it is concluded that the EPPLER 559 airfoil is a viable candidate for subsonic unmanned aerial vehicle applications only when the components of wing design are altered. The performance of the wings that employ the EPPLER 559 airfoil improves when the planform is changed from rectangular to tapered, when the aspect ratio is increased and when a winglet is added. © IMechE 2019.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Reliable maps at very-high spatial resolution are needed to assess invasions dynamics. Field sampling approaches could be replaced by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to derive such maps. However, pixel-based species classification at high spatial resolution is highly affected by within-canopy variation caused by shadows. Here, we studied the effect of shadows on mapping the occurrence of invasive species using UAV-based data. MaxEnt one-class classifications were applied to map Acacia dealbata, Ulex europaeus and Pinus radiata in central-south Chile using combinations of UAV-based spectral (RGB and hyperspectral), 2D textural and 3D structural variables including and excluding shaded canopy pixels during model calibration. The model accuracies in terms of area under the curve (AUC), Cohen's Kappa, sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) were examined in sunlit and shaded canopies separately. Bootstrapping was used for validation and to assess statistical differences between models. Our results show that shadows significantly affect the accuracies obtained with all types of variables. The predictions in shaded areas were generally inaccurate, leading to misclassification rates between 65% and 100% even when shadows were included during model calibration. The exclusion of shaded areas from model calibrations increased the predictive accuracies (especially in terms of sensitivity), decreasing false positives. Spectral and 2D textural information showed generally higher performances and improvements when excluding shadows from the analysis. Shadows significantly affected the model results obtained with any of the variables used, hence the exclusion of shadows is recommended prior to model calibration. This relatively easy pre-processing step enhances models for classifying species occurrences using high-resolution spectral imagery and derived products. Finally, a shadow simulation showed differences in the ideal acquisition window for each species, which is important to plan revisit campaigns. © 2019 The Authors.

In this article, we make two primary contributions. First, we develop a novel general-purpose incremental covariance update technique, which efficiently recovers specific covariance entries after any change in probabilistic inference, such as the introduction of new observations/variables or relinearization. Our approach is shown to recover them faster than other state-of-the-art methods. Second, we present a computationally efficient approach for BSP in high-dimensional state spaces, leveraging our incremental covariance update method. State-of-the-art BSP approaches perform belief propagation for each candidate action and then evaluate an objective function that typically includes an information-theoretic term, such as entropy or information gain. Yet, candidate actions often have similar parts (e.g., common trajectory parts), which are however evaluated separately for each candidate. Moreover, calculating the information-theoretic term involves a costly determinant computation of the entire information (covariance) matrix, which is O(n3) with n being dimension of the state or costly Schur complement operations if only marginal posterior covariance of certain variables is of interest. Our approach, rAMDL-Tree, extends our previous BSP method rAMDL, by exploiting incremental covariance calculation and performing calculation reuse between common parts of non-myopic candidate actions, such that these parts are evaluated only once, in contrast to existing approaches. To that end, we represent all candidate actions together in a single unified graphical model, which we introduce and call a factor-graph propagation (FGP) action tree. Each arrow (edge) of the FGP action tree represents a sub-action of one (or more) candidate action sequence(s) and in order to evaluate its information impact we require specific covariance entries of an intermediate belief represented by the tree’s vertex from which the edge is coming out (e.g., tail of the arrow). Overall, our approach has only a one-time calculation that depends on (Formula presented.), while evaluating action impact does not depend on (Formula presented.). We perform a careful examination of our approaches in simulation, considering the problem of autonomous navigation in unknown environments, where rAMDL-Tree shows superior performance compared with rAMDL, while determining the same best actions. © The Author(s) 2019.","Article","Final","Scopus"

Sorption enhanced steam methane reforming (SESMR) is an emerging process for an affordable transition towards cleaner energy systems, as it exploits natural gas coupled with in-situ CO2 capture to produce hydrogen. SESMR is performed on a steam reforming catalyst and a sorbent (cyclically regenerated by calcination) or, alternatively and more efficiently, on bi-functional Combined Sorbent-Catalyst Materials (CSCM). A double fluidized bed (reformer and oxyfuel combustor for calcination) with circulation of particulate material is anticipated for continuous SESMR at commercial scale. In this work, a Ni-CaO-mayenite CSCM was investigated in multicycle experimental tests under mild (pure N2, 850 °C) and severe (pure CO2, 925 °C) regeneration conditions, in thermogravimetric analysis for CO2-capture/regeneration and in an automated packed bed test rig for SESMR/calcination: the evolution of Ni and CaO functionalities as functions of cycle number was highlighted, also with the aid of scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, experimental results obtained with the hybrid material, collected under mild regeneration conditions, were used to simulate both CO2 sorption in TGA and packed bed SESMR multicycle tests: a Particle Grain Model (PGM) and an Axial Dispersion Plug Flow Reactor (ADPFR) model were integrated numerically, respectively. The same parameter values needed to characterize the material behaviour allowed a good fitting of both types of multicycle tests, thus demonstrating the possibility to use CO2-capture TGA data as a predictive tool for the CSCM performance in SESMR, provided that the catalytic activity is preserved. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, unlike humans, CNNs are “fooled” by adversarial examples—nonsense patterns that machines recognize as familiar objects, or seemingly irrelevant image perturbations that nevertheless alter the machine’s classification. Such bizarre behaviors challenge the promise of these new advances; but do human and machine judgments fundamentally diverge? Here, we show that human and machine classification of adversarial images are robustly related: In 8 experiments on 5 prominent and diverse adversarial imagesets, human subjects correctly anticipated the machine’s preferred label over relevant foils—even for images described as “totally unrecognizable to human eyes”.

The proposed shared control framework is established from a novel cooperative trajectory planning algorithm and a fuzzy steering controller. Based on polynomial functions, the cooperative trajectory planning is formulated by judiciously exploiting the information on the maneuver decision, the conflict management, and the driver monitoring. As a result, the planned trajectory of the vehicle is continuously adapted according to the driver's actions and intentions. By means of Lyapunov stability arguments, sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are given to design a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model-based controller. This robust steering controller provides a necessary assistive torque to track the planned vehicle trajectory.

The advantages of the proposed approach are evaluated using both objective and subjective results, experimentally obtained from several human drivers and an advanced interactive dynamic driving simulator. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","Scopus"
"A shot in the dark: Sport hunting of declining corvids promotes the inadvertent shooting of threatened red-billed choughs","2019","Journal for Nature Conservation","10.1016/j.jnc.2019.125739","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071994351&doi=10.1016%2fj.jnc.2019.125739&partnerID=40&md5=fa67881fa9f248537e65c32a86a0d09b","Inadvertent shooting of protected species due to misidentification or spatio-temporal coincidence with more abundant target species of similar appearance and habits is a frequent side-effect of sport hunting. Protected corvid species of special conservation concern were present in all Spanish Autonomous regions where hunting of corvids of similar appearance and habits is legally permitted.We assessed the extent to which Western jackdaws (Corvus monedula) and Red-billed choughs (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) shared distributions in central Spain, and whether this can cause mortality and temporary and permanent crippling of threatened and strictly protected choughs. About 1000–3000 ‘black corvids’ were annually hunted in the Madrid region without species-specific identification according to official statistics. Assuming that these corvids were mostly jackdaws, this accounted for about 5–20% of the total estimated winter population of this declining species. Jackdaws and choughs shared local distribution ranges and their abundances were spatially correlated during winter. The abundance of jackdaws was positively correlated with the estimates of killed black corvids (including jackdaws and Carrion crows, Corvus corone, which were not identified to species in hunting statistics). As with jackdaws, hunting was the main cause of mortality of choughs. The impact of hunting on non-target choughs can be strong—even live individuals can be temporarily affected by damage to flight feathers or other wounds, and birds can be crippled for life when shooting affects the bill or other body parts. To date, there is no framework for informed decision-making in game management or any published evidence-based or standardized criteria supported by scientific research aimed to establish a hunting status or quotas for corvids and many other common bird species in Spain. This combination of subjectivity and a lack of information makes it near impossible to establish a harvesting scheme without putting at risk the populations of target and non-target species. Given the strong decline of currently hunted corvids in Spain (especially the jackdaw), the complete prohibition of hunting these species is urgently encouraged to attempt to avoid exacerbating the collapse of their populations and that of non-target species. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Article","Final","Scopus"

Their propulsion relies upon changing their buoyancy with internal pumping systems enabling them upward and downward motion. In the presented paper, the forward gliding motions are generated by hydrodynamic lift forces exerted on a pair of hydroplanes attached to a glider hull. The hydrodynamic characteristics of a glider were determined using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A 3D model was created for the simulation of flow behaviour in the Baltic Sea. The lift and drag forces distribution at different angles of attack was studied for Reynolds number 105. The flow velocity was 0.5 m•s-1 and the angle of the attack varied from-30° to 30° in steps of 2°. Results from the CFD constitute the basis for the calculation the equations of motions of the glider in 6 degrees of freedom. The vehicle motion simulation will be achieved through numeric integration of the equations of motion.

This paper addresses the problem of traffic congestion mitigation in a mixed scenario composed of connected human-driven and autonomous vehicles. The control protocol, driving the longitudinal motion of the autonomous vehicles, is designed for damping down traffic waves. The effectiveness of the strategy, and ability to cope with multiple and time-varying delays originated by the non-ideal wireless communication among connected vehicles, is both analytically and numerically analyzed. The asymptotic stability of the algorithm is mathematically proved by leveraging a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, while the head-to-tail stability tool is exploited for the tuning of the control gains. The performance of the control strategy is disclosed by using hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation for an exemplary pattern of three vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed cooperative strategy in longer queues of vehicles is, instead, investigated through PLEXE, an inter-vehicular communication and mobility simulator that includes features for autonomous vehicles as well as for the realistic emulation of the IEEE 802.11p standard.

However, existing portable approaches are either not capable of performing integrated on-site analysis or not yet practically applicable. Exploiting graphene oxide (GO) in enhancing the analytical performance of paper-based colorimetric detection, for the first time, this paper reports the development of a practically useful portable system for accurate, sensitive on-site characterization of trace metals in ambient particulate matter (PM). The system consists of GO-nanosheet-coated paper devices, unmanned aerial vehicle multiaxial sampling, and cellphone-based colorimetric detection. The increased specific surface area and the homogeneity of color distribution from the coating of GO improves the accuracy and sensitivity of the assays. Additionally, by leveraging a Wi-Fi camera, a self-developed app and a sample pretreatment cartridge, metal in PM samples can be readily processed and characterized on-site within 30 min. The effects of chip geometric design, pH, reaction volume, and metal interference on detection results have been studied. The detection limits of the system were calibrated to be 16.6, 5.1, and 9.9 ng for metals Fe, Cu, and Ni, respectively, which are comparable to the detection limits of commercial inductively coupled plasma (ICP) instruments, thus making our portable system practically useful. Finally, the system was used for airborne trace-metal study at 6 locations in Fuzhou City (China), and the results obtained using our system demonstrated good agreement with those obtained by the ICP.

An increase in the quantity of fish pens inside the lake threatens its water quality condition. One parameter being monitored is microalgal biomass by measuring Chlorophyll-a concentration. This study aims to generate a chlorophyll-a concentration model for easier monitoring of the lake. In-situ water quality data were collected using chl-a data logger and water quality meter at 357 and 12 locations, respectively. Using Parrot Sequoia+ Multispectral Camera, 1496 of 2148 images were acquired and calibrated, producing 18x18cm resolution Green (G), Red(R), Red Edge (RE) and Near Infrared (NIR) reflectance images. NIR was used to mask out non-water features, and to correct sun glint. The in-situ data and the pixel values extracted were used for Simple Linear Regression Analysis. A model with 5 variables-R/NIR, RE2, NIR2, R/NIR2, and NIR/RE2, was generated, yielding an R2 of 0.586 and RMSE of 0.958 μg/l. A chlorophyll-a concentration map was produced, showing that chl-a is higher where fish pens are located and lowers as it moves away from the pens. Although there are apparent fish pens on certain areas of the lake, it still yields low chlorophyll-a because of little amount of residential area or establishments adjacent to it. Also, not all fish pens have the same concentration of Chlorophyll-a due to inconsistent population per fish pen. The center of the lake has low chlorophyll-a as it is far from human activities. The only outlet, Sabang Creek, also indicates high concentration of Chlorophyll-a. © 2020 Authors.","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Even though there is a solid understanding of parasitic effects in hardware designs, the security implications of such undesired effects have been scarcely investigated. In this paper, we leverage the physical routing effects of capacitive crosstalk to demonstrate a new parametric hardware Trojan design methodology. We show that such Trojans can be implemented by only rerouting already existing resources. Thus, our approach possesses a zero-gate area overhead which is both stealthy and challenging to detect with standard visual inspection techniques. In two case studies, we demonstrate its devastating consequences: (1) we realize an implementation attack on a third-party cryptographic AES IP core and (2) we realize a privilege escalation on a general-purpose processor capable of running any modern operating system. In these case studies, we take special care to ensure that the Trojans do not violate design rule checks, which further highlights that the capacitive crosstalk Trojans can be building blocks for malicious circuitry design. We then investigate how state-of-the-art visual inspection techniques can be enhanced to cope with parametric hardware Trojans. In particular, we develop an automated layout-level mitigation approach which exploits the characteristic wire length of capacitive crosstalk Trojans.

Special algorithms for autonomous operation of an unmanned ground vehicle were developed, utilizing radiation characteristics acquired by the implemented detection system. The system was designed to operate in three modes: radiation mapping, localization of discrete sources and inspection of a region of interest. All of the modes were verified experimentally. In the localization mode, the time required to localize ionizing radiation sources was reduced by half compared to the field mapping mode exploiting parallel trajectories; the localization accuracy remained the same. In the inspection mode, the desired functionality was achieved, and the changes in the sources arrangement were detected reliably in the experiments. © The Author(s) 2019.

Although conventional approaches have achieved impressive performance, they suffer from the following limitations: (1) lane perception are confronted with different weather conditions and varied illumination. Existing methods lack a unified framework for characterizing different sceneries and (2) the inefficiency of utilizing images due to the potential label noise. To solve these limitations, we propose a lane detection framework towards autonomous vehicles by learning a full-reference quality-aware discriminative gradient deep model, where two types of deep networks are proposed. More specifically, we first design a gradient-guided deep convolutional network to detect the presence of lane, since the gradient value of lane edge is larger than that of other regions. We leverage full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) method to discover more discriminative gradient cues, and geometric attributes are exploited simultaneously. Subsequently, a recurrent neural layer is designed to represent the spatial distribution of detected lanes whose visual cues are difficult to explicitly define. Noticeably, we only utilize a small proportion of the labeled images, whereas the noisy features are abandoned using sparsity penalty.

Second, the constrained optimization problem is transformed into a series of convex optimization problems based on the equivalent transformation. Then, the convex optimization algorithm is used to iteratively solve the convex optimization problems, and interpolate the resulting path to get the path function.

Security is a pivotal issue for CPS, therefore, a trust-based active detection (TBAD) scheme is proposed for improving the reliability of collecting data packets and reducing the data redundancy. In TBAD scheme, the trust of the nodes is evaluated by the neighboring nodes and the evaluation results are added into the header of data packets. Thus, according to the reliability of data packets collected by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the trust of sensor nodes is evaluated by the UAV. In addition, the evaluation trust of nodes stored in the header of data packets will be detected when the UAV suspects the stored trust of sensor nodes. Then, the trust of corresponding sensor nodes is adjusted according to the detection results. The sensor nodes with higher trust are selected to form movement trajectory.

To exploit the automated authority file and to help streamline the handling of titles in series, Trinity University Library has developed a method to store cataloging and processing information in the online series authority record. The issue of how to integrate the pure tide authority function of the series authority record with the pragmatic aspects of processing titles in series is discussed. As a result of this integration at Trinity University, acquisitions staff, catalogers, and copy catalogers can easily obtain information about distribution and cataloging treatment of titles within series and analyzed serial tides. This procedure is adaptable to manual environments as well. © 1995 The Haworth Press, Inc.","Book chapter","Final","Scopus"
